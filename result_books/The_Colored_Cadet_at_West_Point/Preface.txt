The following pages were written by request. They claim to give an accurate and impartial narrative of my four years’ life while a cadet at West Point, as well as a general idea of the institution there. They are almost an exact transcription of notes taken at various times during those four years. Any inconsistencies, real or apparent, in my opinions or in the impressions made upon me, are due to the fact that they were made at different times at a place where the feelings of all were constantly undergoing material change. They do not pretend to merit. Neither are they written for the purpose of criticising the Military Academy or those in any way connected with it. My “notes” have been seen and read. If I please those who requested me to publish them I shall be content, as I have no other object in putting them before the public. H. O. F. FORT SILL, INDIAN TER., 1878.
