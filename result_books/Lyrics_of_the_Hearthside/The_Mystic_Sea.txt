The smell of the sea in my nostrils, The sound of the sea in mine ears; The touch of the spray on my burning face, Like the mist of reluctant tears. The blue of the sky above me, The green of the waves beneath; The sun flashing down on a gray–white sail Like a scimitar from its sheath. And ever the breaking billows, And ever the rocks’ disdain; And ever a thrill in mine inmost heart That my reason cannot explain. So I say to my heart, “Be silent, The mystery of time is here; Death’s way will be plain when we fathom the main, And the secret of life be clear.”
