A little dreaming by the way, A little toiling day by day; A little pain, a little strife, A little joy,—and that is life. A little short–lived summer’s morn, When joy seems all so newly born, When one day’s sky is blue above, And one bird sings,—and that is love. A little sickening of the years, The tribute of a few hot tears Two folded hands, the failing breath, And peace at last,—and that is death. Just dreaming, loving, dying so, The actors in the drama go— A flitting picture on a wall, Love, Death, the themes; but is that all?
