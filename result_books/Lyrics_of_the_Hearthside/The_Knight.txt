Our good knight, Ted, girds his broadsword on (And he wields it well, I ween); He ’s on his steed, and away has gone To the fight for king and queen. What tho’ no edge the broadsword hath? What tho’ the blade be made of lath? ‘T is a valiant hand That wields the brand, So, foeman, clear the path! He prances off at a goodly pace; ‘T is a noble steed he rides, That bears as well in the speedy race As he bears in battle–tides. What tho’ ‘t is but a rocking–chair That prances with this stately air? ‘T is a warrior bold The reins doth hold, Who bids all foes beware!
