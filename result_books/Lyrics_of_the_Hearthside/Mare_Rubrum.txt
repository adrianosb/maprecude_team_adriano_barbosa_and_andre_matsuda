In Life’s Red Sea with faith I plant my feet, And wait the sound of that sustaining word Which long ago the men of Israel heard, When Pharaoh’s host behind them, fierce and fleet, Raged on, consuming with revengeful heat. Why are the barrier waters still unstirred?— That struggling faith may die of hope deferred? Is God not sitting in His ancient seat? The billows swirl above my trembling limbs, And almost chill my anxious heart to doubt And disbelief, long conquered and defied. But tho’ the music of my hopeful hymns Is drowned by curses of the raging rout, No voice yet bids th’ opposing waves divide!
