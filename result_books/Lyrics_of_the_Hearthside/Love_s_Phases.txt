Love hath the wings of the butterfly, Oh, clasp him but gently, Pausing and dipping and fluttering by Inconsequently. Stir not his poise with the breath of a sigh; Love hath the wings of the butterfly. Love hath the wings of the eagle bold, Cling to him strongly— What if the look of the world be cold, And life go wrongly? Rest on his pinions, for broad is their fold; Love hath the wings of the eagle bold. Love hath the voice of the nightingale, Hearken his trilling— List to his song when the moonlight is pale,— Passionate, thrilling. Cherish the lay, ere the lilt of it fail; Love hath the voice of the nightingale. Love hath the voice of the storm at night, Wildly defiant. Hear him and yield up your soul to his might, Tenderly pliant. None shall regret him who heed him aright; Love hath the voice of the storm at night.
