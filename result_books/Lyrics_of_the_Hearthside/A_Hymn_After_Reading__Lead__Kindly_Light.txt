Lead gently, Lord, and slow, For oh, my steps are weak, And ever as I go, Some soothing sentence speak; That I may turn my face Through doubt’s obscurity Toward thine abiding–place, E’en tho’ I cannot see. For lo, the way is dark; Through mist and cloud I grope, Save for that fitful spark, The little flame of hope. Lead gently, Lord, and slow, For fear that I may fall; I know not where to go Unless I hear thy call. My fainting soul doth yearn For thy green hills afar; So let thy mercy burn— My greater, guiding star!
