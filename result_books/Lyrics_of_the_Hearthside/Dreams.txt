Dream on, for dreams are sweet: Do not awaken! Dream on, and at thy feet Pomegranates shall be shaken. Who likeneth the youth Of life to morning? ‘Tis like the night in truth, Rose–coloured dreams adorning. The wind is soft above, The shadows umber. (There is a dream called Love.) Take thou the fullest slumber! In Lethe’s soothing stream, Thy thirst thou slakest. Sleep, sleep; ‘t is sweet to dream. Oh, weep when thou awakest!
