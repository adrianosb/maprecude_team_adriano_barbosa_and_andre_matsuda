A life was mine full of the close concern Of many–voiced affairs. The world sped fast; Behind me, ever rolled a pregnant past. A present came equipped with lore to learn. Art, science, letters, in their turn, Each one allured me with its treasures vast; And I staked all for wisdom, till at last Thou cam’st and taught my soul anew to yearn. I had not dreamed that I could turn away From all that men with brush and pen had wrought; But ever since that memorable day When to my heart the truth of love was brought, I have been wholly yielded to its sway, And had no room for any other thought.
