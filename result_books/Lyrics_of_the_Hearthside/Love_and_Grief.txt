Out of my heart, one treach’rous winter’s day, I locked young Love and threw the key away. Grief, wandering widely, found the key, And hastened with it, straightway, back to me, With Love beside him. He unlocked the door And bade Love enter with him there and stay. And so the twain abide for evermore.
