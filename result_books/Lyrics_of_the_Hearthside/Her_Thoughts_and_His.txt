The gray of the sea, and the gray of the sky, A glimpse of the moon like a half–closed eye. The gleam on the waves and the light on the land, A thrill in my heart,—and—my sweetheart’s hand. She turned from the sea with a woman’s grace, And the light fell soft on her upturned face, And I thought of the flood–tide of infinite bliss That would flow to my heart from a single kiss. But my sweetheart was shy, so I dared not ask For the boon, so bravely I wore the mask. But into her face there came a flame:— I wonder could she have been thinking the same?
