There is a quiet garden, From the rude world set apart, Where seeds for Christ are growing; This is the loving heart. The tiny roots are loving thoughts; Sweet words, the fragrant flowers Which blossom into loving deeds,â€” Ripe fruits for harvest hours. Thus in our hearts the seeds of love Am growing year by year; And we show our love for the Savior, By loving His children here.
