I knew not ’twas so dire a crime To say the word, “Adieu;” But this shall be the only time My lips or heart shall sue. That wild hill-side, the winter morn, The gnarled and ancient tree, If in your breast they waken scorn, Shall wake the same in me. I can forget black eyes and brows, And lips of falsest charm, If you forget the sacred vows Those faithless lips could form. If hard commands can tame your love, Or strongest walls can hold, I would not wish to grieve above A thing so false and cold. And there are bosoms bound to mine With links both tried and strong: And there are eyes whose lightning shine Has warmed and blest me long: Those eyes shall make my only day, Shall set my spirit free, And chase the foolish thoughts away That mourn your memory.
