Heavy hangs the rain-drop From the burdened spray; Heavy broods the damp mist On uplands far away. Heavy looms the dull sky, Heavy rolls the sea; And heavy throbs the young heart Beneath that lonely tree. Never has a blue streak Cleft the clouds since morn; Never has his grim fate Smiled since he was born. Frowning on the infant, Shadowing childhood’s joy Guardian-angel knows not That melancholy boy. Day is passing swiftly Its sad and sombre prime; Boyhood sad is merging In sadder manhood’s time: All the flowers are praying For sun, before they close, And he prays too—unconscious— That sunless human rose. Blossom—that the west-wind Has never wooed to blow, Scentless are thy petals, Thy dew is cold as snow! Soul—where kindred kindness, No early promise woke, Barren is thy beauty, As weed upon a rock. Wither—soul and blossom! You both were vainly given; Earth reserves no blessing For the unblest of heaven! Child of delight, with sun-bright hair, And sea-blue, sea-deep eyes! Spirit of bliss! What brings thee here Beneath these sullen skies? Thou shouldst live in eternal spring, Where endless day is never dim; Why, Seraph, has thine erring wing Wafted thee down to weep with him? “Ah! not from heaven am I descended, Nor do I come to mingle tears; But sweet is day, though with shadows blended; And, though clouded, sweet are youthful years. “I—the image of light and gladness— Saw and pitied that mournful boy, And I vowed—if need were—to share his sadness, And give to him my sunny joy. “Heavy and dark the night is closing; Heavy and dark may its biding be: Better for all from grief reposing, And better for all who watch like me— “Watch in love by a fevered pillow, Cooling the fever with pity’s balm Safe as the petrel on tossing billow, Safe in mine own soul’s golden calm! “Guardian-angel he lacks no longer; Evil fortune he need not fear: Fate is strong, but love is stronger; And MY love is truer than angel-care.”
