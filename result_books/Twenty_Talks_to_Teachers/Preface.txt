Twenty Talks to Teachers is an epitome of some of the discussions used by the author in teachers’ institutes. It is not a profound book. It was not intended to be. Its object is to call the attention of young teachers to some of the every day problems which they must solve for themselves. The average term of service of teachers is little over three years, hence the great mass of teacher are young in service. A number of these have expressed themselves a being pleased with the discussions in institutes, especially so because they were plain homely talks rather than learned discussions. Perhaps these and other may appreciate them as well in the printed form. No one is expected to agree with all that is said. If the topics are suggestive to young teachers, if the book helps them over a few of the hard places, if it sets them thinking on some topics, if the advice that is given proves sound, and if it should encourage a few to deeper study, better preparation and broader reading, it will have done well. Trusting that it may form the basis of profitable discussions in teachers’ institutes and meeting it is submitted to the great body of young teachers whose zeal, enthusiasm and optimism, has done so much in the past, is doing yet, and will continue to do so much for our schools and out of whose work must grow in the future a worthy profession of teaching.
