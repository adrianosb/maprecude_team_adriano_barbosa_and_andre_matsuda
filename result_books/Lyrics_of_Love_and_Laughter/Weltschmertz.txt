You ask why I am sad to–day, I have no cares, no griefs, you say? Ah, yes, ‘t is true, I have no grief— But—is there not the falling leaf? The bare tree there is mourning left With all of autumn’s gray bereft; It is not what has happened me, Think of the bare, dismantled tree. The birds go South along the sky, I hear their lingering, long good–bye. Who goes reluctant from my breast? And yet—the lone and wind–swept nest. The mourning, pale–flowered hearse goes by, Why does a tear come to my eye? Is it the March rain blowing wild? I have no dead, I know no child. I am no widow by the bier Of him I held supremely dear. I have not seen the choicest one Sink down as sinks the westering sun. Faith unto faith have I beheld, For me, few solemn notes have swelled; Love bekoned me out to the dawn, And happily I followed on. And yet my heart goes out to them Whose sorrow is their diadem; The falling leaf, the crying bird, The voice to be, all lost, unheard— Not mine, not mine, and yet too much The thrilling power of human touch, While all the world looks on and scorns I wear another’s crown of thorns. Count me a priest who understands The glorious pain of nail–pierced hands; Count me a comrade of the thief Hot driven into late belief. Oh, mother’s tear, oh, father’s sigh, Oh, mourning sweetheart’s last good–bye, I yet have known no mourning save Beside some brother’s brother’s grave.
