When Phyllis sighs and from her eyes The light dies out; my soul replies] With misery of deep–drawn breath, E’en as it were at war with death. When Phyllis smiles, her glance beguiles My heart through love–lit woodland aisles, And through the silence high and clear, A wooing warbler’s song I hear. But if she frown, despair comes down, I put me on my sack–cloth gown; So frown not, Phyllis, lest I die, But look on me with smile or sigh.
