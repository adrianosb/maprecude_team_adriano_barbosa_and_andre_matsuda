If Death should claim me for her own to–day, And softly I should falter from your side, Oh, tell me, loved one, would my memory stay, And would my image in your heart abide? Or should I be as some forgotten dream, That lives its little space, then fades entire? Should Time send o’er you its relentless stream, To cool your heart, and quench for aye love’s fire? I would not for the world, love, give you pain, Or ever compass what would cause you grief; And, oh, how well I know that tears are vain! But love is sweet, my dear, and life is brief; So if some day before you I should go Beyond the sound and sight of song and sea, ‘T would give my spirit stronger wings to know That you remembered still and wept for me.
