At the golden gate of song Stood I, knocking all day long, But the Angel, calm and cold, Still refused and bade me, “Hold.” Then a breath of soft perfume, Then a light within the gloom; Thou, Love, camest to my side, And the gates flew open wide. Long I dwelt in this domain, Knew no sorrow, grief, or pain; Now you bid me forth and free, Will you shut these gates on me?
