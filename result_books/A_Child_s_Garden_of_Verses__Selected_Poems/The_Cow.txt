The friendly cow all red and white,       I love with all my heart: She gives me cream with all her might,       To eat with apple-tart. She wanders lowing here and there,       And yet she cannot stray, All in the pleasant open air,       The pleasant light of day; And blown by all the winds that pass       And wet with all the showers, She walks among the meadow grass       And eats the meadow flowers.
