[S] 14. “The author actually supposes that, because Professor Fawcett denies that all wealth is money, he denies that all money is wealth.” Analyse the differences of opinion implied in the above passage. [S] 15. Take any universal affirmative proposition; convert it by obversion (contraposition); attach the negative particle to the predicate, and again convert. Interpret the result exactly, and say whether it is or is not equivalent to the original proposition. [S] 16. What information about the term “solid body” can we derive from the proposition, “No bodies which are not solids are crystals”? [S] 17. Discuss the proposal to treat all propositions as affirmative. 18. Convert the proposition “A is probably B.” What information does the proposition give us concerning B? [S] 19.

[S] 30. Define Obversion and Inversion, and apply these processes also to the above three propositions. 31. Propositions can be understood either in extension or in intension. Explain this, and discuss the relative value of the two interpretations. [S] 32. Distinguish between real and verbal propositions; and explain the importance of the distinction. 33. Illustrate the process called ‘change of Relation.’ III. SYLLOGISM AND MEDIATE INFERENCE. 34. What is a Syllogism? Find, without reference to the mnemonic verses, in what different ways it is possible to prove syllogistically the conclusion No S is P; and show the equivalence between these different ways. [S] 35. From what points of view can the syllogism be regarded (1) as being, (2) as not being, a petitio principii? [S] 36. What are the figures of syllogism?

Take an apparent syllogism subject to the fallacy of negative premises, and inquire whether you can correct the reasoning by converting one or both of the premises into the affirmative form. [S] 45. Enumerate the faults to which a syllogism is liable, giving instances of each. [S] 46. State any Enthymeme, and expand it into (1) a Syllogism, (2) an Epicheirema, (3) a Sorites; and give in each case the technical name of the Mood or Order that results. 47. State any Disjunctive Syllogism, and change it (1) into a Hypothetical, (2) into a Categorical; and discuss the loss or gain, in cogency or significance involved in this process. 48. Can the Syllogism be treated as merely a consequence of the “Laws of Thought”? If not, why not; and what else does it imply? 49.

If a conclusion reached by deduction does not agree with the facts, where must we look for error? 70. There are certain cases in which failure of verification is fatal to a theory, and other cases in which it is of comparatively little cogency. How would you distinguish between these classes of cases? [S] 71. Taking the “evolution,” or any other proposed hypothesis, how should one proceed (a) to show whether it satisfies the conditions of a legitimate hypothesis sufficiently to entitle it to investigation, and (b) to test it with a view to its acceptance or rejection as a truth of science?

State in syllogistic form (mood and figure) the following arguments:– (a) As polygamy is in many countries legal, we may infer the variability of the moral standard. (b) If gold is wealth, to export it diminishes the national resources. (c) If all good people are happy, unhappiness is an indication of vice. (d) One may be sure of the benefits of inuring young children to cold, from the strength exhibited by all men and women thus treated in infancy. (e) Where there is no law, there is no injustice. (f) “Dissimulation is but a faint kind of policy or wisdom; for it asketh a strong wit and a strong heart to know when to tell the truth, and to do it; therefore it is the weaker sort of politicians that are the greatest dissemblers.” (Bacon.) (g) Money being a barren product, it is contrary to nature to make it reproduce itself. Usury, therefore, is unnatural, and, being unnatural, is unjustifiable. (h) The study of mathematics is essential to a complete course of education, because it induces a habit of close and regular reasoning. [S] 101.

Explain and discuss the following dicta:–(a) Qui nimium probat, nihil probat: (b) A bad proof is worse than no proof; (c) The exception proves the rule; (d) Negatives cannot be proved. [C] 107. Examine how far the rules of immediate and syllogistic inference are modified by differences of interpretation of the categorical proposition in respect of the existence of the subject. [S] 108. “An effect is but the sum of all the partial causes, the concurrence of which constitutes its existence.” “The cause of an event is its invariable and unconditional antecedent.” Explain and compare these two theories of causation. Does either alone exhaust the scientific conception of cause? [S] 109. Under what logical conditions are statistical inferences authorised, and what is the nature of their conclusions? [S] 110. Distinguish between Psychology, Metaphysics, and Logic; and discuss briefly their mutual relations. [S] 111. All processes of inference in which the ultimate premises are particular cases are equally induction. Induction is an inverse deduction.

Distinguish between a working hypothesis and an established hypothesis, so as to bring out the conditions on which the latter depends. [L] 120. Explain how good scientific nomenclature and terminology are connected with the purposes of good classification. [L]
