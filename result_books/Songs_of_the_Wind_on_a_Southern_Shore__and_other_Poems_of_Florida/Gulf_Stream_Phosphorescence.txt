Now night has encompassed the far-fading sea Where her garbing of death smother low. The prow of our ship through the black mystery Unbares the live silver below. In the wake of our way a treasure vein gleams: White cataracts streaming of lights: And cascading jewels of barbaric dreams: Old wealth of Arabian Nights’. And now as I look, star galaxies glow: —Of universe born for a breath;— And constellar systems in wild orbits, go On the instant of birth to their death. And trillion aged planets above me there are: Yet, these phosphorous worlds are a sign That more brief is the span of the longest-lived star, —Compared with mine.
