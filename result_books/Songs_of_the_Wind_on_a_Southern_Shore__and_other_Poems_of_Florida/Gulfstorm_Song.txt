Mother,—to thee! Great gulf-combers rolling: Ghost reef-bells low tolling:— Dark storm-sweeping roar descends around me. Like childish arms clinging, My thoughts now are winging, Mother,—to thee. Mother,—as thine! Old faith, new abounding, Drowns surges’ resounding; —All—must be well if by Master design. ...Faith—greater, recalling,— Through Life-storms befalling,— Mother,—that’s thine.
