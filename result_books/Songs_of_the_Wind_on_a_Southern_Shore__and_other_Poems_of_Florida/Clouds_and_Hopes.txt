The wind sings drear in the pines to-night; And the struggling moon shines dim; Far off—the song of the night-bird’s flight Comes dull as a funeral hymn.— The scuds that fly o’er the gray-lit sky By the moon so dull and sad Are ghostly forms that pass and die As the hopes we once have had. Dark hopeless forms on the night-wind’s wing Passing onward in endless flight. To one afar,—where the skylarks sing, And the dawn in its fresh-born light Is tuning the heart to the merriest lay, And gilding all nature with gold;— These forms now so dull,—’neath the magical day, Who knows but great Promise may hold?
