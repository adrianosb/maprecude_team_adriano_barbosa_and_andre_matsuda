From the treacherous coralline lips   That pant for prey, The life of a thousand ships   They guide alway. On the course of one vessel I know   Shines only—one: Yet the gleam of all others’ may fade or may go;   —Mine, changes none. The glow that it throws finds the near; or the far   Wide wasting through. Your love and your faith its keepers are:   Its light is—You.
