To be born in the sweet tropic spring-time   When honey-steeped breezes sing low; When birds in the oranges mating   ‘Midst their bridal-wreath swing to-and-fro; When even the pine-boughs, each breathing low cheer,   Lover-like bow to the jessamine near, And always—cool voicing from palm-choired ocean   Echo dreamings ‘tis gladness to know. Oh! To be born in this sweet southern spring-time   Is to be heir of its joy; the child of its play; Is to throb to the tune of the sweet-pulsing music   Unloosed from the harp of a South-loving Fay; Is to feel the deep bond of this sensuous Beauty,   The sweet-yielding secrets of tropical May.
