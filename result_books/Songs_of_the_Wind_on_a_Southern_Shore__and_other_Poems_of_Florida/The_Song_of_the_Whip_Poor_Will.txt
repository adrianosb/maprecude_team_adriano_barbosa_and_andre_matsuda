When calm the night, in silv’ry moonlight drown’d, And hushed in folds of deep and dreamless sleep Seem all the world, a plaintive mournful sound Disturbs the silent air, and breaks the deep— And awesome hush with notes of tenor shrill; Quick uttered notes in ceaseless monotone, And filled with the weird sadness the whip-poor-will Unburdens alone, to the kindly moon. Thy song so simple, hath yet a charm That weaves all unconsciously into the spell The moonlight throws around. Thy quick alarm Bears tales of long complaint: that blends in flight With murmured woes that sobbing pin-boughs tell: And, sad, regretful, speaks for list’ning Night.
