There’s a phrase we heard so often In the days not long ago; And the words—as always—soften;— Bring the ache such mem’ries know; I can hear—my father’s saying:— —”When the groves begin to bear!” There’s the rooms of our old cabin: There’s our parents talking slow: And a hush of childish “gabbin,” As we hear so grave and low; “Yes;—we—will”—my father’saying:— “When the groves begin to bear!” In the days when all was labor, From the morn past evening’s sun: Nor the time to even “neighbor;” Not an hour for any fun;— “But we will”—my father’s saying:— —”When the groves begin to bear!” Oh, that brave and hopeful saying! And that kept our hearts alive; When his iron will-pow’r, staying, Only kept us in the drive! Those heart’ning words!—my father’s saying:— —”When the grove begin to bear!” When the freeze and “drown’d—out” got us, Sometimes then, as I recall; There was only one thing brought us Out the dark and hopeless pall;— “Still the trees!”—my father’s saying:— —”When the groves begin to bear!” And the pang to know that after All these hopes—so long deferred:— When came chance for joy and laughter:— He never shared the boons conferred. He was not here to prove his saying:— —When the groves began to bear! Still;—I know that over Yonder— There—the groves are golden:—yet,— —There he sits in hopeful ponder O’er the Trees he also set:— ...I can hear—my father’s saying:— —”When those groves begin to bear!”
