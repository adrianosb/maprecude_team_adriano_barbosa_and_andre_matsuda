Oh come, oh my love! I have found now a place Where old romance dawns ever a—new: Where the Spirit of Love unveils her fair face; And fairies trip over the blue. 'Tis an isle in the seas of Tennyson's dream When he sang of the Eden isles: And the waters surrounding so crystal they seem, As to mirror the heavenly aisles. And listen, my love! As we fly to this isle Where luscious fruits ripen on lustrous tree, We'll sail the Gulf waters for purple—pale mile, —To the bounds of a Parish sea. When we glide through the gates of that velvet bay blue, —Gates, —that like corralline lions brown stand,— In our Parish—white ship, with our fairy—brown crew,— We will beach on that Eden strand. So come, oh my love, to this far—away place Where sweet romance dawns ever a—new! Where the Love of all Ages is seen in the face That Nature here shows unto you.
