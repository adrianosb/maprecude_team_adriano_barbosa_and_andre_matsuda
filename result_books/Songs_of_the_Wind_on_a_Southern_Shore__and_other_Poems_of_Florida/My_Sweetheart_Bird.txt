I have a little sweetheart bird That sings sweet songs to me,... And now I know…what failed me so… When other birds…   Sang songs to me. I had a little blue-clad bird Whose trills were filled with mystery… But while she trilled I felt my bird Was thrilled…   By else but me. And once a fairy yellow bird Beneath the orange tree Sang sprightly strains—(an elfish bird)— and came…   Quite close to me. And long…a saucy red-robed bird Sang sensuous notes in tempting plea. At nights she came so close:...and oft I thought I loved   Her melody. I prized a sober brown-hued bird That sang old songs to me… But she has flown:—and none have known Where e’er…   My bird may be. And there was, too, a tiny bird That always seemed to flee! I closed her ‘round:...and then I found There was…   No fear of me. I spied a wild and pretty bird That warbled chords of glee:... I thought:...no love can capture her:... She always…   Will be free. ...But now—I have a sweetheart bird That stays so close to me. Her message wings:—as low she sings— And she…   Sings but to me. And from her heart my sweetheart bird Lifts sweetest melody. And thus you know…I named her so! She is…   Most sweet to me. I have a little sweetheart bird That sings sweet songs to me. ...And now I know…what failed me so When other birds…   Sang songs to me.
