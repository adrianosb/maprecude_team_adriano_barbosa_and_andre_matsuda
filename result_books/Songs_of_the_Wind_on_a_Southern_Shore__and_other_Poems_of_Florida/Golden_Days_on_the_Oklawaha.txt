One day as I walked through the woodland And along by the banks of the stream, —I surprised—in the depths of the gleam— The Spirit that governs the woodland In the midst of a wonderful dream. So still was the heart of the forest, And so faintly I felt of its breath,   —’Twas hushed as one holding her breath— That I feared in my musings—for lest   —The dream be the dreaming of death. But as the breath of life on a mirror Of one deemed to be passing away,   O’er the stream—as faint flushing of gray— Moved the spirit, ebbing nearer and nearer To its death through the autumn day. And I gained to the heart of its being; E’en the innermost place of its dream:   And as souls in communion may seem The owners of fancies together,—so seeing, I passed midst the golden-hazed gleam. The dream was ablaze of the gladness Of days that were long-ago fled:   Of Spring-time,—of Youth,—and of Hope-led Rosy-tinged fancies,—such, e’er the shadow of sadness Throws over it’s mantle of dread. All aglow with the roseate beaming, And a-flare in the dight of the bold,   All the flames that stirred youth from of old— Were the visions I glimpsed as the dreamings   Were imaged in scarlet and gold. The blood-dyes of the sun-sett of summer;— The purple-blent floods o’er the sea;—   The flash and the riot of flower spread lea— All the heart-glows of the vanshed summer;— Were pictured from memory. The pulsings of departed pleasures; And the achings of inspired pain   As though throbbing in essence again— Seemed blending with the exquisite measures Of a music of longing so vain. An impulse of unknown stirring, Like echoes of prophecy   A shadow of eternity— Seemed to bring o’er the visions a blurring, And the calling of memory;— As whispers are blent in the murmuring Of the fathomless irrepressible sea. So sadly I left Nature a-dreaming There in the golden-hazed gleam;   The joyous—sad wonderful dream— For the visions I had glimpsed held the seeming Of thought deeper that dreamer may dream.
