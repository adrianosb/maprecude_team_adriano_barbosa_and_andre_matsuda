To Eunice Brow eyes of fair Hispania; Black hair of Indie Isle; Inheriting of old Britannia —Not your langourous Latin smile,— But your stubborn wilful spirit,— Your spunky saucy style. Sweet lips—of kisses Elysian:— More fragrant than “Parfume Vantine.” Chic grace—of essence Parisian: Hot temper that most matches mine:— True heart;—filled with love that is precious: Why you are my Valentine!
