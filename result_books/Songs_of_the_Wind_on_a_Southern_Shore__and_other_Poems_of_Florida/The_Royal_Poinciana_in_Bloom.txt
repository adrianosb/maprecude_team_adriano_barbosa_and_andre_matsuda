Scarlet bloom of deepest dye, That with the summer sunset vie In flashful boast, thy thick-massed flame:— Lo! Thou hast put its wealth to shame: For all out-done, the tropic sun Recalls his tint-skilled fays of fire,— Glowing rich in envy as they fly. The blood-red gleam of nonpareil Amidst thy glare is hid so well That none can know ‘tis bowered there With scarlet flash of tanager;— Nor,—faraway, in heat of day— —A crimson stain against the green— From very flame one can’st thee tell. Above thy growth of tender green,— That in thy pride can’st not be seen— The throbbing pulse of flames’ desire Seems urging tongues of crimson higher; —As spray-wove gleams o’er molten streams;— Or combing surges breaking low Upon a sea of fire. The southern land that yields thy store Of matchless wealth;—in days of yore Had envied oft the sunset sky Where tropic summer’s gift days die In glory’s blaze:—And, testing all her ways She found at last thy blood-dyed bloom; —than which the sky can’st do no more!
