When I was young I always dreamed that Life was Long. ...There was a dyke I often climbed:—to hear the song Of Sea;—to feel on my hot cheek its breath blow free —And dream of Life; and things that Were to Be. My spirit roamed so far! To me that View Stretched wide to endless shore. Upon its magic blue I felt my self:...And mine—its wealth of storied song, —And space and time that but to changeless stars belong! Upon that dyke I always dreamed that Life was Long! Flowing swiftly twenty surging Tide-waves go! Southern landscapes mould my being. (Northern visions always seeing— Would they have yielded Larger Living? Who can know!) On Plymouth dyke I always dreamed that Life was Long! And I am grown!—Again I came to view The glowing greens: the magic Blue. ...Two easy steps; and I had climbed the dyke!—And then there lay A scanty shore:—a tiny bay:...not blue—but gray. The self-same dyke where I had dreamed that Life was Long! My heart went faint and shrank in me. My cold cheek, too, THe dry hot wind oppressed:—as did the meager view My sorrowed soul: ... Where of old rode ships of storied song Ebbed now the sere sea-weed… ...And I have now no time to do What I had hoped:— ...When once I dreamed that Life was Long.
