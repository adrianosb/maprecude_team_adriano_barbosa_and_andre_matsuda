Oh, the poets may sing of their Lady Irenes, And may rave in their rhymes about wonderful queens; But I throw my poetical wings to the breeze, And soar in a song to my Lady Louise. A sweet little maid, who is dearer, I ween, Than any fair duchess, or even a queen. When speaking of her I can’t plod in my prose, For she ’s the wee lassie who gave me a rose. Since poets, from seeing a lady’s lip curled, Have written fair verse that has sweetened the world; Why, then, should not I give the space of an hour To making a song in return for a flower? I have found in my life—it has not been so long— There are too few of flowers—too little of song. So out of that blossom, this lay of mine grows, For the dear little lady who gave me the rose. I thank God for innocence, dearer than Art, That lights on a by–way which leads to the heart, And led by an impulse no less than divine, Walks into the temple and sits at the shrine. I would rather pluck daisies that grow in the wild, Or take one simple rose from the hand of a child, Then to breathe the rich fragrance of flowers that bide In the gardens of luxury, passion, and pride. I know not, my wee one, how came you to know Which way to my heart was the right way to go; Unless in your purity, soul–clean and clear, God whispers his messages into your ear. You have now had my song, let me end with a prayer That your life may be always sweet, happy, and fair; That your joys may be many, and absent your woes, O dear little lady who gave me the rose!
