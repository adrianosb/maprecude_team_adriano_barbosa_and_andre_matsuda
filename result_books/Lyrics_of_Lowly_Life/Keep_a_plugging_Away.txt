I ‘ve a humble little motto That is homely, though it ’s true,— Keep a–pluggin’ away. It’s a thing when I ‘ve an object That I always try to do,— Keep a–pluggin’ away. When you ‘ve rising storms to quell, When opposing waters swell, It will never fail to tell,— Keep a–pluggin’ away. If the hills are high before And the paths are hard to climb, Keep a–pluggin’ away. And remember that successes Come to him who bides his time,— Keep a–pluggin’ away. From the greatest to the least, None are from the rule released. Be thou toiler, poet, priest, Keep a–pluggin’ away. Delve away beneath the surface, There is treasure farther down,— Keep a–pluggin’ away. Let the rain come down in torrents, Let the threat’ning heavens frown, Keep a–pluggin’ away. When the clouds have rolled away, There will come a brighter day All your labor to repay,— Keep a–pluggin’ away. There ‘ll be lots of sneers to swallow, There ‘ll be lots of pain to bear,— Keep a–pluggin’ away. If you ‘ve got your eye on heaven, Some bright day you ‘ll wake up there,— Keep a–pluggin’ away. Perseverance still is king; Time its sure reward will bring; Work and wait unwearying,— Keep a–pluggin’ away.
