Why fades a dream? An iridescent ray Flecked in between the tryst Of night and day. Why fades a dream?— Of consciousness the shade Wrought out by lack of light and made Upon life’s stream. Why fades a dream? That thought may thrive, So fades the fleshless dream; Lest men should learn to trust The things that seem. So fades a dream, That living thought may grow And like a waxing star–beam glow Upon life’s stream— So fades a dream.
