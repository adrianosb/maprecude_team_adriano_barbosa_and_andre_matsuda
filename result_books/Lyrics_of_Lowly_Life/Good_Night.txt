The lark is silent in his nest, The breeze is sighing in its flight, Sleep, Love, and peaceful be thy rest. Good–night, my love, good–night, good–night. Sweet dreams attend thee in thy sleep, To soothe thy rest till morning’s light, And angels round thee vigil keep. Good–night, my love, good–night, good–night. Sleep well, my love, on night’s dark breast, And ease thy soul with slumber bright; Be joy but thine and I am blest. Good–night, my love, good–night, good–night.
