My soul, lost in the music’s mist, Roamed, rapt, ‘neath skies of amethyst. The cheerless streets grew summer meads, The Son of Phoebus spurred his steeds, And, wand’ring down the mazy tune, December lost its way in June, While from a verdant vale I heard The piping of a love–lorn bird. A something in the tender strain Revived an old, long–conquered pain, And as in depths of many seas, My heart was drowned in memories. The tears came welling to my eyes, Nor could I ask it otherwise; For, oh! a sweetness seems to last Amid the dregs of sorrows past. It stirred a chord that here of late I ‘d grown to think could not vibrate. It brought me back the trust of youth, The world again was joy and truth. And Avice, blooming like a bride, Once more stood trusting at my side. But still, with bosom desolate, The lorn bird sang to find his mate. Then there are trees, and lights and stars, The silv’ry tinkle of guitars; And throbs again as throbbed that waltz, Before I knew that hearts were false. Then like a cold wave on a shore, Comes silence and she sings no more. I wake, I breathe, I think again, And walk the sordid ways of men.
