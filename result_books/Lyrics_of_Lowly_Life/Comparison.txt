The sky of brightest gray seems dark To one whose sky was ever white. To one who never knew a spark, Thro’ all his life, of love or light, The grayest cloud seems over–bright. The robin sounds a beggar’s note Where one the nightingale has heard, But he for whom no silver throat Its liquid music ever stirred, Deems robin still the sweetest bird.
