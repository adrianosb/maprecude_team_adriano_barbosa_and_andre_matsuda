“Good–bye,” I said to my conscience— “Good–bye for aye and aye,” And I put her hands off harshly, And turned my face away; And conscience smitten sorely Returned not from that day. But a time came when my spirit Grew weary of its pace; And I cried: “Come back, my conscience; I long to see thy face.” But conscience cried: “I cannot; Remorse sits in my place.”
