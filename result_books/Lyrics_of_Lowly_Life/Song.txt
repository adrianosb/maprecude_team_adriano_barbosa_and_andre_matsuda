My heart to thy heart, My hand to thine; My lip to thy lips, Kisses are wine Brewed for the lover in sunshine and shade; Let me drink deep, then, my African maid. Lily to lily, Rose unto rose; My love to thy love Tenderly grows. Rend not the oak and the ivy in twain, Nor the swart maid from her swarthier swain.
