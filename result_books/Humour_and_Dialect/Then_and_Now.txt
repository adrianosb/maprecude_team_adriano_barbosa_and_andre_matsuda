THEN He loved her, and through many years, Had paid his fair devoted court, Until she wearied, and with sneers Turned all his ardent love to sport. That night within his chamber lone, He long sat writing by his bed A note in which his heart made moan For love; the morning found him dead. NOW Like him, a man of later day Was jilted by the maid he sought, And from her presence turned away, Consumed by burning, bitter thought. He sought his room to writeâ€”a curse Like him before and die, I ween. Ah no, he put his woes in verse, And sold them to a magazine.
