BOOK VI. THE METHOD OF SUBSCRIPTS. CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTORY. Let us agree that “x1” shall mean “Some existing Things have the Attribute x”, i.e. (more briefly) “Some x exist”; also that “xy1” shall mean “Some xy exist”, and so on. Such a Proposition may be called an ‘Entity.’ [Note that, when there are two letters in the expression, it does not in the least matter which stands first: “xy1” and “yx1” mean exactly the same.] Also that “x0” shall mean “No existing Things have the Attribute x”. i.e. (more briefly) “No x exist”; also that “xy0” shall mean “No xy exist”, and so on. Such a Pro- position may be called a ‘Nullity’. Also that ”Ü” shall mean “and”. [Thus “ab1 Ü cd0” means “Some ab exist and no cd exist”.] Also that ”∂” shall mean “would, if true, prove”. [Thus, “x0 ∂ xy0” means “The Proposition ‘No x exist’ would, if true, prove Proposition ‘No xy exist’”.] When two letters are both of them accented, or both not accented, they are said to have ‘Like Signs’, or to be ‘Like’: when one is accented, and the other not, they are said to have ‘Unlike Signs’, or to be ‘Unlike’.
