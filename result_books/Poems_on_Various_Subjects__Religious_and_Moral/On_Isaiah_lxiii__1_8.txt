SAY, heav'nly muse, what king or mighty God, That moves sublime from Idumea's road? In Bosrah's dies, with martial glories join'd, His purple vesture waves upon the wind. Why thus enrob'd delights he to appear In the dread image of the Pow'r of war? Compres'd in wrath the swelling wineâ€“press groan'd, It bled, and pour'd the gushing purple round. "Mine was the act," th' Almighty Saviour said, And shook the dazzling glories of his head, "When all forsook I trod the press alone, "And conquer'd by omnipotence my own; "For man's release sustain'd the pond'rous load, "For man the wrath of an immortal God: "To execute th' Eternal's dread command "My soul I sacrific'd with willing hand; "Sinless I stood before the avenging frown, "Atoning thus for vices not my own." His eye the ample field of battle round Survey'd, but no created succours found; His own omnipotence sustain'd the right, His vengeance sunk the haughty foes in night; Beneath his feet the prostrate troops were spread, And round him lay the dying, and the dead. Great God, what light'ning flashes from thine eyes? What pow'r withstands if thou indignant rise? Against thy Zion though her foes may rage, And all their cunning, all their strength engage, Yet she serenely on thy bosom lies, Smiles at their arts, and all their force defies.
