A BIRD delicious to the taste, On which an army once did feast, Sent by an hand unseen; A creature of the horned race, Which Britain's royal standards grace; A gem of vivid green; II. A town of gaiety and sport, Where beaux and beauteous nymphs resort, And gallantry doth reign; A Dardan hero fam'd of old For youth and beauty, as we're told, And by a monarch slain; III. A peer of popular applause, Who doth our violated laws, And grievances proclaim. Th' initials show a vanquish'd town, That adds fresh glory and renown To old Britannia's fame.
