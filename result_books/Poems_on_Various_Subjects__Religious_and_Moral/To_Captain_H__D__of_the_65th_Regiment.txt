SAY, muse divine, can hostile scenes delight The warrior's bosom in the fields of fight? Lo! here the christian and the hero join With mutual grace to form the man divine. In H–––––D see with pleasure and surprise, Where valour kindles, and where virtue lies: Go, hero brave, still grace the post of fame, And add new glories to thine honour'd name, Still to the field, and still to virtue true: Britannia glories in no son like you.
