The sand–man he’s a jolly old fellow, His face is kind and his voice is mellow, But he makes your eyelids as heavy as lead, And then you got to go off to bed; I don’t think I like the sand–man. But I’ve been playing this livelong day; It does make a fellow so tired to play! Oh, my, I’m a–yawning right here before ma, I’m the sleepiest fellow that ever you saw. I think I do like the sand–man.
