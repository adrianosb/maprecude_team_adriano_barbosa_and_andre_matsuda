Dolly sits a–quilting by her mother, stitch by stitch, Gracious, how my pulses throb, how my fingers itch, While I note her dainty waist and her slender hand, As she matches this and that, she stitches strand by strand. And I long to tell her Life’s a quilt and I’m a patch; Love will do the stitching if she’ll only be my match.
