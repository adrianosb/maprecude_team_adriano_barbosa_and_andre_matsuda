Tell your love where the roses blow, And the hearts of the lilies quiver, Not in the city’s gleam and glow, But down by a half–sunned river. Not in the crowded ball–room’s glare, That would be fatal, Marie, Marie, How can she answer you then and there? So come then and stroll with me, my dear, Down where the birds call, Marie, Marie.
