I’ve always been a faithful man An’ tried to live for duty, But the stringent mode of life Has somewhat lost its beauty. The story of the generous bread He sent upon the waters, Which after many days returns To trusting sons and daughters, Had oft impressed me, so I want My soul influenced by it, And bought a loaf of bread and sought A stream where I could try it. I cast my bread upon the waves And fancied then to await it; It had not floated far away When a fish came up and ate it. And if I want both fish and bread, And surely both I’m wanting, About the only way I see Is for me to go fishing.
