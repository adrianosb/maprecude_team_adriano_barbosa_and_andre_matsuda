Your spoken words are roses fine and sweet, The songs you sing are perfect pearls of sound. How lavish nature is about your feet, To scatter flowers and jewels both around. Blushing the stream of petal beauty flows, Softly the white strings trickle down and shine. Oh! speak to me, my love, I crave a rose. Sing me a song, for I would pearls were mine.
