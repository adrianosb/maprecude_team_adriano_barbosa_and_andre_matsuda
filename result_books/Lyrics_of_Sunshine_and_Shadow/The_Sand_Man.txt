I know a man With face of tan, But who is ever kind; Whom girls and boys Leaves games and toys Each eventide to find. When day grows dim, They watch for him, He comes to place his claim; He wears the crown Of Dreaming–town; The sand–man is his name. When sparkling eyes Troop sleepywise And busy lips grow dumb; When little heads Nod toward the beds, We know the sand–man’s come.
