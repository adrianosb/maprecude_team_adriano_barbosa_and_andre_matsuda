Oh the breeze is blowin’ balmy An the sun is in a haze; There’s a cloud jest givin’ coolness To the laziest of days. There are crowds upon the lakeside, But the fish refuse to bite, So I’ll wait and go a–fishin’ When the wind gets right. Now my boat tugs at her anchor, Eager now to kiss the spray, While the little waves are callin’ Drowsy sailor come away, There’s a harbor for the happy, And its sheen is just in sight, But I won’t set sail to get there, Till the wind gets right. That’s my trouble, too, I reckon, I’ve been waitin’ all too long, Tho’ the days were always Still the wind is always wrong. An’ when Gabriel blows his trumpet, In the day o’ in the night, I will still be found waitin’, Till the wind gets right.
