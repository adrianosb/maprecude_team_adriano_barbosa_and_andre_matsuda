Yesterday I held your hand, Reverently I pressed it, And its gentle yieldingness From my soul I blessed it. But to–day I sit alone, Sad and sore repining; Must our gold forever know Flames for the refining? Yesterday I walked with you, Could a day be sweeter? Life was all a lyric song Set to tricksy meter. Ah, to–day is like a dirge,— Place my arms around you, Let me feel the same dear joy As when first I found you. Let me once retrace my steps, From these roads unpleasant, Let my heart and mind and soul All ignore the present. Yesterday the iron seared And to–day means sorrow. Pause, my soul, arise, arise, Look where gleams the morrow.
