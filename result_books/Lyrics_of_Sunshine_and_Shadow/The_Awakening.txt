I did not know that life could be so sweet, I did not know the hours could speed so fleet, Till I knew you, and life was sweet again. The days grew brief with love and lack of painâ€” I was a slave a few short days ago, The powers of Kings and Princes now I know; I would not be again in bondage, save I had your smile, the liberty I crave.
