                <p>
	Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing,<br />
	Beloved from pole to pole!<br />
	To Mary Queen the praise be given!<br />
	She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,<br />
	That slid into my soul.</p>
<p>
	The silly buckets on the deck,<br />
	That had so long remained,<br />
	I dreamt that they were filled with dew;<br />
	And when I awoke, it rained.</p>
<p>
	My lips were wet, my throat was cold,<br />
	My garments all were dank;<br />
	Sure I had drunken in my dreams,<br />
	And still my body drank.</p>
<p>
	I moved, and could not feel my limbs:<br />
	I was so light&mdash;almost<br />
	I thought that I had died in sleep,<br />
	And was a blessed ghost.</p>
<p>
	And soon I heard a roaring wind:<br />
	It did not come anear;<br />
	But with its sound it shook the sails,<br />
	That were so thin and sere.</p>
<p>
	The upper air burst into life!<br />
	And a hundred fire-flags sheen,<br />
	To and fro they were hurried about!<br />
	And to and fro, and in and out,<br />
	The wan stars danced between.</p>
<p>
	And the coming wind did roar more loud,<br />
	And the sails did sigh like sedge;<br />
	And the rain poured down from one black cloud;<br />
	The Moon was at its edge.</p>
<p>
	The thick black cloud was cleft, and still<br />
	The Moon was at its side:<br />
	Like waters shot from some high crag,<br />
	The lightning fell with never a jag,<br />
	A river steep and wide.</p>
<p>
	The loud wind never reached the ship,<br />
	Yet now the ship moved on!<br />
	Beneath the lightning and the Moon<br />
	The dead men gave a groan.</p>
<p>
	They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,<br />
	Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;<br />
	It had been strange, even in a dream,<br />
	To have seen those dead men rise.</p>
<p>
	The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;<br />
	Yet never a breeze up blew;<br />
	The mariners all &#39;gan work the ropes,<br />
	Where they were wont to do:<br />
	They raised their limbs like lifeless tools&mdash;<br />
	We were a ghastly crew.</p>
<p>
	The body of my brother&#39;s son,<br />
	Stood by me, knee to knee:<br />
	The body and I pulled at one rope,<br />
	But he said nought to me.</p>
<p>
	&quot;I fear thee, ancient Mariner!&quot;<br />
	Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest!<br />
	&#39;Twas not those souls that fled in pain,<br />
	Which to their corses came again,<br />
	But a troop of spirits blest:</p>
<p>
	For when it dawned&mdash;they dropped their arms,<br />
	And clustered round the mast;<br />
	Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,<br />
	And from their bodies passed.</p>
<p>
	Around, around, flew each sweet sound,<br />
	Then darted to the Sun;<br />
	Slowly the sounds came back again,<br />
	Now mixed, now one by one.</p>
<p>
	Sometimes a-dropping from the sky<br />
	I heard the sky-lark sing;<br />
	Sometimes all little birds that are,<br />
	How they seemed to fill the sea and air<br />
	With their sweet jargoning!</p>
<p>
	And now &#39;twas like all instruments,<br />
	Now like a lonely flute;<br />
	And now it is an angel&#39;s song,<br />
	That makes the Heavens be mute.</p>
<p>
	It ceased; yet still the sails made on<br />
	A pleasant noise till noon,<br />
	A noise like of a hidden brook<br />
	In the leafy month of June,<br />
	That to the sleeping woods all night<br />
	Singeth a quiet tune.</p>
<p>
	Till noon we quietly sailed on,<br />
	Yet never a breeze did breathe:<br />
	Slowly and smoothly went the ship,<br />
	Moved onward from beneath.</p>
<p>
	Under the keel nine fathom deep,<br />
	From the land of mist and snow,<br />
	The spirit slid: and it was he<br />
	That made the ship to go.<br />
	The sails at noon left off their tune,<br />
	And the ship stood still also.</p>
<p>
	The Sun, right up above the mast,<br />
	Had fixed her to the ocean:<br />
	But in a minute she &#39;gan stir,<br />
	With a short uneasy motion&mdash;<br />
	Backwards and forwards half her length<br />
	With a short uneasy motion.</p>
<p>
	Then like a pawing horse let go,<br />
	She made a sudden bound:<br />
	It flung the blood into my head,<br />
	And I fell down in a swound.</p>
<p>
	How long in that same fit I lay,<br />
	I have not to declare;<br />
	But ere my living life returned,<br />
	I heard and in my soul discerned<br />
	Two VOICES in the air.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Is it he?&quot; quoth one, &quot;Is this the man?<br />
	By him who died on cross,<br />
	With his cruel bow he laid full low,<br />
	The harmless Albatross.</p>
<p>
	&quot;The spirit who bideth by himself<br />
	In the land of mist and snow,<br />
	He loved the bird that loved the man<br />
	Who shot him with his bow.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The other was a softer voice,<br />
	As soft as honey-dew:<br />
	Quoth he, &quot;The man hath penance done,<br />
	And penance more will do.&quot;</p>
