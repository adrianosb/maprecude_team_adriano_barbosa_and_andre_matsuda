	<em>Aesop&#39;s Fables</em> is a collection of tales by the Greek storyteller Aesop. Most of the tales included here were translated and edited by Reverend George Fyler Townsend (1814-1900) in England and published under the title, <em>Aesop&#39;s Fables</em>. Townsend&#39;s translations were influential on many subsequent collections of fables. Some of the tales included here were taken from the book&nbsp;<em>How to Tell Stories to Children and Some Stories To Tell</em>, by Sara Cone Bryant and published in London in 1918. In some cases, we have included both Townsend&#39;s version and Bryant&#39;s version of the same tale.</p>    </p>
