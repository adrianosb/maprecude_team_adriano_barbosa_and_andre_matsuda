                <p>
	TOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt said to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising market:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Tom, I&#39;ve a notion to skin you alive!&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Auntie, what have I done?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Well, you&#39;ve done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old softy, expecting I&#39;m going to make her believe all that rubbage about that dream, when lo and behold you she&#39;d found out from Joe that you was over here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don&#39;t know what is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool of myself and never say a word.&quot;</p>
<p>
	This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked mean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to say for a moment. Then he said:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Auntie, I wish I hadn&#39;t done it&mdash;but I didn&#39;t think.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your own selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from Jackson&#39;s Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn&#39;t ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn&#39;t mean to be mean. I didn&#39;t, honest. And besides, I didn&#39;t come over here to laugh at you that night.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;What did you come for, then?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn&#39;t got drownded.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never did&mdash;and I know it, Tom.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Indeed and &#39;deed I did, auntie&mdash;I wish I may never stir if I didn&#39;t.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Oh, Tom, don&#39;t lie&mdash;don&#39;t do it. It only makes things a hundred times worse.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;It ain&#39;t a lie, auntie; it&#39;s the truth. I wanted to keep you from grieving&mdash;that was all that made me come.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I&#39;d give the whole world to believe that&mdash;it would cover up a power of sins, Tom. I&#39;d &#39;most be glad you&#39;d run off and acted so bad. But it ain&#39;t reasonable; because, why didn&#39;t you tell me, child?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn&#39;t somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and kept mum.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;What bark?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;The bark I had wrote on to tell you we&#39;d gone pirating. I wish, now, you&#39;d waked up when I kissed you&mdash;I do, honest.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The hard lines in his aunt&#39;s face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned in her eyes.</p>
<p>
	&quot;DID you kiss me, Tom?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Why, yes, I did.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Are you sure you did, Tom?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Why, yes, I did, auntie&mdash;certain sure.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;What did you kiss me for, Tom?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in her voice when she said:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Kiss me again, Tom!&mdash;and be off with you to school, now, and don&#39;t bother me any more.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a jacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her hand, and said to herself:</p>
<p>
	&quot;No, I don&#39;t dare. Poor boy, I reckon he&#39;s lied about it&mdash;but it&#39;s a blessed, blessed lie, there&#39;s such a comfort come from it. I hope the Lord&mdash;I KNOW the Lord will forgive him, because it was such goodheartedness in him to tell it. But I don&#39;t want to find out it&#39;s a lie. I won&#39;t look.&quot;</p>
<p>
	She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out her hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once more she ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the thought: &quot;It&#39;s a good lie&mdash;it&#39;s a good lie&mdash;I won&#39;t let it grieve me.&quot; So she sought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom&#39;s piece of bark through flowing tears and saying: &quot;I could forgive the boy, now, if he&#39;d committed a million sins!&quot;</p>
