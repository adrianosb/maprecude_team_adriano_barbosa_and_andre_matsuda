                <p>
	I was sold to a corn dealer and baker, whom Jerry knew, and with him he thought I should have good food and fair work. In the first he was quite right, and if my master had always been on the premises I do not think I should have been overloaded, but there was a foreman who was always hurrying and driving every one, and frequently when I had quite a full load he would order something else to be taken on. My carter, whose name was Jakes, often said it was more than I ought to take, but the other always overruled him. &quot;&#39;Twas no use going twice when once would do, and he chose to get business forward.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Jakes, like the other carters, always had the check-rein up, which prevented me from drawing easily, and by the time I had been there three or four months I found the work telling very much on my strength.</p>
<p>
	One day I was loaded more than usual, and part of the road was a steep uphill. I used all my strength, but I could not get on, and was obliged continually to stop. This did not please my driver, and he laid his whip on badly. &quot;Get on, you lazy fellow,&quot; he said, &quot;or I&#39;ll make you.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Again I started the heavy load, and struggled on a few yards; again the whip came down, and again I struggled forward. The pain of that great cart whip was sharp, but my mind was hurt quite as much as my poor sides. To be punished and abused when I was doing my very best was so hard it took the heart out of me. A third time he was flogging me cruelly, when a lady stepped quickly up to him, and said in a sweet, earnest voice:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Oh! pray do not whip your good horse any more; I am sure he is doing all he can, and the road is very steep; I am sure he is doing his best.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;If doing his best won&#39;t get this load up he must do something more than his best; that&#39;s all I know, ma&#39;am,&quot; said Jakes.</p>
<p>
	&quot;But is it not a heavy load?&quot; she said.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Yes, yes, too heavy,&quot; he said; &quot;but that&#39;s not my fault; the foreman came just as we were starting, and would have three hundredweight more put on to save him trouble, and I must get on with it as well as I can.&quot;</p>
<p>
	He was raising the whip again, when the lady said:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Pray, stop; I think I can help you if you will let me.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The man laughed.</p>
<p>
	&quot;You see,&quot; she said, &quot;you do not give him a fair chance; he cannot use all his power with his head held back as it is with that check-rein; if you would take it off I am sure he would do better&mdash;do try it,&quot; she said persuasively, &quot;I should be very glad if you would.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Well, well,&quot; said Jakes, with a short laugh, &quot;anything to please a lady, of course. How far would you wish it down, ma&#39;am?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Quite down, give him his head altogether.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The rein was taken off, and in a moment I put my head down to my very knees. What a comfort it was! Then I tossed it up and down several times to get the aching stiffness out of my neck.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Poor fellow! that is what you wanted,&quot; said she, patting and stroking me with her gentle hand; &quot;and now if you will speak kindly to him and lead him on I believe he will be able to do better.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Jakes took the rein. &quot;Come on, Blackie.&quot; I put down my head, and threw my whole weight against the collar; I spared no strength; the load moved on, and I pulled it steadily up the hill, and then stopped to take breath.</p>
<p>
	The lady had walked along the footpath, and now came across into the road. She stroked and patted my neck, as I had not been patted for many a long day.</p>
<p>
	&quot;You see he was quite willing when you gave him the chance; I am sure he is a fine-tempered creature, and I dare say has known better days. You won&#39;t put that rein on again, will you?&quot; for he was just going to hitch it up on the old plan.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Well, ma&#39;am, I can&#39;t deny that having his head has helped him up the hill, and I&#39;ll remember it another time, and thank you, ma&#39;am; but if he went without a check-rein I should be the laughing-stock of all the carters; it is the fashion, you see.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Is it not better,&quot; she said, &quot;to lead a good fashion than to follow a bad one? A great many gentlemen do not use check-reins now; our carriage horses have not worn them for fifteen years, and work with much less fatigue than those who have them; besides,&quot; she added in a very serious voice, &quot;we have no right to distress any of God&#39;s creatures without a very good reason; we call them dumb animals, and so they are, for they cannot tell us how they feel, but they do not suffer less because they have no words. But I must not detain you now; I thank you for trying my plan with your good horse, and I am sure you will find it far better than the whip. Good-day,&quot; and with another soft pat on my neck she stepped lightly across the path, and I saw her no more.</p>
<p>
	&quot;That was a real lady, I&#39;ll be bound for it,&quot; said Jakes to himself; &quot;she spoke just as polite as if I was a gentleman, and I&#39;ll try her plan, uphill, at any rate;&quot; and I must do him the justice to say that he let my rein out several holes, and going uphill after that, he always gave me my head; but the heavy loads went on. Good feed and fair rest will keep up one&#39;s strength under full work, but no horse can stand against overloading; and I was getting so thoroughly pulled down from this cause that a younger horse was bought in my place. I may as well mention here what I suffered at this time from another cause. I had heard horses speak of it, but had never myself had experience of the evil; this was a badly-lighted stable; there was only one very small window at the end, and the consequence was that the stalls were almost dark.</p>
<p>
	Besides the depressing effect this had on my spirits, it very much weakened my sight, and when I was suddenly brought out of the darkness into the glare of daylight it was very painful to my eyes. Several times I stumbled over the threshold, and could scarcely see where I was going.</p>
<p>
	I believe, had I stayed there very long, I should have become purblind, and that would have been a great misfortune, for I have heard men say that a stone-blind horse was safer to drive than one which had imperfect sight, as it generally makes them very timid. However, I escaped without any permanent injury to my sight, and was sold to a large cab owner.</p>
