	SCENE. England. Before the King&#39;s palace.</p>
<p>
	(Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF)</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there<br />
	Weep our sad bosoms empty.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	Let us rather<br />
	Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men<br />
	Bestride our down-fall&#39;n birthdom: each new morn<br />
	New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows<br />
	Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds<br />
	As if it felt with Scotland and yell&#39;d out<br />
	Like syllable of dolour.</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	What I believe I&#39;ll wail,<br />
	What know believe, and what I can redress,<br />
	As I shall find the time to friend, I will.<br />
	What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.<br />
	This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,<br />
	Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.<br />
	He hath not touch&#39;d you yet. I am young;<br />
	but something<br />
	You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom<br />
	To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb<br />
	To appease an angry god.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	I am not treacherous.</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	But Macbeth is.<br />
	A good and virtuous nature may recoil<br />
	In an imperial charge. But I shall crave<br />
	your pardon;<br />
	That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:<br />
	Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;<br />
	Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,<br />
	Yet grace must still look so.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	I have lost my hopes.</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.<br />
	Why in that rawness left you wife and child,<br />
	Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,<br />
	Without leave-taking? I pray you,<br />
	Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,<br />
	But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,<br />
	Whatever I shall think.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	Bleed, bleed, poor country!<br />
	Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,<br />
	For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou thy wrongs;<br />
	The title is affeer&#39;d! Fare thee well, lord:<br />
	I would not be the villain that thou think&#39;st<br />
	For the whole space that&#39;s in the tyrant&#39;s grasp,<br />
	And the rich East to boot.</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	Be not offended:<br />
	I speak not as in absolute fear of you.<br />
	I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;<br />
	It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash<br />
	Is added to her wounds: I think withal<br />
	There would be hands uplifted in my right;<br />
	And here from gracious England have I offer<br />
	Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,<br />
	When I shall tread upon the tyrant&#39;s head,<br />
	Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country<br />
	Shall have more vices than it had before,<br />
	More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,<br />
	By him that shall succeed.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	What should he be?</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	It is myself I mean: in whom I know<br />
	All the particulars of vice so grafted<br />
	That, when they shall be open&#39;d, black Macbeth<br />
	Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state<br />
	Esteem him as a lamb, being compared<br />
	With my confineless harms.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	Not in the legions<br />
	Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn&#39;d<br />
	In evils to top Macbeth.</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	I grant him bloody,<br />
	Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,<br />
	Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin<br />
	That has a name: but there&#39;s no bottom, none,<br />
	In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,<br />
	Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up<br />
	The cistern of my lust, and my desire<br />
	All continent impediments would o&#39;erbear<br />
	That did oppose my will: better Macbeth<br />
	Than such an one to reign.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	Boundless intemperance<br />
	In nature is a tyranny; it hath been<br />
	The untimely emptying of the happy throne<br />
	And fall of many kings. But fear not yet<br />
	To take upon you what is yours: you may<br />
	Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,<br />
	And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.<br />
	We have willing dames enough: there cannot be<br />
	That vulture in you, to devour so many<br />
	As will to greatness dedicate themselves,<br />
	Finding it so inclined.</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	With this there grows<br />
	In my most ill-composed affection such<br />
	A stanchless avarice that, were I king,<br />
	I should cut off the nobles for their lands,<br />
	Desire his jewels and this other&#39;s house:<br />
	And my more-having would be as a sauce<br />
	To make me hunger more; that I should forge<br />
	Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,<br />
	Destroying them for wealth.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	This avarice<br />
	Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root<br />
	Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been<br />
	The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;<br />
	Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.<br />
	Of your mere own: all these are portable,<br />
	With other graces weigh&#39;d.</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	But I have none: the king-becoming graces,<br />
	As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,<br />
	Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,<br />
	Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,<br />
	I have no relish of them, but abound<br />
	In the division of each several crime,<br />
	Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should<br />
	Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,<br />
	Uproar the universal peace, confound<br />
	All unity on earth.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	O Scotland, Scotland!</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	If such a one be fit to govern, speak:<br />
	I am as I have spoken.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	Fit to govern!<br />
	No, not to live. O nation miserable,<br />
	With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter&#39;d,<br />
	When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,<br />
	Since that the truest issue of thy throne<br />
	By his own interdiction stands accursed,<br />
	And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father<br />
	Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,<br />
	Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,<br />
	Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!<br />
	These evils thou repeat&#39;st upon thyself<br />
	Have banish&#39;d me from Scotland. O my breast,<br />
	Thy hope ends here!</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	Macduff, this noble passion,<br />
	Child of integrity, hath from my soul<br />
	Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts<br />
	To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth<br />
	By many of these trains hath sought to win me<br />
	Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me<br />
	From over-credulous haste: but God above<br />
	Deal between thee and me! for even now<br />
	I put myself to thy direction, and<br />
	Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure<br />
	The taints and blames I laid upon myself,<br />
	For strangers to my nature. I am yet<br />
	Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,<br />
	Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,<br />
	At no time broke my faith, would not betray<br />
	The devil to his fellow and delight<br />
	No less in truth than life: my first false speaking<br />
	Was this upon myself: what I am truly,<br />
	Is thine and my poor country&#39;s to command:<br />
	Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,<br />
	Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,<br />
	Already at a point, was setting forth.<br />
	Now we&#39;ll together; and the chance of goodness<br />
	Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	Such welcome and unwelcome things at once<br />
	&#39;Tis hard to reconcile.</p>
<p>
	(Enter a Doctor)</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	Well; more anon.&mdash;Comes the king forth, I pray you?</p>
<p>
	Doctor<br />
	Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls<br />
	That stay his cure: their malady convinces<br />
	The great assay of art; but at his touch&mdash;<br />
	Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand&mdash;<br />
	They presently amend.</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	I thank you, doctor.</p>
<p>
	(Exit Doctor)</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	What&#39;s the disease he means?</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	&#39;Tis call&#39;d the evil:<br />
	A most miraculous work in this good king;<br />
	Which often, since my here-remain in England,<br />
	I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,<br />
	Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,<br />
	All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,<br />
	The mere despair of surgery, he cures,<br />
	Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,<br />
	Put on with holy prayers: and &#39;tis spoken,<br />
	To the succeeding royalty he leaves<br />
	The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,<br />
	He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,<br />
	And sundry blessings hang about his throne,<br />
	That speak him full of grace.</p>
<p>
	(Enter ROSS)</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	See, who comes here?</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	My countryman; but yet I know him not.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	I know him now. Good God, betimes remove<br />
	The means that makes us strangers!</p>
<p>
	ROSS<br />
	Sir, amen.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	Stands Scotland where it did?</p>
<p>
	ROSS<br />
	Alas, poor country!<br />
	Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot<br />
	Be call&#39;d our mother, but our grave; where nothing,<br />
	But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;<br />
	Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air<br />
	Are made, not mark&#39;d; where violent sorrow seems<br />
	A modern ecstasy; the dead man&#39;s knell<br />
	Is there scarce ask&#39;d for who; and good men&#39;s lives<br />
	Expire before the flowers in their caps,<br />
	Dying or ere they sicken.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	O, relation<br />
	Too nice, and yet too true!</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	What&#39;s the newest grief?</p>
<p>
	ROSS<br />
	That of an hour&#39;s age doth hiss the speaker:<br />
	Each minute teems a new one.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	How does my wife?</p>
<p>
	ROSS<br />
	Why, well.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	And all my children?</p>
<p>
	ROSS<br />
	Well too.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	The tyrant has not batter&#39;d at their peace?</p>
<p>
	ROSS<br />
	No; they were well at peace when I did leave &#39;em.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	But not a niggard of your speech: how goes&#39;t?</p>
<p>
	ROSS<br />
	When I came hither to transport the tidings,<br />
	Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour<br />
	Of many worthy fellows that were out;<br />
	Which was to my belief witness&#39;d the rather,<br />
	For that I saw the tyrant&#39;s power a-foot:<br />
	Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland<br />
	Would create soldiers, make our women fight,<br />
	To doff their dire distresses.</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	Be&#39;t their comfort<br />
	We are coming thither: gracious England hath<br />
	Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;<br />
	An older and a better soldier none<br />
	That Christendom gives out.</p>
<p>
	ROSS<br />
	Would I could answer<br />
	This comfort with the like! But I have words<br />
	That would be howl&#39;d out in the desert air,<br />
	Where hearing should not latch them.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	What concern they?<br />
	The general cause? or is it a fee-grief<br />
	Due to some single breast?</p>
<p>
	ROSS<br />
	No mind that&#39;s honest<br />
	But in it shares some woe; though the main part<br />
	Pertains to you alone.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	If it be mine,<br />
	Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.</p>
<p>
	ROSS<br />
	Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,<br />
	Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound<br />
	That ever yet they heard.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	Hum! I guess at it.</p>
<p>
	ROSS<br />
	Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes<br />
	Savagely slaughter&#39;d: to relate the manner,<br />
	Were, on the quarry of these murder&#39;d deer,<br />
	To add the death of you.</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	Merciful heaven!<br />
	What, man! ne&#39;er pull your hat upon your brows;<br />
	Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak<br />
	Whispers the o&#39;er-fraught heart and bids it break.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	My children too?</p>
<p>
	ROSS<br />
	Wife, children, servants, all<br />
	That could be found.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	And I must be from thence!<br />
	My wife kill&#39;d too?</p>
<p>
	ROSS<br />
	I have said.</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	Be comforted:<br />
	Let&#39;s make us medicines of our great revenge,<br />
	To cure this deadly grief.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	He has no children. All my pretty ones?<br />
	Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?<br />
	What, all my pretty chickens and their dam<br />
	At one fell swoop?</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	Dispute it like a man.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	I shall do so;<br />
	But I must also feel it as a man:<br />
	I cannot but remember such things were,<br />
	That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,<br />
	And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,<br />
	They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,<br />
	Not for their own demerits, but for mine,<br />
	Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief<br />
	Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.</p>
<p>
	MACDUFF<br />
	O, I could play the woman with mine eyes<br />
	And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,<br />
	Cut short all intermission; front to front<br />
	Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;<br />
	Within my sword&#39;s length set him; if he &#39;scape,<br />
	Heaven forgive him too!</p>
<p>
	MALCOLM<br />
	This tune goes manly.<br />
	Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;<br />
	Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth<br />
	Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above<br />
	Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:<br />
	The night is long that never finds the day.</p>
