	SCENE. Forres. The palace.</p>
<p>
	(Enter BANQUO)</p>
<p>
	BANQUO<br />
	Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,<br />
	As the weird women promised, and, I fear,<br />
	Thou play&#39;dst most foully for&#39;t: yet it was said<br />
	It should not stand in thy posterity,<br />
	But that myself should be the root and father<br />
	Of many kings. If there come truth from them&mdash;<br />
	As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine&mdash;<br />
	Why, by the verities on thee made good,<br />
	May they not be my oracles as well,<br />
	And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.<br />
	(Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY MACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants)</p>
<p>
	MACBETH<br />
	Here&#39;s our chief guest.</p>
<p>
	LADY MACBETH<br />
	If he had been forgotten,<br />
	It had been as a gap in our great feast,<br />
	And all-thing unbecoming.</p>
<p>
	MACBETH<br />
	To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,<br />
	And I&#39;ll request your presence.</p>
<p>
	BANQUO<br />
	Let your highness<br />
	Command upon me; to the which my duties<br />
	Are with a most indissoluble tie<br />
	For ever knit.</p>
<p>
	MACBETH<br />
	Ride you this afternoon?</p>
<p>
	BANQUO<br />
	Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p>
	MACBETH<br />
	We should have else desired your good advice,<br />
	Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,<br />
	In this day&#39;s council; but we&#39;ll take to-morrow.<br />
	Is&#39;t far you ride?</p>
<p>
	BANQUO<br />
	As far, my lord, as will fill up the time<br />
	&#39;Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,<br />
	I must become a borrower of the night<br />
	For a dark hour or twain.</p>
<p>
	MACBETH<br />
	Fail not our feast.</p>
<p>
	BANQUO<br />
	My lord, I will not.</p>
<p>
	MACBETH<br />
	We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow&#39;d<br />
	In England and in Ireland, not confessing<br />
	Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers<br />
	With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,<br />
	When therewithal we shall have cause of state<br />
	Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,<br />
	Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?</p>
<p>
	BANQUO<br />
	Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon &#39;s.</p>
<p>
	MACBETH<br />
	I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;<br />
	And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.</p>
<p>
	(Exit BANQUO)</p>
<p>
	Let every man be master of his time<br />
	Till seven at night: to make society<br />
	The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself<br />
	Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant)</p>
<p>
	Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men<br />
	Our pleasure?</p>
<p>
	ATTENDANT<br />
	They are, my lord, without the palace gate.</p>
<p>
	MACBETH<br />
	Bring them before us.</p>
<p>
	(Exit Attendant)</p>
<p>
	To be thus is nothing;<br />
	But to be safely thus.&mdash;Our fears in Banquo<br />
	Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature<br />
	Reigns that which would be fear&#39;d: &#39;tis much he dares;<br />
	And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,<br />
	He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour<br />
	To act in safety. There is none but he<br />
	Whose being I do fear: and, under him,<br />
	My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,<br />
	Mark Antony&#39;s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters<br />
	When first they put the name of king upon me,<br />
	And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like<br />
	They hail&#39;d him father to a line of kings:<br />
	Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,<br />
	And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,<br />
	Thence to be wrench&#39;d with an unlineal hand,<br />
	No son of mine succeeding. If &#39;t be so,<br />
	For Banquo&#39;s issue have I filed my mind;<br />
	For them the gracious Duncan have I murder&#39;d;<br />
	Put rancours in the vessel of my peace<br />
	Only for them; and mine eternal jewel<br />
	Given to the common enemy of man,<br />
	To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!<br />
	Rather than so, come fate into the list.<br />
	And champion me to the utterance! Who&#39;s there!</p>
<p>
	(Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers)</p>
<p>
	Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.</p>
<p>
	(Exit Attendant)</p>
<p>
	Was it not yesterday we spoke together?</p>
<p>
	First Murderer<br />
	It was, so please your highness.</p>
<p>
	MACBETH<br />
	Well then, now<br />
	Have you consider&#39;d of my speeches? Know<br />
	That it was he in the times past which held you<br />
	So under fortune, which you thought had been<br />
	Our innocent self: this I made good to you<br />
	In our last conference, pass&#39;d in probation with you,<br />
	How you were borne in hand, how cross&#39;d, the instruments,<br />
	Who wrought with them, and all things else that might<br />
	To half a soul and to a notion crazed<br />
	Say &#39;Thus did Banquo.&#39;</p>
<p>
	First Murderer<br />
	You made it known to us.</p>
<p>
	MACBETH<br />
	I did so, and went further, which is now<br />
	Our point of second meeting. Do you find<br />
	Your patience so predominant in your nature<br />
	That you can let this go? Are you so gospell&#39;d<br />
	To pray for this good man and for his issue,<br />
	Whose heavy hand hath bow&#39;d you to the grave<br />
	And beggar&#39;d yours for ever?</p>
<p>
	First Murderer<br />
	We are men, my liege.</p>
<p>
	MACBETH<br />
	Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;<br />
	As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,<br />
	Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept<br />
	All by the name of dogs: the valued file<br />
	Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,<br />
	The housekeeper, the hunter, every one<br />
	According to the gift which bounteous nature<br />
	Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive<br />
	Particular addition. from the bill<br />
	That writes them all alike: and so of men.<br />
	Now, if you have a station in the file,<br />
	Not i&#39; the worst rank of manhood, say &#39;t;<br />
	And I will put that business in your bosoms,<br />
	Whose execution takes your enemy off,<br />
	Grapples you to the heart and love of us,<br />
	Who wear our health but sickly in his life,<br />
	Which in his death were perfect.</p>
<p>
	Second Murderer<br />
	I am one, my liege,<br />
	Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world<br />
	Have so incensed that I am reckless what<br />
	I do to spite the world.</p>
<p>
	First Murderer<br />
	And I another<br />
	So weary with disasters, tugg&#39;d with fortune,<br />
	That I would set my lie on any chance,<br />
	To mend it, or be rid on&#39;t.</p>
<p>
	MACBETH<br />
	Both of you<br />
	Know Banquo was your enemy.<br />
	Both Murderers<br />
	True, my lord.</p>
<p>
	MACBETH<br />
	So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,<br />
	That every minute of his being thrusts<br />
	Against my near&#39;st of life: and though I could<br />
	With barefaced power sweep him from my sight<br />
	And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,<br />
	For certain friends that are both his and mine,<br />
	Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall<br />
	Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,<br />
	That I to your assistance do make love,<br />
	Masking the business from the common eye<br />
	For sundry weighty reasons.<br />
	Second Murderer<br />
	We shall, my lord,<br />
	Perform what you command us.<br />
	First Murderer<br />
	Though our lives&mdash;</p>
<p>
	MACBETH<br />
	Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most<br />
	I will advise you where to plant yourselves;<br />
	Acquaint you with the perfect spy o&#39; the time,<br />
	The moment on&#39;t; for&#39;t must be done to-night,<br />
	And something from the palace; always thought<br />
	That I require a clearness: and with him&mdash;<br />
	To leave no rubs nor botches in the work&mdash;<br />
	Fleance his son, that keeps him company,<br />
	Whose absence is no less material to me<br />
	Than is his father&#39;s, must embrace the fate<br />
	Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:<br />
	I&#39;ll come to you anon.<br />
	Both Murderers<br />
	We are resolved, my lord.</p>
<p>
	MACBETH<br />
	I&#39;ll call upon you straight: abide within.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt Murderers)</p>
<p>
	It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul&#39;s flight,<br />
	If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.</p>
<p>
	(Exit)</p>
