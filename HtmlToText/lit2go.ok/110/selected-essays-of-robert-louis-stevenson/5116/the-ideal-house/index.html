                <p>
	Two things are necessary in any neighbourhood where we propose to spend a life: a desert and some living water.</p>
<p>
	There are many parts of the earth&rsquo;s face which offer the necessary combination of a certain wildness with a kindly variety.&nbsp; A great prospect is desirable, but the want may be otherwise supplied; even greatness can be found on the small scale; for the mind and the eye measure differently.&nbsp; Bold rocks near hand are more inspiriting than distant Alps, and the thick fern upon a Surrey heath makes a fine forest for the imagination, and the dotted yew trees noble mountains.&nbsp; A Scottish moor with birches and firs grouped here and there upon a knoll, or one of those rocky seaside deserts of Provence overgrown with rosemary and thyme and smoking with aroma, are places where the mind is never weary.&nbsp; Forests, being more enclosed, are not at first sight so attractive, but they exercise a spell; they must, however, be diversified with either heath or rock, and are hardly to be considered perfect without conifers.&nbsp; Even sand&ndash;hills, with their intricate plan, and their gulls and rabbits, will stand well for the necessary desert.</p>
<p>
	The house must be within hail of either a little river or the sea.&nbsp; A great river is more fit for poetry than to adorn a neighbourhood; its sweep of waters increases the scale of the scenery and the distance of one notable object from another; and a lively burn gives us, in the space of a few yards, a greater variety of promontory and islet, of cascade, shallow goil, and boiling pool, with answerable changes both of song and colour, than a navigable stream in many hundred miles.&nbsp; The fish, too, make a more considerable feature of the brookside, and the trout plumping in the shadow takes the ear.&nbsp; A stream should, besides, be narrow enough to cross, or the burn hard by a bridge, or we are at once shut out of Eden.&nbsp; The quantity of water need be of no concern, for the mind sets the scale, and can enjoy a Niagara Fall of thirty inches.&nbsp; Let us approve the singer of</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Shallow rivers, by whose falls<br />
	Melodious birds sing madrigals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	If the sea is to be our ornamental water, choose an open seaboard with a heavy beat of surf; one much broken in outline, with small havens and dwarf headlands; if possible a few islets; and as a first necessity, rocks reaching out into deep water.&nbsp; Such a rock on a calm day is a better station than the top of Teneriffe or Chimborazo.&nbsp; In short, both for the desert and the water, the conjunction of many near and bold details is bold scenery for the imagination and keeps the mind alive.</p>
<p>
	Given these two prime luxuries, the nature of the country where we are to live is, I had almost said, indifferent; after that inside the garden, we can construct a country of our own.&nbsp; Several old trees, a considerable variety of level, several well&ndash;grown hedges to divide our garden into provinces, a good extent of old well&ndash;set turf, and thickets of shrubs and ever&ndash;greens to be cut into and cleared at the new owner&rsquo;s pleasure, are the qualities to be sought for in your chosen land.&nbsp; Nothing is more delightful than a succession of small lawns, opening one out of the other through tall hedges; these have all the charm of the old bowling&ndash;green repeated, do not require the labour of many trimmers, and afford a series of changes.&nbsp; You must have much lawn against the early summer, so as to have a great field of daisies, the year&rsquo;s morning frost; as you must have a wood of lilacs, to enjoy to the full the period of their blossoming.&nbsp; Hawthorn is another of the Spring&rsquo;s ingredients; but it is even best to have a rough public lane at one side of your enclosure which, at the right season, shall become an avenue of bloom and odour.&nbsp; The old flowers are the best and should grow carelessly in corners.&nbsp; Indeed, the ideal fortune is to find an old garden, once very richly cared for, since sunk into neglect, and to tend, not repair, that neglect; it will thus have a smack of nature and wildness which skilful dispositions cannot overtake.&nbsp; The gardener should be an idler, and have a gross partiality to the kitchen plots: an eager or toilful gardener misbecomes the garden landscape; a tasteful gardener will be ever meddling, will keep the borders raw, and take the bloom off nature.&nbsp; Close adjoining, if you are in the south, an olive&ndash;yard, if in the north, a swarded apple&ndash;orchard reaching to the stream, completes your miniature domain; but this is perhaps best entered through a door in the high fruit&ndash;wall; so that you close the door behind you on your sunny plots, your hedges and evergreen jungle, when you go down to watch the apples falling in the pool.&nbsp; It is a golden maxim to cultivate the garden for the nose, and the eyes will take care of themselves.&nbsp; Nor must the ear be forgotten: without birds a garden is a prison&ndash;yard.&nbsp; There is a garden near Marseilles on a steep hill&ndash;side, walking by which, upon a sunny morning, your ear will suddenly be ravished with a burst of small and very cheerful singing: some score of cages being set out there to sun their occupants.&nbsp; This is a heavenly surprise to any passer&ndash;by; but the price paid, to keep so many ardent and winged creatures from their liberty, will make the luxury too dear for any thoughtful pleasure&ndash;lover.&nbsp; There is only one sort of bird that I can tolerate caged, though even then I think it hard, and that is what is called in France the Bec&ndash;d&rsquo;Argent.&nbsp; I once had two of these pigmies in captivity; and in the quiet, hire house upon a silent street where I was then living, their song, which was not much louder than a bee&rsquo;s, but airily musical, kept me in a perpetual good humour.&nbsp; I put the cage upon my table when I worked, carried it with me when I went for meals, and kept it by my head at night: the first thing in the morning, these maestrini would pipe up.&nbsp; But these, even if you can pardon their imprisonment, are for the house.&nbsp; In the garden the wild birds must plant a colony, a chorus of the lesser warblers that should be almost deafening, a blackbird in the lilacs, a nightingale down the lane, so that you must stroll to hear it, and yet a little farther, tree&ndash;tops populous with rooks.</p>
<p>
	Your house should not command much outlook; it should be set deep and green, though upon rising ground, or, if possible, crowning a knoll, for the sake of drainage.&nbsp; Yet it must be open to the east, or you will miss the sunrise; sunset occurring so much later, you can go up a few steps and look the other way.&nbsp; A house of more than two stories is a mere barrack; indeed the ideal is of one story, raised upon cellars.&nbsp; If the rooms are large, the house may be small: a single room, lofty, spacious, and lightsome, is more palatial than a castleful of cabinets and cupboards.&nbsp; Yet size in a house, and some extent and intricacy of corridor, is certainly delightful to the flesh.&nbsp; The reception room should be, if possible, a place of many recesses, which are &lsquo;petty retiring places for conference&rsquo;; but it must have one long wall with a divan: for a day spent upon a divan, among a world of cushions, is as full of diversion as to travel.&nbsp; The eating&ndash;room, in the French mode, should be ad hoc: unfurnished, but with a buffet, the table, necessary chairs, one or two of Canaletto&rsquo;s etchings, and a tile fire&ndash;place for the winter.&nbsp; In neither of these public places should there be anything beyond a shelf or two of books; but the passages may be one library from end to end, and the stair, if there be one, lined with volumes in old leather, very brightly carpeted, and leading half&ndash;way up, and by way of landing, to a windowed recess with a fire&ndash;place; this window, almost alone in the house, should command a handsome prospect.&nbsp; Husband and wife must each possess a studio; on the woman&rsquo;s sanctuary I hesitate to dwell, and turn to the man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The walls are shelved waist&ndash;high for books, and the top thus forms a continuous table running round the wall.&nbsp; Above are prints, a large map of the neighbourhood, a Corot and a Claude or two.&nbsp; The room is very spacious, and the five tables and two chairs are but as islands.&nbsp; One table is for actual work, one close by for references in use; one, very large, for MSS. or proofs that wait their turn; one kept clear for an occasion; and the fifth is the map table, groaning under a collection of large&ndash;scale maps and charts.&nbsp; Of all books these are the least wearisome to read and the richest in matter; the course of roads and rivers, the contour lines and the forests in the maps&mdash;the reefs, soundings, anchors, sailing marks and little pilot&ndash;pictures in the charts&mdash;and, in both, the bead&ndash;roll of names, make them of all printed matter the most fit to stimulate and satisfy the fancy.&nbsp; The chair in which you write is very low and easy, and backed into a corner; at one elbow the fire twinkles; close at the other, if you are a little inhumane, your cage of silver&ndash;bills are twittering into song.</p>
<p>
	Joined along by a passage, you may reach the great, sunny, glass&ndash;roofed, and tiled gymnasium, at the far end of which, lined with bright marble, is your plunge and swimming bath, fitted with a capacious boiler.</p>
<p>
	The whole loft of the house from end to end makes one undivided chamber; here are set forth tables on which to model imaginary or actual countries in putty or plaster, with tools and hardy pigments; a carpenter&rsquo;s bench; and a spared corner for photography, while at the far end a space is kept clear for playing soldiers.&nbsp; Two boxes contain the two armies of some five hundred horse and foot; two others the ammunition of each side, and a fifth the foot&ndash;rules and the three colours of chalk, with which you lay down, or, after a day&rsquo;s play, refresh the outlines of the country; red or white for the two kinds of road (according as they are suitable or not for the passage of ordnance), and blue for the course of the obstructing rivers.&nbsp; Here I foresee that you may pass much happy time; against a good adversary a game may well continue for a month; for with armies so considerable three moves will occupy an hour.&nbsp; It will be found to set an excellent edge on this diversion if one of the players shall, every day or so, write a report of the operations in the character of army correspondent.</p>
<p>
	I have left to the last the little room for winter evenings.&nbsp; This should be furnished in warm positive colours, and sofas and floor thick with rich furs.&nbsp; The hearth, where you burn wood of aromatic quality on silver dogs, tiled round about with Bible pictures; the seats deep and easy; a single Titian in a gold frame; a white bust or so upon a bracket; a rack for the journals of the week; a table for the books of the year; and close in a corner the three shelves full of eternal books that never weary: Shakespeare, Moli&egrave;re, Montaigne, Lamb, Sterne, De Musset&rsquo;s comedies (the one volume open at Carmosine and the other at Fantasio); the Arabian Nights, and kindred stories, in Weber&rsquo;s solemn volumes; Borrow&rsquo;s Bible in Spain, the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress, Guy Mannering and Rob Roy, Monte Cristo and the Vicomte de Bragelonne, immortal Boswell sole among biographers, Chaucer, Herrick, and the State Trials.</p>
<p>
	The bedrooms are large, airy, with almost no furniture, floors of varnished wood, and at the bed&ndash;head, in case of insomnia, one shelf of books of a particular and dippable order, such as Pepys, the Paston Letters, Burt&rsquo;s Letters from the Highlands, or the Newgate Calendar. . . .</p>
