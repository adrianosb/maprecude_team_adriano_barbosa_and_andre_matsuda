                <p>
	&ldquo;No, not I,&rdquo; said Silver. &ldquo;Flint was cap&rsquo;n; I was quartermaster, along of my timber leg. The same broadside I lost my leg, old Pew lost his deadlights. It was a master surgeon, him that ampytated me&mdash;out of college and all&mdash;Latin by the bucket, and what not; but he was hanged like a dog, and sun-dried like the rest, at Corso Castle. That was Roberts&rsquo; men, that was, and comed of changing names to their ships&mdash;ROYAL FORTUNE and so on. Now, what a ship was christened, so let her stay, I says. So it was with the CASSANDRA, as brought us all safe home from Malabar, after England took the viceroy of the Indies; so it was with the old WALRUS, Flint&rsquo;s old ship, as I&rsquo;ve seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried another voice, that of the youngest hand on board, and evidently full of admiration. &ldquo;He was the flower of the flock, was Flint!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Davis was a man too, by all accounts,&rdquo; said Silver. &ldquo;I never sailed along of him; first with England, then with Flint, that&rsquo;s my story; and now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking. I laid by nine hundred safe, from England, and two thousand after Flint. That ain&rsquo;t bad for a man before the mast&mdash;all safe in bank. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t earning now, it&rsquo;s saving does it, you may lay to that. Where&rsquo;s all England&rsquo;s men now? I dunno. Where&rsquo;s Flint&rsquo;s? Why, most on &lsquo;em aboard here, and glad to get the duff&mdash;been begging before that, some on &lsquo;em. Old Pew, as had lost his sight, and might have thought shame, spends twelve hundred pound in a year, like a lord in Parliament. Where is he now? Well, he&rsquo;s dead now and under hatches; but for two year before that, shiver my timbers, the man was starving! He begged, and he stole, and he cut throats, and starved at that, by the powers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, it ain&rsquo;t much use, after all,&rdquo; said the young seaman.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t much use for fools, you may lay to it&mdash;that, nor nothing,&rdquo; cried Silver. &ldquo;But now, you look here: you&rsquo;re young, you are, but you&rsquo;re as smart as paint. I see that when I set my eyes on you, and I&rsquo;ll talk to you like a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	You may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old rogue addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used to myself. I think, if I had been able, that I would have killed him through the barrel. Meantime, he ran on, little supposing he was overheard.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Here it is about gentlemen of fortune. They lives rough, and they risk swinging, but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks, and when a cruise is done, why, it&rsquo;s hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in their pockets. Now, the most goes for rum and a good fling, and to sea again in their shirts. But that&rsquo;s not the course I lay. I puts it all away, some here, some there, and none too much anywheres, by reason of suspicion. I&rsquo;m fifty, mark you; once back from this cruise, I set up gentleman in earnest. Time enough too, says you. Ah, but I&rsquo;ve lived easy in the meantime, never denied myself o&rsquo; nothing heart desires, and slep&rsquo; soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea. And how did I begin? Before the mast, like you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;but all the other money&rsquo;s gone now, ain&rsquo;t it? You daren&rsquo;t show face in Bristol after this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Why, where might you suppose it was?&rdquo; asked Silver derisively.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;At Bristol, in banks and places,&rdquo; answered his companion.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It were,&rdquo; said the cook; &ldquo;it were when we weighed anchor. But my old missis has it all by now. And the Spy-glass is sold, lease and goodwill and rigging; and the old girl&rsquo;s off to meet me. I would tell you where, for I trust you, but it&rsquo;d make jealousy among the mates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And can you trust your missis?&rdquo; asked the other.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Gentlemen of fortune,&rdquo; returned the cook, &ldquo;usually trusts little among themselves, and right they are, you may lay to it. But I have a way with me, I have. When a mate brings a slip on his cable&mdash;one as knows me, I mean&mdash;it won&rsquo;t be in the same world with old John. There was some that was feared of Pew, and some that was feared of Flint; but Flint his own self was feared of me. Feared he was, and proud. They was the roughest crew afloat, was Flint&rsquo;s; the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them. Well now, I tell you, I&rsquo;m not a boasting man, and you seen yourself how easy I keep company, but when I was quartermaster, LAMBS wasn&rsquo;t the word for Flint&rsquo;s old buccaneers. Ah, you may be sure of yourself in old John&rsquo;s ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, I tell you now,&rdquo; replied the lad, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t half a quarter like the job till I had this talk with you, John; but there&rsquo;s my hand on it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And a brave lad you were, and smart too,&rdquo; answered Silver, shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook, &ldquo;and a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms. By a &ldquo;gentleman of fortune&rdquo; they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate, and the little scene that I had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest hands&mdash;perhaps of the last one left aboard. But on this point I was soon to be relieved, for Silver giving a little whistle, a third man strolled up and sat down by the party.</p>
<br />
<p>
	&ldquo;Dick&rsquo;s square,&rdquo; said Silver.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, I know&rsquo;d Dick was square,&rdquo; returned the voice of the coxswain, Israel Hands. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no fool, is Dick.&rdquo; And he turned his quid and spat. &ldquo;But look here,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s what I want to know, Barbecue: how long are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat? I&rsquo;ve had a&rsquo;most enough o&rsquo; Cap&rsquo;n Smollett; he&rsquo;s hazed me long enough, by thunder! I want to go into that cabin, I do. I want their pickles and wines, and that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Israel,&rdquo; said Silver, &ldquo;your head ain&rsquo;t much account, nor ever was. But you&rsquo;re able to hear, I reckon; leastways, your ears is big enough. Now, here&rsquo;s what I say: you&rsquo;ll berth forward, and you&rsquo;ll live hard, and you&rsquo;ll speak soft, and you&rsquo;ll keep sober till I give the word; and you may lay to that, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t say no, do I?&rdquo; growled the coxswain. &ldquo;What I say is, when? That&rsquo;s what I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;When! By the powers!&rdquo; cried Silver. &ldquo;Well now, if you want to know, I&rsquo;ll tell you when. The last moment I can manage, and that&rsquo;s when. Here&rsquo;s a first-rate seaman, Cap&rsquo;n Smollett, sails the blessed ship for us. Here&rsquo;s this squire and doctor with a map and such&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know where it is, do I? No more do you, says you. Well then, I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard, by the powers. Then we&rsquo;ll see. If I was sure of you all, sons of double Dutchmen, I&rsquo;d have Cap&rsquo;n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;re all seamen aboard here, I should think,&rdquo; said the lad Dick.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all forecastle hands, you mean,&rdquo; snapped Silver. &ldquo;We can steer a course, but who&rsquo;s to set one? That&rsquo;s what all you gentlemen split on, first and last. If I had my way, I&rsquo;d have Cap&rsquo;n Smollett work us back into the trades at least; then we&rsquo;d have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day. But I know the sort you are. I&rsquo;ll finish with &lsquo;em at the island, as soon&rsquo;s the blunt&rsquo;s on board, and a pity it is. But you&rsquo;re never happy till you&rsquo;re drunk. Split my sides, I&rsquo;ve a sick heart to sail with the likes of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Easy all, Long John,&rdquo; cried Israel. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a-crossin&rsquo; of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Why, how many tall ships, think ye, now, have I seen laid aboard? And how many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock?&rdquo; cried Silver. &ldquo;And all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry. You hear me? I seen a thing or two at sea, I have. If you would on&rsquo;y lay your course, and a p&rsquo;int to windward, you would ride in carriages, you would. But not you! I know you. You&rsquo;ll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow, and go hang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling, John; but there&rsquo;s others as could hand and steer as well as you,&rdquo; said Israel. &ldquo;They liked a bit o&rsquo; fun, they did. They wasn&rsquo;t so high and dry, nohow, but took their fling, like jolly companions every one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So?&rdquo; says Silver. &ldquo;Well, and where are they now? Pew was that sort, and he died a beggar-man. Flint was, and he died of rum at Savannah. Ah, they was a sweet crew, they was! On&rsquo;y, where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked Dick, &ldquo;when we do lay &lsquo;em athwart, what are we to do with &lsquo;em, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the man for me!&rdquo; cried the cook admiringly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call business. Well, what would you think? Put &lsquo;em ashore like maroons? That would have been England&rsquo;s way. Or cut &lsquo;em down like that much pork? That would have been Flint&rsquo;s, or Billy Bones&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Billy was the man for that,&rdquo; said Israel. &ldquo;&rsquo;Dead men don&rsquo;t bite,&rsquo; says he. Well, he&rsquo;s dead now hisself; he knows the long and short on it now; and if ever a rough hand come to port, it was Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; said Silver; &ldquo;rough and ready. But mark you here, I&rsquo;m an easy man&mdash;I&rsquo;m quite the gentleman, says you; but this time it&rsquo;s serious. Dooty is dooty, mates. I give my vote&mdash;death. When I&rsquo;m in Parlyment and riding in my coach, I don&rsquo;t want none of these sea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home, unlooked for, like the devil at prayers. Wait is what I say; but when the time comes, why, let her rip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;John,&rdquo; cries the coxswain, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll say so, Israel when you see,&rdquo; said Silver. &ldquo;Only one thing I claim&mdash;I claim Trelawney. I&rsquo;ll wring his calf&rsquo;s head off his body with these hands, Dick!&rdquo; he added, breaking off. &ldquo;You just jump up, like a sweet lad, and get me an apple, to wet my pipe like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	You may fancy the terror I was in! I should have leaped out and run for it if I had found the strength, but my limbs and heart alike misgave me. I heard Dick begin to rise, and then someone seemingly stopped him, and the voice of Hands exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, stow that! Don&rsquo;t you get sucking of that bilge, John. Let&rsquo;s have a go of the rum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; said Silver, &ldquo;I trust you. I&rsquo;ve a gauge on the keg, mind. There&rsquo;s the key; you fill a pannikin and bring it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
