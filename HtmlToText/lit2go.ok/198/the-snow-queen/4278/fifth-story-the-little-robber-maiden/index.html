                <p>
	They drove through the dark wood; but the carriage shone like a torch, and it dazzled the eyes of the robbers, so that they could not bear to look at it.</p>
<p>
	&quot;&#39;Tis gold! &#39;Tis gold!&quot; they cried; and they rushed forward, seized the horses, knocked down the little postilion, the coachman, and the servants, and pulled little Gerda out of the carriage.</p>
<p>
	&quot;How plump, how beautiful she is! She must have been fed on nut&ndash;kernels,&quot; said the old female robber, who had a long, scrubby beard, and bushy eyebrows that hung down over her eyes. &quot;She is as good as a fatted lamb! How nice she will be!&quot; And then she drew out a knife, the blade of which shone so that it was quite dreadful to behold.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Oh!&quot; cried the woman at the same moment. She had been bitten in the ear by her own little daughter, who hung at her back; and who was so wild and unmanageable, that it was quite amusing to see her. &quot;You naughty child!&quot; said the mother: and now she had not time to kill Gerda.</p>
<p>
	&quot;She shall play with me,&quot; said the little robber child. &quot;She shall give me her muff, and her pretty frock; she shall sleep in my bed!&quot; And then she gave her mother another bite, so that she jumped, and ran round with the pain; and the Robbers laughed, and said, &quot;Look, how she is dancing with the little one!&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I will go into the carriage,&quot; said the little robber maiden; and she would have her will, for she was very spoiled and very headstrong. She and Gerda got in; and then away they drove over the stumps of felled trees, deeper and deeper into the woods. The little robber maiden was as tall as Gerda, but stronger, broader&ndash;shouldered, and of dark complexion; her eyes were quite black; they looked almost melancholy. She embraced little Gerda, and said, &quot;They shall not kill you as long as I am not displeased with you. You are, doubtless, a Princess?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;No,&quot; said little Gerda; who then related all that had happened to her, and how much she cared about little Kay.</p>
<p>
	The little robber maiden looked at her with a serious air, nodded her head slightly, and said, &quot;They shall not kill you, even if I am angry with you: then I will do it myself&quot;; and she dried Gerda&#39;s eyes, and put both her hands in the handsome muff, which was so soft and warm.</p>
<p>
	At length the carriage stopped. They were in the midst of the court&ndash;yard of a robber&#39;s castle. It was full of cracks from top to bottom; and out of the openings magpies and rooks were flying; and the great bull&ndash;dogs, each of which looked as if he could swallow a man, jumped up, but they did not bark, for that was forbidden.</p>
<p>
	In the midst of the large, old, smoking hall burnt a great fire on the stone floor. The smoke disappeared under the stones, and had to seek its own egress. In an immense caldron soup was boiling; and rabbits and hares were being roasted on a spit.</p>
<p>
	&quot;You shall sleep with me to&ndash;night, with all my animals,&quot; said the little robber maiden. They had something to eat and drink; and then went into a corner, where straw and carpets were lying. Beside them, on laths and perches, sat nearly a hundred pigeons, all asleep, seemingly; but yet they moved a little when the robber maiden came. &quot;They are all mine,&quot; said she, at the same time seizing one that was next to her by the legs and shaking it so that its wings fluttered. &quot;Kiss it,&quot; cried the little girl, and flung the pigeon in Gerda&#39;s face. &quot;Up there is the rabble of the wood, continued she, pointing to several laths which were fastened before a hole high up in the wall; &quot;that&#39;s the rabble; they would all fly away immediately, if they were not well fastened in. And here is my dear old Bac&quot;; and she laid hold of the horns of a reindeer, that had a bright copper ring round its neck, and was tethered to the spot. &quot;We are obliged to lock this fellow in too, or he would make his escape. Every evening I tickle his neck with my sharp knife; he is so frightened at it!&quot; and the little girl drew forth a long knife, from a crack in the wall, and let it glide over the Reindeer&#39;s neck. The poor animal kicked; the girl laughed, and pulled Gerda into bed with her.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Do you intend to keep your knife while you sleep?&quot; asked Gerda; looking at it rather fearfully.</p>
<p>
	&quot;I always sleep with the knife,&quot; said the little robber maiden. &quot;There is no knowing what may happen. But tell me now, once more, all about little Kay; and why you have started off in the wide world alone.&quot; And Gerda related all, from the very beginning: the Wood&ndash;pigeons cooed above in their cage, and the others slept. The little robber maiden wound her arm round Gerda&#39;s neck, held the knife in the other hand, and snored so loud that everybody could hear her; but Gerda could not close her eyes, for she did not know whether she was to live or die. The robbers sat round the fire, sang and drank; and the old female robber jumped about so, that it was quite dreadful for Gerda to see her.</p>
<p>
	Then the Wood&ndash;pigeons said, &quot;Coo! Cool We have seen little Kay! A white hen carries his sledge; he himself sat in the carriage of the Snow Queen, who passed here, down just over the wood, as we lay in our nest. She blew upon us young ones; and all died except we two. Coo! Coo!&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;What is that you say up there?&quot; cried little Gerda. &quot;Where did the Snow Queen go to? Do you know anything about it?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;She is no doubt gone to Lapland; for there is always snow and ice there. Only ask the Reindeer, who is tethered there.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Ice and snow is there! There it is, glorious and beautiful!&quot; said the Reindeer. &quot;One can spring about in the large shining valleys! The Snow Queen has her summer&ndash;tent there; but her fixed abode is high up towards the North Pole, on the Island called Spitzbergen.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Oh, Kay! Poor little Kay!&quot; sighed Gerda.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Do you choose to be quiet?&quot; said the robber maiden. &quot;If you don&#39;t, I shall make you.&quot;</p>
<p>
	In the morning Gerda told her all that the Wood&ndash;pigeons had said; and the little maiden looked very serious, but she nodded her head, and said, &quot;That&#39;s no matter&ndash;that&#39;s no matter. Do you know where Lapland lies!&quot; she asked of the Reindeer.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Who should know better than I?&quot; said the animal; and his eyes rolled in his head. &quot;I was born and bred there&mdash;there I leapt about on the fields of snow.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Listen,&quot; said the robber maiden to Gerda. &quot;You see that the men are gone; but my mother is still here, and will remain. However, towards morning she takes a draught out of the large flask, and then she sleeps a little: then I will do something for you.&quot; She now jumped out of bed, flew to her mother; with her arms round her neck, and pulling her by the beard, said, &quot;Good morrow, my own sweet nanny&ndash;goat of a mother.&quot; And her mother took hold of her nose, and pinched it till it was red and blue; but this was all done out of pure love.</p>
<p>
	When the mother had taken a sup at her flask, and was having a nap, the little robber maiden went to the Reindeer, and said, &quot;I should very much like to give you still many a tickling with the sharp knife, for then you are so amusing; however, I will untether you, and help you out, so that you may go back to Lapland. But you must make good use of your legs; and take this little girl for me to the palace of the Snow Queen, where her playfellow is. You have heard, I suppose, all she said; for she spoke loud enough, and you were listening.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The Reindeer gave a bound for joy. The robber maiden lifted up little Gerda, and took the precaution to bind her fast on the Reindeer&#39;s back; she even gave her a small cushion to sit on. &quot;Here are your worsted leggins, for it will be cold; but the muff I shall keep for myself, for it is so very pretty. But I do not wish you to be cold. Here is a pair of lined gloves of my mother&#39;s; they just reach up to your elbow. On with them! Now you look about the hands just like my ugly old mother!&quot;</p>
<p>
	And Gerda wept for joy.</p>
<p>
	&quot;I can&#39;t bear to see you fretting,&quot; said the little robber maiden. &quot;This is just the time when you ought to look pleased. Here are two loaves and a ham for you, so that you won&#39;t starve.&quot; The bread and the meat were fastened to the Reindeer&#39;s back; the little maiden opened the door, called in all the dogs, and then with her knife cut the rope that fastened the animal, and said to him, &quot;Now, off with you; but take good care of the little girl!&quot;</p>
<p>
	And Gerda stretched out her hands with the large wadded gloves towards the robber maiden, and said, &quot;Farewell!&quot; and the Reindeer flew on over bush and bramble through the great wood, over moor and heath, as fast as he could go.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Ddsa! Ddsa!&quot; was heard in the sky. It was just as if somebody was sneezing.</p>
<p>
	&quot;These are my old northern&ndash;lights,&quot; said the Reindeer, &quot;look how they gleam! And on he now sped still quicker&mdash;day and night on he went: the loaves were consumed, and the ham too; and now they were in Lapland.</p>
