                <p>
	Ah, yes, &lsquo;t is sweet still to remember,<br />
	Though &lsquo;twere less painful to forget;<br />
	For while my heart glows like an ember,<br />
	Mine eyes with sorrow&rsquo;s drops are wet,<br />
	And, oh, my heart is aching yet.<br />
	It is a law of mortal pain<br />
	That old wounds, long accounted well,<br />
	Beneath the memory&rsquo;s potent spell,<br />
	Will wake to life and bleed again.</p>
<p>
	So &lsquo;t is with me; it might be better<br />
	If I should turn no look behind,&mdash;<br />
	If I could curb my heart, and fetter<br />
	From reminiscent gaze my mind,<br />
	Or let my soul go blind&mdash;go blind!<br />
	But would I do it if I could?<br />
	Nay! ease at such a price were spurned;<br />
	For, since my love was once returned,<br />
	All that I suffer seemeth good.</p>
<p>
	I know, I know it is the fashion,<br />
	When love has left some heart distressed,<br />
	To weight the air with wordful passion;<br />
	But I am glad that in my breast<br />
	I ever held so dear a guest.<br />
	Love does not come at every nod,<br />
	Or every voice that calleth &ldquo;hasten;&rdquo;<br />
	He seeketh out some heart to chasten,<br />
	And whips it, wailing, up to God!</p>
<p>
	Love is no random road wayfarer<br />
	Who where he may must sip his glass.<br />
	Love is the King, the Purple&ndash;Wearer,<br />
	Whose guard recks not of tree or grass<br />
	To blaze the way that he may pass.<br />
	What if my heart be in the blast<br />
	That heralds his triumphant way;<br />
	Shall I repine, shall I not say:<br />
	&ldquo;Rejoice, my heart, the King has passed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	In life, each heart holds some sad story&mdash;<br />
	The saddest ones are never told.<br />
	I, too, have dreamed of fame and glory,<br />
	And viewed the future bright with gold;<br />
	But that is as a tale long told.<br />
	Mine eyes have lost their youthful flash,<br />
	My cunning hand has lost its art;<br />
	I am not old, but in my heart<br />
	The ember lies beneath the ash.</p>
<p>
	I loved! Why not? My heart was youthful,<br />
	My mind was filled with healthy thought.<br />
	He doubts not whose own self is truthful,<br />
	Doubt by dishonesty is taught;<br />
	So loved I boldly, fearing naught.<br />
	I did not walk this lowly earth;<br />
	Mine was a newer, higher sphere,<br />
	Where youth was long and life was dear,<br />
	And all save love was little worth.</p>
<p>
	Her likeness! Would that I might limn it,<br />
	As Love did, with enduring art;<br />
	Nor dust of days nor death may dim it,<br />
	Where it lies graven on my heart,<br />
	Of this sad fabric of my life a part.<br />
	I would that I might paint her now<br />
	As I beheld her in that day,<br />
	Ere her first bloom had passed away,<br />
	And left the lines upon her brow.</p>
<p>
	A face serene that, beaming brightly,<br />
	Disarmed the hot sun&rsquo;s glances bold.<br />
	A foot that kissed the ground so lightly,<br />
	He frowned in wrath and deemed her cold,<br />
	But loved her still though he was old.<br />
	A form where every maiden grace<br />
	Bloomed to perfection&rsquo;s richest flower,&mdash;<br />
	The statued pose of conscious power,<br />
	Like lithe&ndash;limbed Dian&rsquo;s of the chase.</p>
<p>
	Beneath a brow too fair for frowning,<br />
	Like moon&ndash;lit deeps that glass the skies<br />
	Till all the hosts above seem drowning,<br />
	Looked forth her steadfast hazel eyes,<br />
	With gaze serene and purely wise.<br />
	And over all, her tresses rare,<br />
	Which, when, with his desire grown weak,<br />
	The Night bent down to kiss her cheek,<br />
	Entrapped and held him captive there.</p>
<p>
	This was Ione; a spirit finer<br />
	Ne&rsquo;er burned to ash its house of clay;<br />
	A soul instinct with fire diviner<br />
	Ne&rsquo;er fled athwart the face of day,<br />
	And tempted Time with earthly stay.<br />
	Her loveliness was not alone<br />
	Of face and form and tresses&rsquo; hue:<br />
	For aye a pure, high soul shone through<br />
	Her every act: this was Ione.</p>
<p>
	II</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;T was in the radiant summer weather,<br />
	When God looked, smiling, from the sky;<br />
	And we went wand&rsquo;ring much together<br />
	By wood and lane, Ione and I,<br />
	Attracted by the subtle tie<br />
	Of common thoughts and common tastes,<br />
	Of eyes whose vision saw the same,<br />
	And freely granted beauty&rsquo;s claim<br />
	Where others found but worthless wastes.</p>
<p>
	We paused to hear the far bells ringing<br />
	Across the distance, sweet and clear.<br />
	We listened to the wild bird&rsquo;s singing<br />
	The song he meant for his mate&rsquo;s ear,<br />
	And deemed our chance to do so dear.<br />
	We loved to watch the warrior Sun,<br />
	With flaming shield and flaunting crest,<br />
	Go striding down the gory West,<br />
	When Day&rsquo;s long fight was fought and won.</p>
<p>
	And life became a different story;<br />
	Where&rsquo;er I looked, I saw new light.<br />
	Earth&rsquo;s self assumed a greater glory,<br />
	Mine eyes were cleared to fuller sight.<br />
	Then first I saw the need and might<br />
	Of that fair band, the singing throng,<br />
	Who, gifted with the skill divine,<br />
	Take up the threads of life, spun fine,<br />
	And weave them into soulful song.</p>
<p>
	They sung for me, whose passion pressing<br />
	My soul, found vent in song nor line.<br />
	They bore the burden of expressing<br />
	All that I felt, with art&rsquo;s design,<br />
	And every word of theirs was mine.<br />
	I read them to Ione, ofttimes,<br />
	By hill and shore, beneath fair skies,<br />
	And she looked deeply in mine eyes,<br />
	And knew my love spoke through their rhymes.</p>
<p>
	Her life was like the stream that floweth,<br />
	And mine was like the waiting sea;<br />
	Her love was like the flower that bloweth,<br />
	And mine was like the searching bee&mdash;<br />
	I found her sweetness all for me.<br />
	God plied him in the mint of time,<br />
	And coined for us a golden day,<br />
	And rolled it ringing down life&rsquo;s way<br />
	With love&rsquo;s sweet music in its chime.</p>
<p>
	And God unclasped the Book of Ages,<br />
	And laid it open to our sight;<br />
	Upon the dimness of its pages,<br />
	So long consigned to rayless night,<br />
	He shed the glory of his light.<br />
	We read them well, we read them long,<br />
	And ever thrilling did we see<br />
	That love ruled all humanity,&mdash;<br />
	The master passion, pure and strong.</p>
<p>
	III</p>
<p>
	Ah, yes, &lsquo;t is sweet still to remember,<br />
	Though &lsquo;twere less painful to forget;<br />
	For while my heart glows like an ember,<br />

	Across the distance, sweet and clear.<br />
	We listened to the wild bird&rsquo;s singing<br />
	The song he meant for his mate&rsquo;s ear,<br />
	And deemed our chance to do so dear.<br />
	We loved to watch the warrior Sun,<br />
	With flaming shield and flaunting crest,<br />
	Go striding down the gory West,<br />
	When Day&rsquo;s long fight was fought and won.</p>
<p>
	And life became a different story;<br />
	Where&rsquo;er I looked, I saw new light.<br />
	Earth&rsquo;s self assumed a greater glory,<br />
	Mine eyes were cleared to fuller sight.<br />
	Then first I saw the need and might<br />
	Of that fair band, the singing throng,<br />
	Who, gifted with the skill divine,<br />
	Take up the threads of life, spun fine,<br />
	And weave them into soulful song.</p>
<p>
	They sung for me, whose passion pressing<br />
	My soul, found vent in song nor line.<br />
	They bore the burden of expressing<br />
	All that I felt, with art&rsquo;s design,<br />
	And every word of theirs was mine.<br />
	I read them to Ione, ofttimes,<br />
	By hill and shore, beneath fair skies,<br />
	And she looked deeply in mine eyes,<br />
	And knew my love spoke through their rhymes.</p>
<p>
	Her life was like the stream that floweth,<br />
	And mine was like the waiting sea;<br />
	Her love was like the flower that bloweth,<br />
	And mine was like the searching bee&mdash;<br />
	I found her sweetness all for me.<br />
	God plied him in the mint of time,<br />
	And coined for us a golden day,<br />
	And rolled it ringing down life&rsquo;s way<br />
	With love&rsquo;s sweet music in its chime.</p>
<p>
	And God unclasped the Book of Ages,<br />
	And laid it open to our sight;<br />
	Upon the dimness of its pages,<br />
	So long consigned to rayless night,<br />
	He shed the glory of his light.<br />
	We read them well, we read them long,<br />
	And ever thrilling did we see<br />
	That love ruled all humanity,&mdash;<br />
	The master passion, pure and strong.</p>
<p>
	III</p>
<p>
	To&ndash;day my skies are bare and ashen,<br />
	And bend on me without a beam.<br />
	Since love is held the master&ndash;passion,<br />
	Its loss must be the pain supreme&mdash;<br />
	And grinning Fate has wrecked my dream.<br />
	But pardon, dear departed Guest,<br />
	I will not rant, I will not rail;<br />
	For good the grain must feel the flail;<br />
	There are whom love has never blessed.</p>
<p>
	I had and have a younger brother,<br />
	One whom I loved and love to&ndash;day<br />
	As never fond and doting mother<br />
	Adored the babe who found its way<br />
	From heavenly scenes into her day.<br />
	Oh, he was full of youth&rsquo;s new wine,&mdash;<br />
	A man on life&rsquo;s ascending slope,<br />
	Flushed with ambition, full of hope;<br />
	And every wish of his was mine.</p>
<p>
	A kingly youth; the way before him<br />
	Was thronged with victories to be won;<br />
	So joyous, too, the heavens o&rsquo;er him<br />
	Were bright with an unchanging sun,&mdash;<br />
	His days with rhyme were overrun.<br />
	Toil had not taught him Nature&rsquo;s prose,<br />
	Tears had not dimmed his brilliant eyes,<br />
	And sorrow had not made him wise;<br />
	His life was in the budding rose.</p>
<p>
	I know not how I came to waken,<br />
	Some instinct pricked my soul to sight;<br />
	My heart by some vague thrill was shaken,&mdash;<br />
	A thrill so true and yet so slight,<br />
	I hardly deemed I read aright.<br />
	As when a sleeper, ign&rsquo;rant why,<br />
	Not knowing what mysterious hand<br />
	Has called him out of slumberland,<br />
	Starts up to find some danger nigh.</p>
<p>
	Love is a guest that comes, unbidden,<br />
	But, having come, asserts his right;<br />
	He will not be repressed nor hidden.<br />
	And so my brother&rsquo;s dawning plight<br />
	Became uncovered to my sight.<br />
	Some sound&ndash;mote in his passing tone<br />
	Caught in the meshes of my ear;<br />
	Some little glance, a shade too dear,<br />
	Betrayed the love he bore Ione.</p>
<p>
	What could I do? He was my brother,<br />
	And young, and full of hope and trust;<br />
	I could not, dared not try to smother<br />
	His flame, and turn his heart to dust.<br />
	I knew how oft life gives a crust<br />
	To starving men who cry for bread;<br />
	But he was young, so few his days,<br />
	He had not learned the great world&rsquo;s ways,<br />
	Nor Disappointment&rsquo;s volumes read.</p>
<p>
	However fair and rich the booty,<br />
	I could not make his loss my gain.<br />
	For love is dear, but dearer duty,<br />
	And here my way was clear and plain.<br />
	I saw how I could save him pain.<br />
	And so, with all my day grown dim,<br />
	That this loved brother&rsquo;s sun might shine,<br />
	I joined his suit, gave over mine,<br />
	And sought Ione, to plead for him.</p>
<p>
	I found her in an eastern bower,<br />
	Where all day long the am&rsquo;rous sun<br />
	Lay by to woo a timid flower.<br />
	This day his course was well&ndash;nigh run,<br />
	But still with lingering art he spun<br />
	Gold fancies on the shadowed wall.<br />
	The vines waved soft and green above,<br />
	And there where one might tell his love,<br />
	I told my griefs&mdash;I told her all!</p>
<p>
	I told her all, and as she hearkened,<br />
	A tear&ndash;drop fell upon her dress.<br />
	With grief her flushing brow was darkened;<br />
	One sob that she could not repress<br />
	Betrayed the depths of her distress.<br />
	Upon her grief my sorrow fed,<br />
	And I was bowed with unlived years,<br />
	My heart swelled with a sea of tears,<br />
	The tears my manhood could not shed.</p>
<p>
	The world is Rome, and Fate is Nero,<br />
	Disporting in the hour of doom.<br />
	God made us men; times make the hero&mdash;<br />
	But in that awful space of gloom<br />
	I gave no thought but sorrow&rsquo;s room.<br />
	All&mdash;all was dim within that bower,<br />
	What time the sun divorced the day;<br />
	And all the shadows, glooming gray,<br />
	Proclaimed the sadness of the hour.</p>
<p>
	She could not speak&mdash;no word was needed;<br />
	Her look, half strength and half despair,<br />
	Told me I had not vainly pleaded,<br />
	That she would not ignore my prayer.<br />
	And so she turned and left me there,<br />
	And as she went, so passed my bliss;<br />
	She loved me, I could not mistake&mdash;<br />
	But for her own and my love&rsquo;s sake,<br />
	Her womanhood could rise to this!</p>
<p>
	My wounded heart fled swift to cover,<br />
	And life at times seemed very drear.<br />
	My brother proved an ardent lover&mdash;<br />
	What had so young a man to fear?<br />
	He wed Ione within the year.<br />
	No shadow clouds her tranquil brow,<br />
	Men speak her husband&rsquo;s name with pride,<br />
	While she sits honored at his side&mdash;<br />
	She is&mdash;she must be happy now!</p>
<p>
	I doubt the course I took no longer,<br />
	Since those I love seem satisfied.<br />
	The bond between them will grow stronger<br />
	As they go forward side by side;<br />
	Then will my pains be jusfied.<br />
	Their joy is mine, and that is best&mdash;<br />
	I am not totally bereft;<br />
	For I have still the mem&rsquo;ry left&mdash;<br />
	Love stopped with me&mdash;a Royal Guest!</p>
