                <p>
	IT would be difficult to describe the subtle brotherhood of men that was here established on the seas. No one said that it was so. No one mentioned it. But it dwelt in the boat, and each man felt it warm him. They were a captain, an oiler, a cook, and a correspondent, and they were friends, friends in a more curiously iron-bound degree than may be common. The hurt captain, lying against the water-jar in the bow, spoke always in a low voice and calmly, but he could never command a more ready and swiftly obedient crew than the motley three of the dingey. It was more than a mere recognition of what was best for the common safety. There was surely in it a quality that was personal and heartfelt. And after this devotion to the commander of the boat there was this comradeship that the correspondent, for instance, who had been taught to be cynical of men, knew even at the time was the best experience of his life. But no one said that it was so. No one mentioned it.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I wish we had a sail,&rdquo; remarked the captain. &ldquo;We might try my overcoat on the end of an oar and give you two boys a chance to rest.&rdquo; So the cook and the correspondent held the mast and spread wide the overcoat. The oiler steered, and the little boat made good way with her new rig. Sometimes the oiler had to scull sharply to keep a sea from breaking into the boat, but otherwise sailing was a success.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile the light-house had been growing slowly larger. It had now almost assumed color, and appeared like a little gray shadow on the sky. The man at the oars could not be prevented from turning his head rather often to try for a glimpse of this little gray shadow.</p>
<p>
	At last, from the top of each wave the men in the tossing boat could see land. Even as the light-house was an upright shadow on the sky, this land seemed but a long black shadow on the sea. It certainly was thinner than paper. &ldquo;We must be about opposite New Smyrna,&rdquo; said the cook, who had coasted this shore often in schooners. &ldquo;Captain, by the way, I believe they abandoned that life-saving station there about a year ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Did they?&rdquo; said the captain.</p>
<p>
	The wind slowly died away. The cook and the correspondent were not now obliged to slave in order to hold high the oar. But the waves continued their old impetuous swooping at the dingey, and the little craft, no longer under way, struggled woundily over them. The oiler or the correspondent took the oars again.</p>
<p>
	Shipwrecks are apropos of nothing. If men could only train for them and have them occur when the men had reached pink condition, there would be less drowning at sea. Of the four in the dingey none had slept any time worth mentioning for two days and two nights previous to embarking in the dingey, and in the excitement of clambering about the deck of a foundering ship they had also forgotten to eat heartily.</p>
<p>
	For these reasons, and for others, neither the oiler nor the correspondent was fond of rowing at this time. The correspondent wondered ingenuously how in the name of all that was sane could there be people who thought it amusing to row a boat. It was not an amusement; it was a diabolical punishment, and even a genius of mental aberrations could never conclude that it was anything but a horror to the muscles and a crime against the back. He mentioned to the boat in general how the amusement of rowing struck him, and the weary-faced oiler smiled in full sympathy. Previously to the foundering, by the way, the oiler had worked double-watch in the engine-room of the ship.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Take her easy, now, boys,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spend yourselves. If we have to run a surf you&rsquo;ll need all your strength, because we&rsquo;ll sure have to swim for it. Take your time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Slowly the land arose from the sea. From a black line it became a line of black and a line of white, trees, and sand. Finally, the captain said that he could make out a house on the shore. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the house of refuge, sure,&rdquo; said the cook. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll see us before long, and come out after us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The distant light-house reared high. &ldquo;The keeper ought to be able to make us out now, if he&rsquo;s looking through a glass,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll notify the life-saving people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;None of those other boats could have got ashore to give word of the wreck,&rdquo; said the oiler, in a low voice. &ldquo;Else the life-boat would be out hunting us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Slowly and beautifully the land loomed out of the sea. The wind came again. It had veered from the northeast to the southeast. Finally, a new sound struck the ears of the men in the boat. It was the low thunder of the surf on the shore. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never be able to make the light-house now,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Swing her head a little more north, Billie,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;&lsquo;A little more north,&rsquo; sir,&rdquo; said the oiler.</p>
<p>
	Whereupon the little boat turned her nose once more down the wind, and all but the oarsman watched the shore grow. Under the influence of this expansion doubt and direful apprehension was leaving the minds of the men. The management of the boat was still most absorbing, but it could not prevent a quiet cheerfulness. In an hour, perhaps, they would be ashore.</p>
<p>
	Their back-bones had become thoroughly used to balancing in the boat and they now rode this wild colt of a dingey like circus men. The correspondent thought that he had been drenched to the skin, but happening to feel in the top pocket of his coat, he found therein eight cigars. Four of them were soaked with sea-water; four were perfectly scatheless. After a search, somebody produced three dry matches, and thereupon the four waifs rode in their little boat, and with an assurance of an impending rescue shining in their eyes, puffed at the big cigars and judged well and ill of all men. Everybody took a drink of water.</p>
