	<em>Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</em> is a work of children&rsquo;s literature by the English mathematician and author, Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, written under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit-hole into a fantasy realm populated by talking playing cards and anthropomorphic creatures. The tale is fraught with satirical allusions to Dodgson&rsquo;s friends and to the lessons that British schoolchildren were expected to memorize. The Wonderland described in the tale plays with logic in ways that has made the story of lasting popularity with children as well as adults. The book is often referred to by the abbreviated title <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. This alternate title was popularized by the numerous film and television adaptations of the story produced over the years. Some printings of this title contain both <em>Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</em> and its sequel <em>Through the Looking-Glass</em>, and <em>What Alice Found There</em>.</p>

	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is set in the 1840&#39;s in the fictitious town of St. Petersburg, Missouri, where Tom lives with his deceased mother&#39;s sister, Aunt Polly, and his half-brother, Sid. After Tom plays hooky from school, he is made to whitewash Aunt Polly&#39;s fence as punishment, but persuades his friends to do it for him.</p>
<p>
	Tom&#39;s real trouble begins when he and Huck Finn witness a murder committed by Injun Joe. They swear to never tell, and the wrong man, Muff Potter, is accused of the crime. Tom, Huck, and a friend run away to be pirates, but become aware that the whole town is searching for their bodies. Each of the boys make an appearance at their own funerals, where they are greeted with open arms. As Muff Potter&#39;s trial begins, Tom is overcome with guilt and testifies against Injun Joe, who quickly flees the courtroom.</p>
<p>
	Later, on a class field trip to a cave, Tom and his love interest, Becky Thatcher, get lost. As they run out of food and candles searching for a way out, Tom and Becky come upon Injun Joe, who is using the cave as a hideout. Tom finds a way out just as the search party is giving up. The town rejoices and Judge Thatcher, Becky&#39;s father, has the cave sealed, unknowingly trapping Injun Joe inside where he starves to death.</p>            </article>
