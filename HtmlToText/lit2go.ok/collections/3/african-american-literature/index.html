      African-American Literature is the sub-category of American Literature that includes work produced in the United States by writers of African descent and directly pertains to the experiences and viewpoints of African-Americans. In this collection, we also include works by authors such as Harriet Beecher Stowe. While not an African-American, Stowe's work attempted to depict the lives of African-Americans living under slavery. Work such as this had a profound effect on public attitudes toward African-Americans and slavery in the United States.    </p>

	William Wells Brown was a prominent abolitionist lecturer, novelist, playwright, and historian. Born into slavery in the Southern United States, Brown escaped to the North, where he worked for abolitionist causes and was a prolific writer. Brown was a pioneer in several different literary genres, including travel writing, fiction, and drama, and wrote what is considered to be the first novel by an African American. An almost exact contemporary of Frederick Douglass, Wells Brown was overshadowed by Douglass and the two feuded publicly.</p>          </article>

He was a firm believer in the equality of all people, whether black, female, Native American, or recent immigrant.

            <p>
	Jubilee Singers of Fisk University were a group of African American singers in the 1870s. Their repertoire centered on spirituals, but also included some Stephen Foster songs. The word &quot;jubilee&quot; was originally intended to set them apart from blackface minstrels, but was soon adopted in the names of several minstrel troupes.</p>
<p>
	The singers were a fundraising effort for Fisk University, a historically black university in Nashville, Tennessee, although one that was not initially approved by the university itself. The treasurer at Fisk at that time was George L. White. In an effort to raise money for the University, he gathered a nine-member chorus of students to go on tour in an attempt to earn money. On October 6, 1871, the group of students left for their U.S. tour. They began in small towns, some of which were not receptive to their performances.</p>
<p>
	Soon, the audiences they performed for began to appreciate their beautiful voices and they began to receive praise for their talents. Prior to the formation of this group, most black music was being performed by white musicians and it took a while for audiences to accept the talent of The Jubilee Singers as a group of black performers. Eventually, they were able to earn enough money to send back to Fisk University to help cover some expenses. Near the end of 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant invited them to perform at The White House.</p>
<p>
	After a tour of Europe in 1873, the group earned enough money to send back to Fisk to construct the university&#39;s first-ever permanent building. The building was named Jubilee Hall, and it is still standing today.</p>          </article>

	Elizabeth Hobbs Keckley was a former slave turned successful seamstress who is most notably known as being Mary Todd Lincoln&#39;s personal modiste and confidante, and the author of her autobiography, Behind the Scenes Or, Thirty Years a Slave and Four Years in the White House. Mrs. Keckley utilized her intelligence, keen business savvy, and sewing and design skills to arrange and ultimately buy her freedom (and that of her son George as well), and later enjoyed regular business with the wives of the government elite as her base clientele.</p>
<p>
	After several years in St. Louis, she moved to Washington, D.C. in the spring of 1860, where she had the country&#39;s most elite women of the time requesting her services. Through shrewd networking and hard work, she ended up making gowns and dresses for more notable wives such as Mrs. Varina Davis, wife of Jefferson Davis, and Mrs. Mary Anne Randolph Custis Lee, wife of Robert E. Lee. Of all her clients, she had the closest and most long-standing relationship with Mary Todd Lincoln, devoting many of her days during Abraham Lincoln&#39;s administration to being available to her and the First Family in a myriad of ways.</p>          </article>

	Booker Taliaferro Washington (April 5, 1856 - November 14, 1915) was an American educator, author and leader of the African American community. He was freed from slavery as a child, gained an education, and as a young man was appointed to lead a teachers&rsquo; college for black Americans. From this position of leadership he rose into a nationally prominent role as spokesman for his race. He was a pragmatist and an accommodationist, and as such won friends in high places who helped him further his agenda of education for African Americans.</p>          </article>

	Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly is an anti&ndash;slavery novel by American author Harriet Beecher Stowe. Published in 1852, the novel had a profound effect on attitudes towards slavery in the United States. The book also helped create a number of stereotypes of African-Americans. To some extent, this negative effect has overshadowed other historical impacts of the novel.</p>
<p>
	The Told to the Children Series of books were published in Great Britain in the early 1900&#39;s. The purpose of the book series was to introduce readers between the ages of 9 and 12 to the best known classic novels of the 19th Century.</p>            </article>

	Clotel; or, The President&#39;s Daughter is a novel by William Wells Brown (1815 &ndash; 1884), a fugitive from slavery and abolitionist and was published in London, England in December 1853. It gained notoriety amid the unconfirmed rumors regarding Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings. Brown was still considered someone else&#39;s legal property within the borders of the United States at the time of its publication. It is considered to be the first novel written by an African American. The book follows the experiences of three generations of women during slavery.</p>
<p>
	Brown used the injustices of slavery to demonstrate the destructive effects it had on the African American family, most significantly the so&ndash;called tragic mulatto. Brown had escaped from slavery in Kentucky while still in his youth, and became active on the anti&ndash;slavery circuit.</p>            </article>
