      From the late 1800s through the mid-1900s, the Stratemeyer Syndicate, founded by Edward Stratemeyer, published several different book series for young readers, including <em>The Bobbsey Twins</em>, <em>Outdoor Chums</em>, <em>Kneetime Animal Stories</em>, <em>The Rover Boys</em>, and <em>Tom Swift</em>. The Syndicate was the first book packager of books written for children. Each series was written by a number of different authors under a single pseudonym. The Syndicate hired the authors and gave them guidelines for the characters and plots for each series.    </p>
