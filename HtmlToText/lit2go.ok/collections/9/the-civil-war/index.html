	Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly is an anti&ndash;slavery novel by American author Harriet Beecher Stowe. Published in 1852, the novel had a profound effect on attitudes towards slavery in the United States. The book also helped create a number of stereotypes of African-Americans. To some extent, this negative effect has overshadowed other historical impacts of the novel.</p>
<p>
	The Told to the Children Series of books were published in Great Britain in the early 1900&#39;s. The purpose of the book series was to introduce readers between the ages of 9 and 12 to the best known classic novels of the 19th Century.</p>            </article>

              <p>
	<em>The Red Badge of Courage</em> is an impressionistic novel by Stephen Crane about the meaning of courage, as it is narrated by Henry Fleming, a recruit in the American Civil War. It is one of the most influential American war stories ever written even though the author was born after the war and had never seen battle himself. Crane met and spoke with a number of veterans as a student and he created what is widely regarded as an unusually realistic depiction of a young man in battle.</p>            </article>

	The Emancipation Proclamation consists of two executive orders issued by United States President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War. The first one, issued September 22, 1862, declared the freedom of all slaves in any state of the Confederate States of America that did not return to Union control by January 1, 1863. The second order, issued January 1, 1863, named ten specific states where it would apply. Lincoln issued the Executive Order by his authority as &quot;Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy&quot; under Article II, section 2 of the United States Constitution.</p>          </article>
