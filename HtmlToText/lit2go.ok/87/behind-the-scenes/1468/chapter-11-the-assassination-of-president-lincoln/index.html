                <p>
	I had never heard Mr. Lincoln make a public speech, and, knowing the man so well, was very anxious to hear him. On the morning of the Tuesday after our return from City Point, Mrs. Lincoln came to my apartments, and before she drove away I asked permission to come to the White House that night and hear Mr. Lincoln speak.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Certainly, Lizabeth; if you take any interest in political speeches, come and listen in welcome.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Thank you, Mrs. Lincoln. May I trespass further on your kindness by asking permission to bring a friend with me?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Yes, bring your friend also. By the way, come in time to dress me before the speaking commences.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I will be in time. You may rely upon that. Good morning,&quot; I added, as she swept from my room, and, passing out into the street, entered her carriage and drove away.</p>
<p>
	About 7 o&#39;clock that evening I entered the White House. As I went up&ndash;stairs I glanced into Mr. Lincoln&#39;s room through the half&ndash;open door, and seated by a desk was the President, looking over his notes and muttering to himself. His face was thoughtful, his manner abstracted, and I knew, as I paused a moment to watch him, that he was rehearsing the part that he was to play in the great drama soon to commence.</p>
<p>
	Proceeding to Mrs. Lincoln&#39;s apartment, I worked with busy fingers, and in a short time her toilette was completed.</p>
<p>
	Great crowds began to gather in front of the White House, and loud calls were made for the President. The band stopped playing, and as he advanced to the centre window over the door to make his address, I looked out, and never saw such a mass of heads before. It was like a black, gently swelling sea. The swaying motion of the crowd, in the dim uncertain light, was like the rising and falling of billows&mdash;like the ebb and flow of the tide upon the stranded shore of the ocean. Close to the house the faces were plainly discernible, but they faded into mere ghostly outlines on the outskirts of the assembly; and what added to the weird, spectral beauty of the scene, was the confused hum of voices that rose above the sea of forms, sounding like the subdued, sullen roar of an ocean storm, or the wind soughing through the dark lonely forest. It was a grand and imposing scene, and when the President, with pale face and his soul flashing through his eyes, advanced to speak, he looked more like a demigod than a man crowned with the fleeting days of mortality.</p>
<p>
	The moment the President appeared at the window he was greeted with a storm of applause, and voices re&ndash;echoed the cry, &quot;A light! a light!&quot;</p>
<p>
	A lamp was brought, and little Tad at once rushed to his father&#39;s side, exclaiming:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Let me hold the light, Papa! let me hold the light!&quot;</p>
<p>
	Mrs. Lincoln directed that the wish of her son be gratified, and the lamp was transferred to his hands. The father and son standing there in the presence of thousands of free citizens, the one lost in a chain of eloquent ideas, the other looking up into the speaking face with a proud, manly look, formed a beautiful and striking tableau.</p>
<p>
	There were a number of distinguished gentlemen, as well as ladies, in the room, nearly all of whom remarked the picture.</p>
<p>
	I stood a short distance from Mr. Lincoln, and as the light from the lamp fell full upon him, making him stand out boldly in the darkness, a sudden thought struck me, and I whispered to the friend at my side:</p>
<p>
	&quot;What an easy matter would it be to kill the President, as he stands there! He could be shot down from the crowd, and no one be able to tell who fired the shot.&quot;</p>
<p>
	I do not know what put such an idea into my head, unless it was the sudden remembrance of the many warnings that Mr. Lincoln had received.</p>
<p>
	The next day, I made mention to Mrs. Lincoln of the idea that had impressed me so strangely the night before, and she replied with a sigh:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Yes, yes, Mr. Lincoln&#39;s life is always exposed. Ah, no one knows what it is to live in constant dread of some fearful tragedy. The President has been warned so often, that I tremble for him on every public occasion. I have a presentiment that he will meet with a sudden and violent end. I pray God to protect my beloved husband from the hands of the assassin.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Mr. Lincoln was fond of pets. He had two goats that knew the sound of his voice, and when he called them they would come bounding to his side. In the warm bright days, he and Tad would sometimes play in the yard with these goats, for an hour at a time. One Saturday afternoon I went to the White House to dress Mrs. Lincoln. I had nearly completed my task when the President came in. It was a bright day, and walking to the window, he looked down into the yard, smiled, and, turning to me, asked:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Madam Elizabeth, you are fond of pets, are you not?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;O yes, sir,&quot; I answered.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Well, come here and look at my two goats. I believe they are the kindest and best goats in the world. See how they sniff the clear air, and skip and play in the sunshine. Whew! what a jump,&quot; he exclaimed as one of the goats made a lofty spring. &quot;Madam Elizabeth, did you ever before see such an active goat?&quot; Musing a moment, he continued: &quot;He feeds on my bounty, and jumps with joy. Do you think we could call him a bounty&ndash;jumper? But I flatter the bounty&ndash;jumper. My goat is far above him. I would rather wear his horns and hairy coat through life, than demean myself to the level of the man who plunders the national treasury in the name of patriotism. The man who enlists into the service for a consideration, and deserts the moment he receives his money but to repeat the play, is bad enough; but the men who manipulate the grand machine and who simply make the bounty&ndash;jumper their agent in an outrageous fraud are far worse. They are beneath the worms that crawl in the dark hidden places of earth.&quot;</p>
<p>
	His lips curled with haughty scorn, and a cloud was gathering on his brow. Only a moment the shadow rested on his face. Just then both goats looked up at the window and shook their heads as if they would say &quot;How d&#39;ye do, old friend?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;See, Madam Elizabeth,&quot; exclaimed the President in a tone of enthusiasm, &quot;my pets recognize me. How earnestly they look! There they go again; what jolly fun!&quot; and he laughed outright as the goats bounded swiftly to the other side of the yard. Just then Mrs. Lincoln called out, &quot;Come, Lizabeth; if I get ready to go down this evening I must finish dressing myself, or you must stop staring at those silly goats.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Mrs. Lincoln was not fond of pets, and she could not understand how Mr. Lincoln could take so much delight in his goats. After Willie&#39;s death, she could not bear the sight of anything he loved, not even a flower. Costly bouquets were presented to her, but she turned from them with a shudder, and either placed them in a room where she could not see them, or threw them out of the window. She gave all of Willie&#39;s toys&mdash;everything connected with him&mdash;away, as she said she could not look upon them without thinking of her poor dead boy, and to think of him, in his white shroud and cold grave, was maddening. I never in my life saw a more peculiarly constituted woman. Search the world over, and you will not find her counterpart. After Mr. Lincoln&#39;s death, the goats that he loved so well were given away&mdash;I believe to Mrs. Lee, n&eacute;e Miss Blair, one of the few ladies with whom Mrs. Lincoln was on intimate terms in Washington.</p>
<p>
	During my residence in the Capital I made my home with Mr. and Mrs. Walker Lewis, people of my own race, and friends in the truest sense of the word.</p>
<p>
	The days passed without any incident of particular note disturbing the current of life. On Friday morning, April 14th&mdash;alas! what American does not remember the day&mdash;I saw Mrs. Lincoln but for a moment. She told me that she was to attend the theatre that night with the President, but I was not summoned to assist her in making her toilette. Sherman had swept from the northern border of Georgia through the heart of the Confederacy down to the sea, striking the death&ndash;blow to the rebellion. Grant had pursued General Lee beyond Richmond, and the army of Virginia, that had made such stubborn resistance, was crumbling to pieces. Fort Sumter had fallen;&mdash;the stronghold first wrenched from the Union; and which had braved the fury of Federal guns for so many years, was restored to the Union; the end of the war was near at hand, and the great pulse of the loyal North thrilled with joy. The dark war&ndash;cloud was fading, and a white&ndash;robed angel seemed to hover in the sky, whispering &quot;Peace&mdash;peace on earth, good&ndash;will toward men!&quot; Sons, brothers, fathers, friends, sweethearts were coming home. Soon the white tents would be folded, the volunteer army be disbanded, and tranquillity again reign. Happy, happy day!&mdash;happy at least to those who fought under the banner of the Union. There was great rejoicing throughout the North. From the Atlantic to the Pacific, flags were gayly thrown to the breeze, and at night every city blazed with its tens of thousand lights. But scarcely had the fireworks ceased to play, and the lights been taken down from the windows, when the lightning flashed the most appalling news over the magnetic wires. &quot;The President has been murdered!&quot; spoke the swift&ndash;winged messenger, and the loud huzza died upon the lips. A nation suddenly paused in the midst of festivity, and stood paralyzed with horror&mdash;transfixed with awe.</p>
<p>
	Oh, memorable day! Oh, memorable night! Never before was joy so violently contrasted with sorrow.</p>
<p>
	At 11 o&#39;clock at night I was awakened by an old friend and neighbor, Miss M. Brown, with the startling intelligence that the entire Cabinet had been assassinated, and Mr. Lincoln shot, but not mortally wounded. When I heard the words I felt as if the blood had been frozen in my veins, and that my lungs must collapse for the want of air. Mr. Lincoln shot! the Cabinet assassinated! What could it mean? The streets were alive with wondering, awe&ndash;stricken people. Rumors flew thick and fast, and the wildest reports came with every new arrival. The words were repeated with blanched cheeks and quivering lips. I waked Mr. and Mrs. Lewis, and told them that the President was shot, and that I must go to the White House. I could not remain in a state of uncertainty. I felt that the house would not hold me. They tried to quiet me, but gentle words could not calm the wild tempest. They quickly dressed themselves, and we sallied out into the street to drift with the excited throng. We walked rapidly towards the White House, and on our way passed the residence of Secretary Seward, which was surrounded by armed soldiers, keeping back all intruders with the point of the bayonet. We hurried on, and as we approached the White House, saw that it too was surrounded with soldiers. Every entrance was strongly guarded, and no one was permitted to pass. The guard at the gate told us that Mr. Lincoln had not been brought home, but refused to give any other information. More excited than ever, we wandered down the street. Grief and anxiety were making me weak, and as we joined the outskirts of a large crowd, I began to feel as meek and humble as a penitent child. A gray&ndash;haired old man was passing. I caught a glimpse of his face, and it seemed so full of kindness and sorrow that I gently touched his arm, and imploringly asked:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Will you please, sir, to tell me whether Mr. Lincoln is dead or not?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Not dead,&quot; he replied, &quot;but dying. God help us!&quot; and with a heavy step he passed on.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Not dead, but dying! then indeed God help us!&quot;</p>
<p>
	We learned that the President was mortally wounded&mdash;that he had been shot down in his box at the theatre, and that he was not expected to live till morning; when we returned home with heavy hearts. I could not sleep. I wanted to go to Mrs. Lincoln, as I pictured her wild with grief; but then I did not know where to find her, and I must wait till morning. Never did the hours drag so slowly. Every moment seemed an age, and I could do nothing but walk about and hold my arms in mental agony.</p>
<p>
	Morning came at last, and a sad morning was it. The flags that floated so gayly yesterday now were draped in black, and hung in silent folds at half&ndash;mast. The President was dead, and a nation was mourning for him. Every house was draped in black, and every face wore a solemn look. People spoke in subdued tones, and glided whisperingly, wonderingly, silently about the streets.</p>
<p>
	About eleven o&#39;clock on Saturday morning a carriage drove up to the door, and a messenger asked for &quot;Elizabeth Keckley.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Who wants her?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>
	&quot;I come from Mrs. Lincoln. If you are Mrs. Keckley, come with me immediately to the White House.&quot;</p>
<p>
	I hastily put on my shawl and bonnet, and was driven at a rapid rate to the White House. Everything about the building was sad and solemn. I was quickly shown to Mrs. Lincoln&#39;s room, and on entering, saw Mrs. L. tossing uneasily about upon a bed. The room was darkened, and the only person in it besides the widow of the President was Mrs. Secretary Welles, who had spent the night with her. Bowing to Mrs. Welles, I went to the bedside.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Why did you not come to me last night, Elizabeth&mdash;I sent for you?&quot; Mrs. Lincoln asked in a low whisper.</p>
<p>
	&quot;I did try to come to you, but I could not find you,&quot; I answered, as I laid my hand upon her hot brow.</p>
<p>
	I afterwards learned, that when she had partially recovered from the first shock of the terrible tragedy in the theatre, Mrs. Welles asked:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Is there no one, Mrs. Lincoln, that you desire to have with you in this terrible affliction?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Yes, send for Elizabeth Keckley. I want her just as soon as she can be brought here.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Three messengers, it appears, were successively despatched for me, but all of them mistook the number and failed to find me.</p>
<p>
	Shortly after entering the room on Saturday morning, Mrs. Welles excused herself, as she said she must go to her own family, and I was left alone with Mrs. Lincoln.</p>
<p>
	She was nearly exhausted with grief, and when she became a little quiet, I asked and received permission to go into the Guests&#39; Room, where the body of the President lay in state. When I crossed the threshold of the room, I could not help recalling the day on which I had seen little Willie lying in his coffin where the body of his father now lay. I remembered how the President had wept over the pale beautiful face of his gifted boy, and now the President himself was dead. The last time I saw him he spoke kindly to me, but alas! the lips would never move again. The light had faded from his eyes, and when the light went out the soul went with it. What a noble soul was his&mdash;noble in all the noble attributes of God! Never did I enter the solemn chamber of death with such palpitating heart and trembling footsteps as I entered it that day. No common mortal had died. The Moses of my people had fallen in the hour of his triumph. Fame had woven her choicest chaplet for his brow. Though the brow was cold and pale in death, the chaplet should not fade, for God had studded it with the glory of the eternal stars.</p>
<p>
	When I entered the room, the members of the Cabinet and many distinguished officers of the army were grouped around the body of their fallen chief. They made room for me, and, approaching the body, I lifted the white cloth from the white face of the man that I had worshipped as an idol&mdash;looked upon as a demi&ndash;god. Notwithstanding the violence of the death of the President, there was something beautiful as well as grandly solemn in the expression of the placid face. There lurked the sweetness and gentleness of childhood, and the stately grandeur of godlike intellect. I gazed long at the face, and turned away with tears in my eyes and a choking sensation in my throat. Ah! never was man so widely mourned before. The whole world bowed their heads in grief when Abraham Lincoln died.</p>
<p>
	Returning to Mrs. Lincoln&#39;s room, I found her in a new paroxysm of grief. Robert was bending over his mother with tender affection, and little Tad was crouched at the foot of the bed with a world of agony in his young face. I shall never forget the scene&mdash;the wails of a broken heart, the unearthly shrieks, the terrible convulsions, the wild, tempestuous outbursts of grief from the soul. I bathed Mrs. Lincoln&#39;s head with cold water, and soothed the terrible tornado as best I could. Tad&#39;s grief at his father&#39;s death was as great as the grief of his mother, but her terrible outbursts awed the boy into silence. Sometimes he would throw his arms around her neck, and exclaim, between his broken sobs, &quot;Don&#39;t cry so, Mamma! don&#39;t cry, or you will make me cry, too! You will break my heart.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Mrs. Lincoln could not bear to hear Tad cry, and when he would plead to her not to break his heart, she would calm herself with a great effort, and clasp her child in her arms.</p>
<p>
	Every room in the White House was darkened, and every one spoke in subdued tones, and moved about with muffled tread. The very atmosphere breathed of the great sorrow which weighed heavily upon each heart. Mrs. Lincoln never left her room, and while the body of her husband was being borne in solemn state from the Atlantic to the broad prairies of the West, she was weeping with her fatherless children in her private chamber. She denied admittance to almost every one, and I was her only companion, except her children, in the days of her great sorrow.</p>
<p>
	There were many surmises as to who was implicated with J. Wilkes Booth in the assassination of the President. A new messenger had accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln to the theatre on that terrible Friday night. It was the duty of this messenger to stand at the door of the box during the performance, and thus guard the inmates from all intrusion. It appears that the messenger was carried away by the play, and so neglected his duty that Booth gained easy admission to the box. Mrs. Lincoln firmly believed that this messenger was implicated in the assassination plot.</p>
<p>
	One night I was lying on a lounge near the bed occupied by Mrs. Lincoln. One of the servants entering the room, Mrs. L. asked:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Who is on watch to&ndash;night?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;The new messenger,&quot; was the reply.</p>
<p>
	&quot;What! the man who attended us to the theatre on the night my dear, good husband was murdered! He, I believe, is one of the murderers. Tell him to come in to me.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The messenger had overheard Mrs. Lincoln&#39;s words through the half&ndash;open door, and when he came in he was trembling violently.</p>
<p>
	She turned to him fiercely: &quot;So you are on guard to&ndash;night&mdash;on guard in the White House after helping to murder the President!&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Pardon me, but I did not help to murder the President. I could never stoop to murder&mdash;much less to the murder of so good and great a man as the President.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;But it appears that you did stoop to murder.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;No, no! don&#39;t say that,&quot; he broke in. &quot;God knows that I am innocent.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I don&#39;t believe you. Why were you not at the door to keep the assassin out when he rushed into the box?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I did wrong, I admit, and I have bitterly repented it, but I did not help to kill the President. I did not believe that any one would try to kill so good a man in such a public place, and the belief made me careless. I was attracted by the play, and did not see the assassin enter the box.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;But you should have seen him. You had no business to be careless. I shall always believe that you are guilty. Hush! I shan&#39;t hear another word,&quot; she exclaimed, as the messenger essayed to reply. &quot;Go now and keep your watch,&quot; she added, with an imperious wave of her hand. With mechanical step and white face the messenger left the room, and Mrs. Lincoln fell back on her pillow, covered her face with her hands, and commenced sobbing.</p>
<p>
	Robert was very tender to his mother in the days of her sorrow.</p>
<p>
	He suffered deeply, as his haggard face indicated, but he was ever manly and collected when in the presence of his mother. Mrs. Lincoln was extremely nervous, and she refused to have anybody about her but myself. Many ladies called, but she received none of them. Had she been less secluded in her grief, perhaps she would have had many warmer friends to&ndash;day than she has. But far be it from me to harshly judge the sorrow of any one. Could the ladies who called to condole with Mrs. Lincoln, after the death of her husband, and who were denied admittance to her chamber, have seen how completely prostrated she was with grief, they would have learned to speak more kindly of her. Often at night, when Tad would hear her sobbing, he would get up, and come to her bed in his white sleeping&ndash;clothes: &quot;Don&#39;t cry, Mamma; I cannot sleep if you cry! Papa was good, and he has gone to heaven. He is happy there. He is with God and brother Willie. Don&#39;t cry, Mamma, or I will cry too.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The closing appeal always proved the most effectual, as Mrs. Lincoln could not bear to hear her child cry.</p>
<p>
	Tad had been petted by his father, but petting could not spoil such a manly nature as his. He seemed to realize that he was the son of a President&mdash;to realize it in its loftiest and noblest sense. One morning, while being dressed, he looked up at his nurse, and said: &quot;Pa is dead. I can hardly believe that I shall never see him again. I must learn to take care of myself now.&quot; He looked thoughtful a moment, then added, &quot;Yes, Pa is dead, and I am only Tad Lincoln now, little Tad, like other little boys. I am not a President&#39;s son now. I won&#39;t have many presents any more. Well, I will try and be a good boy, and will hope to go some day to Pa and brother Willie, in heaven.&quot; He was a brave, manly child, and knew that influence had passed out of their hands with the death of his father, and that his position in life was altered. He seemed to feel that people petted him, and gave him presents, because they wanted to please the President of the United States. From that period forward he became more independent, and in a short time learned to dispense with the services of a nurse. While in Chicago, I saw him get out his clothes one Sunday morning and dress himself, and the change was such a great one to me&mdash;for while in the White House, servants obeyed his every nod and bid&mdash;that I could scarcely refrain from shedding tears. Had his father lived, I knew it would have been different with his favorite boy. Tad roomed with Robert, and he always took pride in pleasing his brother.</p>
<p>
	After the Committee had started West with the body of the President, there was quite a breeze of excitement for a few days as to where the remains should be interred. Secretary Stanton and others held frequent conferences with Robert, Mr. Todd, Mrs. Lincoln&#39;s cousin, and Dr. Henry, an old schoolmate and friend of Mr. Lincoln. The city authorities of Springfield had purchased a beautiful plat of ground in a prosperous portion of the city, and work was rapidly progressing on the tomb, when Mrs. Lincoln made strenuous objection to the location. She declared that she would stop the body in Chicago before it should be laid to rest in the lot purchased for the purpose by the City of Springfield. She gave as a reason, that it was her desire to be laid by the side of her husband when she died, and that such would be out of the question in a public place of the kind. As is well known, the difficulty was finally settled by placing the remains of the President in the family vault at Oak Ridge, a charming spot for the home of the dead.</p>
<p>
	After the President&#39;s funeral Mrs. Lincoln rallied, and began to make preparations to leave the White House. One day she suddenly exclaimed: &quot;God, Elizabeth, what a change! Did ever woman have to suffer so much and experience so great a change? I had an ambition to be Mrs. President; that ambition has been gratified, and now I must step down from the pedestal. My poor husband! had he never been President, he might be living to&ndash;day. Alas! all is over with me!&quot;</p>
<p>
	Folding her arms for a few moments, she rocked back and forth, then commenced again, more vehemently than ever: &quot;My God, Elizabeth, I can never go back to Springfield! no, never, until I go in my shroud to be laid by my dear husband&#39;s side, and may Heaven speed that day! I should like to live for my sons, but life is so full of misery that I would rather die.&quot; And then she would go off into a fit of hysterics.</p>
