                <p>
	For five weeks Mrs. Lincoln was confined to her room. Packing afforded quite a relief, as it so closely occupied us that we had not much time for lamentation.</p>
<p>
	Letters of condolence were received from all parts of the country, and even from foreign potentates, but Mr. Andrew Johnson, the successor of Mr. Lincoln, never called on the widow, or even so much as wrote a line expressing sympathy for her grief and the loss of her husband. Robert called on him one day to tell him that his mother would turn the White House over to him in a few days, and he never even so much as inquired after their welfare. Mrs. Lincoln firmly believes that Mr. Johnson was concerned in the assassination plot.</p>
<p>
	In packing, Mrs. Lincoln gave away everything intimately connected with the President, as she said that she could not bear to be reminded of the past. The articles were given to those who were regarded as the warmest of Mr. Lincoln&#39;s admirers. All of the presents passed through my hands. The dress that Mrs. Lincoln wore on the night of the assassination was given to Mrs. Slade, the wife of an old and faithful messenger. The cloak, stained with the President&#39;s blood, was given to me, as also was the bonnet worn on the same memorable night. Afterwards I received the comb and brush that Mr. Lincoln used during his residence at the White House. With this same comb and brush I had often combed his head. When almost ready to go down to a reception, he would turn to me with a quizzical look: &quot;Well, Madam Elizabeth, will you brush my bristles down to&ndash;night?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Yes, Mr. Lincoln.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Then he would take his seat in an easy&ndash;chair, and sit quietly while I arranged his hair. As may well be imagined, I was only too glad to accept this comb and brush from the hands of Mrs. Lincoln. The cloak, bonnet, comb, and brush, the glove worn at the first reception after the second inaugural, and Mr. Lincoln&#39;s over&ndash;shoes, also given to me, I have since donated for the benefit of Wilberforce University, a colored college near Xenia, Ohio, destroyed by fire on the night that the President was murdered.</p>
<p>
	There was much surmise, when Mrs. Lincoln left the White House, what her fifty or sixty boxes, not to count her score of trunks, could contain. Had the government not been so liberal in furnishing the boxes, it is possible that there would have been less demand for so much transportation. The boxes were loosely packed, and many of them with articles not worth carrying away. Mrs. Lincoln had a passion for hoarding old things, believing, with Toodles, that they were &quot;handy to have about the house.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The bonnets that she brought with her from Springfield, in addition to every one purchased during her residence in Washington, were packed in the boxes, and transported to Chicago. She remarked that she might find use for the material some day, and it was prudent to look to the future. I am sorry to say that Mrs. Lincoln&#39;s foresight in regard to the future was only confined to cast&ndash;off clothing, as she owed, at the time of the President&#39;s death, different store bills amounting to seventy thousand dollars. Mr. Lincoln knew nothing of these bills, and the only happy feature of his assassination was that he died in ignorance of them. Had he known to what extent his wife was involved, the fact would have embittered the only pleasant moments of his life. I disclose this secret in regard to Mrs. Lincoln&#39;s debts, in order to explain why she should subsequently have labored under pecuniary embarrassment. The children, as well as herself, had received a vast number of presents during Mr. Lincoln&#39;s administration, and these presents constituted a large item in the contents of the boxes. The only article of furniture, so far as I know, taken away from the White House by Mrs. Lincoln, was a little dressing&ndash;stand used by the President. I recollect hearing him say one day:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Mother, this little stand is so handy, and suits me so well, that I do not know how I shall get along without it when we move away from here.&quot; He was standing before a mirror, brushing his hair, when he made the remark.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Well, father,&quot; Mrs. Lincoln replied, &quot;if you like the stand so well, we will take it with us when we go away.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Not for the world,&quot; he exclaimed; but she interrupted him:</p>
<p>
	&quot;I should like to know what difference it makes if we put a better one in its place.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;That alters the question. If you will put a stand in its place worth twice as much as this one, and the Commissioner consents, then I have no objection.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Mrs. Lincoln remembered these words, and, with the consent of the Commissioner, took the stand to Chicago with her for the benefit of little Tad. Another stand, I must not forget to add, was put in its place.</p>
<p>
	It is charged that a great deal of furniture was lost from the White House during Mr. Lincoln&#39;s occupation of it. Very true, and it can be accounted for in this way: In some respects, to put the case very plainly, Mrs. Lincoln was &quot;penny wise and pound foolish.&quot; When she moved into the White House, she discharged the Steward, whose business it was to look after the affairs of the household. When the Steward was dismissed, there was no one to superintend affairs, and the servants carried away many pieces of furniture. In this manner the furniture rapidly disappeared.</p>
<p>
	Robert was frequently in the room where the boxes were being packed, and he tried without avail to influence his mother to set fire to her vast stores of old goods. &quot;What are you going to do with that old dress, mother?&quot; he would ask.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Never mind, Robert, I will find use for it. You do not understand this business.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;And what is more, I hope I never may understand it. I wish to heaven the car would take fire in which you place these boxes for transportation to Chicago, and burn all of your old plunder up;&quot; and then, with an impatient gesture, he would turn on his heel and leave the room.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Robert is so impetuous,&quot; his mother would say to me, after the closing of the door. &quot;He never thinks about the future. Well, I hope that he will get over his boyish notions in time.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Many of the articles that Mrs. Lincoln took away from the White House were given, after her arrival in Chicago, for the benefit of charity fairs.</p>
<p>
	At last everything was packed, and the day for departure for the West came. I can never forget that day; it was so unlike the day when the body of the President was borne from the hall in grand and solemn state. Then thousands gathered to bow the head in reverence as the plumed hearse drove down the line. There was all the pomp of military display&mdash;drooping flags, battalions with reversed arms, and bands playing dirge&ndash;like airs. Now, the wife of the President was leaving the White House, and there was scarcely a friend to tell her good&ndash;by. She passed down the public stairway, entered her carriage, and quietly drove to the depot where we took the cars. The silence was almost painful.</p>
<p>
	It had been arranged that I should go to Chicago. When Mrs. Lincoln first suggested her plan, I strongly objected; but I had been with her so long, that she had acquired great power over me.</p>
<p>
	&quot;I cannot go West with you, Mrs. Lincoln,&quot; I said, when the idea was first advanced.</p>
<p>
	&quot;But you must go to Chicago with me, Elizabeth; I cannot do without you.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;You forget my business, Mrs. Lincoln. I cannot leave it. Just now I have the spring trousseau to make for Mrs. Douglas, and I have promised to have it done in less than a week.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Never mind. Mrs. Douglas can get some one else to make her trousseau. You may find it to your interest to go. I am very poor now, but if Congress makes an appropriation for my benefit, you shall be well rewarded.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;It is not the reward, but&mdash;&quot; I commenced, by way of reply, but she stopped me:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Now don&#39;t say another word about it, if you do not wish to distress me. I have determined that you shall go to Chicago with me, and you must go.&quot;</p>
<p>
	When Mrs. Douglas learned that Mrs. Lincoln wished me to accompany her West, she sent me word:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Never mind me. Do all you can for Mrs. Lincoln. My heart&#39;s sympathy is with her.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Finding that no excuse would be accepted, I made preparations to go to Chicago with Mrs. L.</p>
<p>
	The green car had specially been chartered for us, and in this we were conveyed to the West. Dr. Henry accompanied us, and he was remarkably attentive and kind. The first night out, Mrs. Lincoln had a severe headache; and while I was bathing her temples, she said to me:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Lizabeth, you are my best and kindest friend, and I love you as my best friend. I wish it were in my power to make you comfortable for the balance of your days. If Congress provides for me, depend upon it, I will provide for you.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The trip was devoid of interest. We arrived in Chicago without accident or delay, and apartments were secured for us at the Tremont House, where we remained one week. At the expiration of this time Mrs. Lincoln decided that living at the hotel was attended with too much expense, so it was arranged that we should go to the country. Rooms were selected at Hyde Park, a summer resort.</p>
<p>
	Robert and Tad accompanied their mother to Hyde Park. We arrived about 3 o&#39;clock in the afternoon of Saturday. The place had just been opened the summer before, and there was a newness about everything. The accommodations were not first&ndash;class, the rooms being small and plainly furnished. It was a lively day for us all. Robert occupied himself unpacking his books, and arranging them on the shelves in the corner of his small but neat room. I assisted him, he talking pleasantly all the while. When we were through, he folded his arms, stood off a little distance from the mantel, with an abstracted look as if he were thinking of the great change in his fortunes&mdash;contrasting the present with the past. Turning to me, he asked: &quot;Well, Mrs. Keckley, how do you like our new quarters?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;This is a delightful place, and I think you will pass your time pleasantly,&quot; I answered.</p>
<p>
	He looked at me with a quizzical smile, then remarked: &quot;You call it a delightful place! Well, perhaps it is. Since you do not have to stay here, you can safely say as much about the charming situation as you please. I presume that I must put up with it, as mother&#39;s pleasure must be consulted before my own. But candidly, I would almost as soon be dead as be compelled to remain three months in this dreary house.&quot;</p>
<p>
	He seemed to feel what he said, and going to the window, he looked out upon the view with moody countenance. I passed into Mrs. Lincoln&#39;s room, and found her lying upon the bed, sobbing as if her heart would break.</p>
<p>
	&quot;What a dreary place, Lizzie! And to think that I should be compelled to live here, because I have not the means to live elsewhere. Ah! what a sad change has come to us all.&quot; I had listened to her sobbing for eight weeks, therefore I was never surprised to find her in tears. Tad was the only cheerful one of the party. He was a child of sunshine, and nothing seemed to dampen the ardor of his spirits.</p>
<p>
	Sunday was a very quiet day. I looked out of my window in the morning, upon the beautiful lake that formed one of the most delightful views from the house. The wind was just strong enough to ripple the broad bosom of the water, and each ripple caught a jewel from the sunshine, and threw it sparkling up towards the sky. Here and there a sail&ndash;boat silently glided into view, or sank below the faint blue line that marked the horizon&mdash;glided and melted away like the spectral shadows that sometimes haunt the white snow&ndash;fields in the cold, tranquil light of a winter&#39;s moon. As I stood by my window that morning, looking out upon the lake, my thoughts were etherealized&mdash;the reflected sunbeams suggested visions of crowns studded with the jewels of eternal life, and I wondered how any one could call Hyde Park a dreary place. I had seen so much trouble in my life, that I was willing to fold my arms and sink into a passive slumber&mdash;slumber anywhere, so the great longing of the soul was gratified&mdash;rest.</p>
<p>
	Robert spent the day in his room with his books, while I remained in Mrs. Lincoln&#39;s room, talking with her, contrasting the present with the past, and drawing plans for the future. She held no communication, by letter or otherwise, with any of her relatives or old friends, saying that she wished to lead a secluded life for the summer. Old faces, she claimed, would only bring back memories of scenes that she desired to forget; and new faces, she felt assured, could not sympathize with her distress, or add to the comforts of her situation.</p>
<p>
	On Monday morning, Robert was getting ready to ride into Chicago, as business called him to the city.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Where you goin&#39;, brother Bob?&quot;&mdash;Tad generally called Robert, brother Bob.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Only into town!&quot; was the brief reply.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Mayn&#39;t I go with you?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Ask mother. I think that she will say no.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Just then Mrs. Lincoln came in, and Tad ran to her, with the eager question:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Oh, Ma! can&#39;t I go to town with brother Bob? I want to go so badly.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Go to town! No; you must stay and keep me company. Besides, I have determined that you shall get a lesson every day, and I am going to commence to&ndash;day with you.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I don&#39;t want to get a lesson&mdash;I won&#39;t get a lesson,&quot; broke in the impetuous boy. &quot;I don&#39;t want to learn my book; I want to go to town!&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I suppose you want to grow up to be a great dunce. Hush, Tad; you shall not go to town until you have said a lesson;&quot; and the mother looked resolute.</p>
<p>
	&quot;May I go after I learn my book?&quot; was the next question.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Yes; if Robert will wait for you.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Oh, Bob will wait; won&#39;t you, Bob?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;No, I cannot wait; but the landlord is going in this afternoon, and you can go with him. You must do as mother tells you, Tad. You are getting to be a big boy now, and must start to school next fall; and you would not like to go to school without knowing how to read.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Where&#39;s my book, Ma? Get my book quick. I will say my lesson,&quot; and he jumped about the room, boisterously, boy&ndash;like.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Be quiet, Tad. Here is your book, and we will now begin the first lesson,&quot; said his mother, as she seated herself in an easy&ndash;chair.</p>
<p>
	Tad had always been much humored by his parents, especially by his father. He suffered from a slight impediment in his speech, and had never been made to go to school; consequently his book knowledge was very limited. I knew that his education had been neglected, but had no idea he was so deficient as the first lesson at Hyde Park proved him to be.</p>
<p>
	Drawing a low chair to his mother&#39;s side, he opened his book, and began to slowly spell the first word, &quot;A&ndash;P&ndash;E.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Well, what does A&ndash;p&ndash;e spell?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Monkey,&quot; was the instant rejoinder. The word was illustrated by a small wood&ndash;cut of an ape, which looked to Tad&#39;s eyes very much like a monkey; and his pronunciation was guided by the picture, and not by the sounds of the different letters.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Nonsense!&quot; exclaimed his mother. &quot;A&ndash;p&ndash;e does not spell monkey.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Does spell monkey! Isn&#39;t that a monkey?&quot; and Tad pointed triumphantly to the picture.</p>
<p>
	&quot;No, it is not a monkey.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Not a monkey! what is it, then?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;An ape.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;An ape! &#39;taint an ape. Don&#39;t I know a monkey when I see it?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;No, if you say that is a monkey.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I do know a monkey. I&#39;ve seen lots of them in the street with the organs. I know a monkey better than you do, &#39;cause I always go out into the street to see them when they come by, and you don&#39;t.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;But, Tad, listen to me. An ape is a species of the monkey. It looks like a monkey, but it is not a monkey.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;It shouldn&#39;t look like a monkey, then. Here, Yib&quot;&mdash;he always called me Yib&mdash;&quot;isn&#39;t this a monkey, and don&#39;t A&ndash;p&ndash;e spell monkey? Ma don&#39;t know anything about it;&quot; and he thrust his book into my face in an earnest, excited manner.</p>
<p>
	I could not longer restrain myself, and burst out laughing. Tad looked very much offended, and I hastened to say: &quot;I beg your pardon, Master Tad; I hope that you will excuse my want of politeness.&quot;</p>
<p>
	He bowed his head in a patronizing way, and returned to the original question: &quot;Isn&#39;t this a monkey? Don&#39;t A&ndash;p&ndash;e spell monkey?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;No, Tad; your mother is right. A&ndash;p&ndash;e spells ape.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;You don&#39;t know as much as Ma. Both of you don&#39;t know anything;&quot; and Master Tad&#39;s eyes flashed with indignation.</p>
<p>
	Robert entered the room, and the question was referred to him. After many explanations, he succeeded in convincing Tad that A&ndash;p&ndash;e does not spell monkey, and the balance of the lesson was got over with less difficulty.</p>
<p>
	Whenever I think of this incident I am tempted to laugh; and then it occurs to me that had Tad been a negro boy, not the son of a President, and so difficult to instruct, he would have been called thick&ndash;skulled, and would have been held up as an example of the inferiority of race. I know many full negro boys, able to read and write, who are not older than Tad Lincoln was when he persisted that A&ndash;p&ndash;e spelt monkey. Do not imagine that I desire to reflect upon the intellect of little Tad. Not at all; he is a bright boy, a son that will do honor to the genius and greatness of his father; I only mean to say that some incidents are about as damaging to one side of the question as to the other. If a colored boy appears dull, so does a white boy sometimes; and if a whole race is judged by a single example of apparent dulness, another race should be judged by a similar example.</p>
<p>
	I returned to Washington, with Mrs. Lincoln&#39;s best wishes for my success in business. The journey was devoid of incident. After resting a few days, I called at the White House, and transacted some business for Mrs. Lincoln. I had no desire to enter the house, for everything about it bitterly reminded me of the past; and when I came out of the door, I hoped that I had crossed the threshold for the last time. I was asked by some of my friends if I had sent my business cards to Mr. Johnson&#39;s family, and my answer was that I had not, as I had no desire to work for the President&#39;s family. Mr. Johnson was no friend to Mr. Lincoln, and he had failed to treat Mrs. Lincoln, in the hour of her greatest sorrow, with even common courtesy.</p>
<p>
	Having promised to make a spring trousseau for Mrs. Senator Douglas as soon as I should return from Chicago, I called on her to meet the engagement. She appeared pleased to see me, and in greeting me, asked, with evident surprise:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Why, Keckley&quot;&mdash;she always called me Keckley&mdash;&quot;is this you? I did not know you were coming back. It was reported that you designed remaining with Mrs. Lincoln all summer.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Mrs. Lincoln would have been glad to have kept me with her had she been able.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Able! What do you mean by that?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Simply this: Already she is laboring under pecuniary embarrassment, and was only able to pay my expenses, and allow me nothing for my time.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;You surprise me. I thought she was left in good circumstances.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;So many think, it appears. Mrs. Lincoln, I assure you, is now practising the closest economy. I must do something for myself, Mrs. Douglas, so I have come back to Washington to open my shop.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The next day I collected my assistants, and my business went on as usual. Orders came in more rapidly than I could fill them. One day, in the middle of the month of June, the girl who was attending the door came into the cutting&ndash;room, where I was hard at work:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Mrs. Keckley, there is a lady below, who wants to see you.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Who is she?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I don&#39;t know. I did not learn her name.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Is her face familiar? Does she look like a regular customer?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;No, she is a stranger. I don&#39;t think she was ever here before. She came in an open carriage, with a black woman for an attendant.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;It may be the wife of one of Johnson&#39;s new secretaries. Do go down, Mrs. Keckley,&quot; exclaimed my work&ndash;girls in a chorus. I went below, and on entering the parlor, a plainly dressed lady rose to her feet, and asked:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Is this the dressmaker?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Yes, I am a dressmaker.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Mrs. Keckley?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Mrs. Lincoln&#39;s former dressmaker, were you not?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Yes, I worked for Mrs. Lincoln.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Are you very busy now?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Very, indeed.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Can you do anything for me?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;That depends upon what is to be done, and when it is to be done.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Well, say one dress now, and several others a few weeks later.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I can make one dress for you now, but no more. I cannot finish the one for you in less than three weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;That will answer. I am Mrs. Patterson, the daughter of President Johnson. I expect my sister, Mrs. Stover, here in three weeks, and the dress is for her. We are both the same size, and you can fit the dress to me.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The terms were satisfactorily arranged, and after measuring Mrs. Patterson, she bade me good morning, entered her carriage, and drove away.</p>
<p>
	When I went up&ndash;stairs into the work&ndash;room, the girls were anxious to learn who my visitor was.</p>
<p>
	&quot;It was Mrs. Patterson, the daughter of President Johnson,&quot; I answered, in response to several questions.</p>
<p>
	&quot;What! the daughter of our good Moses. Are you going to work for her?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I have taken her order.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I fear that Johnson will prove a poor Moses, and I would not work for any of the family,&quot; remarked one of the girls. None of them appeared to like Mr. Lincoln&#39;s successor.</p>
<p>
	I finished the dress for Mrs. Patterson, and it gave satisfaction. I afterwards learned that both Mrs. Patterson and Mrs. Stover were kindhearted, plain, unassuming women, making no pretensions to elegance. One day when I called at the White House, in relation to some work that I was doing for them, I found Mrs. Patterson busily at work with a sewing&ndash;machine. The sight was a novel one to me for the White House, for as long as I remained with Mrs. Lincoln, I do not recollect ever having seen her with a needle in her hand. The last work done for the Johnsons by me were two dresses, one for each of the sisters. Mrs. Patterson subsequently wrote me a note, requesting me to cut and fit a dress for her; to which I replied that I never cut and fitted work to be made up outside of my work&ndash;room. This brought our business relations to an abrupt end.</p>
<p>
	The months passed, and my business prospered. I continually received letters from Mrs. Lincoln, and as the anniversary of her husband&#39;s death approached, she wrote in a sadder strain. Before I left Chicago she had exacted the promise that should Congress make an appropriation for her benefit, I must join her in the West, and go with her to visit the tomb of the President for the first time. The appropriation was made one of the conditions of my visit, for without relief from Congress she would be unable to bear my expenses. The appropriation was not made; and so I was unable to join Mrs. Lincoln at the appointed time. She wrote me that her plan was to leave Chicago in the morning with Tad, reach Springfield at night, stop at one of the hotels, drive out to Oak Ridge the next day, and take the train for Chicago the same evening, thus avoiding a meeting with any of her old friends. This plan, as she afterwards wrote me, was carried out. When the second anniversary approached, President Johnson and party were &quot;swinging round the circle,&quot; and as they were to visit Chicago, she was especially anxious to be away from the city when they should arrive; accordingly she hurried off to Springfield, and spent the time in weeping over the tomb where repose the hallowed ashes of her husband.</p>
<p>
	During all this time I was asked many questions about Mrs. Lincoln, some prompted by friendship, but a greater number by curiosity; but my brief answers, I fear, were not always accepted as the most satisfactory.</p>
