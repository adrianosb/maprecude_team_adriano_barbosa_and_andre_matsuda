	&ldquo;They shooked hands,&rdquo; said Bruno, who was trotting at my side, in answer to the unspoken question.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And they looked ever so pleased!&rdquo; Sylvie added from the other side.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, we must get on, now, as quick as we can,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If only I knew the best way to Hunter&rsquo;s farm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be sure to know in this cottage,&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes, I suppose they will. Bruno, would you run in and ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Sylvie stopped him, laughingly, as he ran off. &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I must make you visible first, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And audible too, I suppose?&rdquo; I said, as she took the jewel, that hung round her neck, and waved it over his head, and touched his eyes and lips with it.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sylvie: &ldquo;and once, do you know, I made him audible, and forgot to make him visible! And he went to buy some sweeties in a shop. And the man was so frightened! A voice seemed to come out of the air, &lsquo;Please, I want two ounces of barley-sugar drops!&rsquo; And a shilling came bang down upon the counter! And the man said &lsquo;I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t see you!&rsquo; And Bruno said &lsquo;It doosn&rsquo;t sinnify seeing me, so long as oo can see the shilling!&rsquo; But the man said he never sold barley-sugar drops to people he couldn&rsquo;t see. So we had to&mdash;Now, Bruno, you&rsquo;re ready!&rdquo; And away he trotted.</p>
<p>
	Sylvie spent the time, while we were waiting for him, in making herself visible also. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather awkward, you know,&rdquo; she explained to me, &ldquo;when we meet people, and they can see one of us, and ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t see the other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	In a minute or two Bruno returned, looking rather disconsolate. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d got friends with him, and he were cross!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He asked me who I were. And I said &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Bruno: who is these peoples?&rsquo; And he said &lsquo;One&rsquo;s my half-brother, and &ldquo;&lsquo;other&rsquo;s my half-sister: and I don&rsquo;t want no more company! Go along with yer!&rsquo; And I said &lsquo;I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go along wizout mine self!&rsquo; And I said &lsquo;Oo shouldn&rsquo;t have bits of peoples lying about like that! It&rsquo;s welly untidy!&rsquo; And he said &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t talk to me!&rsquo; And he pushted me outside! And he shutted the door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And you never asked where Hunter&rsquo;s farm was?&rdquo; queried Sylvie.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t room for any questions,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;The room were so crowded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Three people couldn&rsquo;t crowd a room,&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;They did, though,&rdquo; Bruno persisted. &ldquo;He crowded it most. He&rsquo;s such a welly thick man&mdash;so as oo couldn&rsquo;t knock him down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I failed to see the drift of Bruno&rsquo;s argument. &ldquo;Surely anybody could be knocked down,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;thick or thin wouldn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oo couldn&rsquo;t knock him down,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s more wide than he&rsquo;s high: so, when he&rsquo;s lying down he&rsquo;s more higher than when he&rsquo;s standing: so a-course oo couldn&rsquo;t knock him down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another cottage,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask the way, this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	There was no need to go in, this time, as the woman was standing in the doorway, with a baby in her arms talking to a respectably dressed man&mdash;a farmer, as I guessed&mdash;who seemed to be on his way to the town.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;&mdash;and when there&rsquo;s drink to be had,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s just the worst o&rsquo; the lot, is your Willie. So they tell me. He gets fairly mad wi&rsquo; it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have given &lsquo;em the lie to their faces, a twelve-month back!&rdquo; the woman said in a broken voice. &ldquo;But a&rsquo; canna noo! A&rsquo; canna noo!&rdquo; She checked herself on catching sight of us, and hastily retreated into the house shutting the door after her.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Perhaps you can tell me where Hunter&rsquo;s farm is?&rdquo; I said to the man, as he turned away from the house.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I can that, Sir!&rdquo; he replied with a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m John Hunter hissel, at your service. It&rsquo;s nobbut half a mile further&mdash;the only house in sight, when you get round bend o&rsquo; the road yonder. You&rsquo;ll find my good woman within, if so be you&rsquo;ve business wi&rsquo; her. Or mebbe I&rsquo;ll do as well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I want to order some milk. Perhaps I had better arrange it with your wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;She minds all that. Good day t&rsquo;ye, Master&mdash;and to your bonnie childer, as well!&rdquo; And he trudged on.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He should have said &lsquo;child&rsquo;, not &lsquo;childer&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;Sylvie&rsquo;s not a childer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He meant both of us,&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Bruno persisted. &ldquo; &lsquo;cause he said &lsquo;bonnie&rsquo;, oo know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, at any rate he looked at us both,&rdquo; Sylvie maintained.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, then he must have seen we&rsquo;re not both bonnie!&rdquo; Bruno retorted. &ldquo;A-course I&rsquo;m much uglier than oo! Didn&rsquo;t he mean Sylvie, Mister Sir?&rdquo; he shouted over his shoulder, as he ran off.</p>
<p>
	But there was no use in replying, as he had already vanished round the bend of the road. When we overtook him he was climbing a gate, and was gazing earnestly into the field, where a horse, a cow, and a kid were browsing amicably together. &ldquo;For its father, a Horse,&rdquo; he murmured to himself. &ldquo;For its mother, a Cow. For their dear little child, a little Goat, is the most curiousest thing I ever seen in my world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Bruno&rsquo;s World!&rdquo; I pondered. &ldquo;Yes, I suppose every child has a world of his own&mdash;and every man, too, for the matter of that. I wonder if that&rsquo;s the cause for all the misunderstanding there is in Life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;That must be Hunter&rsquo;s farm!&rdquo; said Sylvie, pointing to a house on the brow of the hill, led up to by a cart-road. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other farm in sight, this way; and you said we must be nearly there by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I had thought it, while Bruno was climbing the gate, but I couldn&rsquo;t remember having said it. However, Sylvie was evidently in the right. &ldquo;Get down, Bruno,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and open the gate for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing we&rsquo;s with oo, isn&rsquo;t it, Mister Sir?&rdquo; said Bruno, as we entered the field. &ldquo;That big dog might have bited oo, if oo&rsquo;d been alone! Oo needn&rsquo;t be frightened of it!&rdquo; he whispered, clinging tight to my hand to encourage me. &ldquo;It aren&rsquo;t fierce!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Fierce!&rdquo; Sylvie scornfully echoed, as the dog&mdash;a magnificent Newfoundland&mdash;that had come galloping down the field to meet us, began curveting round us, in gambols full of graceful beauty, and welcoming us with short joyful barks. &ldquo;Fierce! Why, it&rsquo;s as gentle as a lamb! It&rsquo;s&mdash; why, Bruno, don&rsquo;t you know? It&rsquo;s &rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So it are!&rdquo; cried Bruno, rushing forwards and throwing his arms round its neck. &ldquo;Oh, you dear dog!&rdquo; And it seemed as if the two children would never have done hugging and stroking it.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And how ever did he get here?&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;Ask him, Sylvie. I doosn&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	And then began an eager talk in Doggee, which of course was lost upon me; and I could only guess, when the beautiful creature, with a sly glance at me, whispered something in Sylvie&rsquo;s ear, that I was now the subject of conversation. Sylvie looked round laughingly.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He asked me who you are,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;And I said &rsquo;He&rsquo;s our friend&rsquo;. And he said &lsquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rsquo; And I said &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Mister Sir&rsquo;. And he said &lsquo;Bosh!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What is &lsquo;Bosh!&rsquo; in Doggee,&rdquo; I enquired.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same as in English,&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;Only, when a dog says it, it&rsquo;s a sort of whisper, that&rsquo;s half a cough and half a bark. Nero, say &rsquo;Bosh!&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>
<p>
	And Nero, who had now begun gamboling round us again, said &ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; several times; and I found that Sylvie&rsquo;s description of the sound was perfectly accurate.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s behind this long wall?&rdquo; I said, as we walked on.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Orchard,&rdquo; Sylvie replied, after a consultation with Nero. &ldquo;See, there&rsquo;s a boy getting down off the wall, at that far corner. And now he&rsquo;s running away across the field. I do believe he&rsquo;s been stealing the apples!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Bruno set off after him, but returned to us in a few moments, as he had evidently no chance of overtaking the young rascal.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t catch him!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wiss I&rsquo;d started a little sooner. His pockets was full of apples!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The Dog-King looked up at Sylvie, and said something in Doggee.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Why, of course you can!&rdquo; Sylvie exclaimed. &ldquo;How stupid not to think of it! Nero&rsquo;ll hold him for us, Bruno! But I&rsquo;d better make him invisible, first.&rdquo; And she hastily got out the Magic Jewel, and began waving it over Nero&rsquo;s head, and down along his back.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; cried Bruno, impatiently. &ldquo;After him, good Doggie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, Bruno!&rdquo; Sylvie exclaimed reproachfully. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have sent him off so quick! I hadn&rsquo;t done the tail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile Nero was coursing like a greyhound down the field: so at least I concluded from all I could see of him&mdash;the long feathery tail, which floated like a meteor through the air&mdash;and in a very few seconds he had come up with the little thief.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got him safe, by one foot!&rdquo; cried Sylvie, who was eagerly watching the chase. &ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s no hurry, Bruno!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	So we walked, quite leisurely, down the field, to where the frightened lad stood. A more curious sight I had seldom seen, in all my &ldquo;eerie&rdquo; experiences. Every bit of him was in violent action, except the left foot, which was apparently glued to the ground&mdash;there being nothing visibly holding it: while, at some little distance, the long feathery tail was waving gracefully from side to side, showing that Nero, at least, regarded the whole affair as nothing but a magnificent game of play.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; I said, as gravely as I could.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Got the crahmp in me ahnkle!&rdquo; the thief groaned in reply. &ldquo;An&rsquo; me fut&rsquo;s gone to sleep!&rdquo; And he began to blubber aloud.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Now, look here!&rdquo; Bruno said in a commanding tone, getting in front of him. &ldquo;Oo&rsquo;ve got to give up those apples!</p>
<p>
	The lad glanced at me, but didn&rsquo;t seem to reckon my interference as worth anything. Then he glanced at Sylvie: she clearly didn&rsquo;t count for very much, either. Then he took courage. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take a better man than any of yer to get &lsquo;em!&rdquo; he retorted defiantly.</p>
<p>
	Sylvie stooped and patted the invisible Nero. &ldquo;A little tighter!&rdquo; she whispered. And a sharp yell from the ragged boy showed how promptly the Dog-King had taken the hint.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Is your ankle worse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And it&rsquo;ll get worse, and worse, and worse,&rdquo; Bruno solemnly assured him, &ldquo;till oo gives up those apples!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Apparently the thief was convinced of this at last, and he sulkily began emptying his pockets of the apples. The children watched from a little distance, Bruno dancing with delight at every fresh yell extracted from Nero&rsquo;s terrified prisoner.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; the boy said at last.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t all!&rdquo; cried Bruno. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s three more in that pocket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Another hint from Sylvie to the Dog-King&mdash;another sharp yell from the thief, now convicted of lying also&mdash; and the remaining three apples were surrendered.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Let him go, please,&rdquo; Sylvie said in Doggee, and the lad limped away at a great pace, stooping now and then to rub the ailing ankle in fear, seemingly, that the &ldquo;crahmp&rdquo; might attack it again.</p>
<p>
	Bruno ran back, with his booty, to the orchard wall, and pitched the apples over it one by one. &ldquo;I&rsquo;s welly afraid some of them&rsquo;s gone under the wrong trees!&rdquo; he panted, on overtaking us again.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The wrong trees!&rdquo; laughed Sylvie. &ldquo;Trees ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t do wrong! There&rsquo;s no such things as wrong trees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s no such things as right trees, neither!&rdquo; cried Bruno. And Sylvie gave up the point.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Wait a minute, please!&rdquo; she said to me. &ldquo;I must make Nero visible, you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No, please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Bruno, who had by this time mounted on the Royal back, and was twisting the Royal hair into a bridle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be such fun to have him like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, it does look funny,&rdquo; Sylvie admitted, and led the way to the farm-house, where the farmer&rsquo;s wife stood, evidently much perplexed at the weird procession now approaching her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s summat gone wrong wi&rsquo; my spectacles, I doubt!&rdquo; she murmured, as she took them off, and began diligently rubbing them with a corner of her apron.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile Sylvie had hastily pulled Bruno down from his steed, and had just time to make His Majesty, wholly visible before the spectacles were resumed.</p>
<p>
	All was natural, now; but the good woman still looked a little uneasy about it. &ldquo;My eyesight&rsquo;s getting bad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I see you now, my darlings! You&rsquo;ll give me a kiss, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Bruno got behind me, in a moment: however Sylvie put up her face, to be kissed, as representative of both, and we all went in together.</p>
