                <p>
	As bald as bald,&rdquo; was the bewildering reply. &ldquo;Now, Bruno, I&rsquo;ll tell you a story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell oo a story,&rdquo; said Bruno, beginning in a hurry for fear of Sylvie getting the start of him: &ldquo;once there were a Mouse&mdash;a little tiny Mouse&mdash;such a little Mouse! Oo never saw such a tiny Mouse&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Did nothing ever happen to it, Bruno?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you anything more to tell us, besides its being tiny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Nothing never happened to it,&rdquo; Bruno solemnly replied.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Why did nothing never happen to it?&rdquo; said Sylvie, who was sitting, with her head on Bruno&rsquo;s shoulder, patiently waiting for a chance of beginning her story.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It were too tiny,&rdquo; Bruno explained.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no reason!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;However tiny it was, things might happen to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Bruno looked pityingly at me, as if he thought me very stupid. &ldquo;It were too tiny,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;If anything happened to it, it would die&mdash;it were so very tiny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Really that&rsquo;s enough about its being tiny!&rdquo; Sylvie put in. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you invented any more about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t invented no more yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, then, you shouldn&rsquo;t begin a story till you&rsquo;ve invented more! Now be quiet, there&rsquo;s a good boy, and listen to my story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	And Bruno, having quite exhausted all his inventive faculty, by beginning in too great a hurry, quietly resigned himself to listening. &ldquo;Tell about the other Bruno, please,&rdquo; he said coaxingly.</p>
<p>
	Sylvie put her arms round his neck, and began:&mdash;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The wind was whispering among the trees,&rdquo; (&rdquo;That wasn&rsquo;t good manners!&rdquo; Bruno interrupted. &ldquo;Never mind about manners,&rdquo; said Sylvie) &ldquo;and it was evening&mdash;a nice moony evening, and the Owls were hooting&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Pretend they weren&rsquo;t Owls!&rdquo; Bruno pleaded, stroking her cheek with his fat little hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like Owls. Owls have such great big eyes. Pretend they were Chickens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Are you afraid of their great big eyes, Bruno?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t &rsquo;fraid of nothing,&rdquo; Bruno answered in as careless a tone as he could manage: &ldquo;they&rsquo;re ugly with their great big eyes. I think if they cried, the tears would be as big&mdash;oh, as big as the moon!&rdquo; And he laughed merrily. &ldquo;Doos Owls cry ever, Mister Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Owls cry never,&rdquo; I said gravely, trying to copy Bruno&rsquo;s way of speaking: &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve got nothing to be sorry for, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, but they have!&rdquo; Bruno exclaimed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re ever so sorry, &lsquo;cause they killed the poor little Mouses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re not sorry when they&rsquo;re hungry, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oo don&rsquo;t know nothing about Owls!&rdquo; Bruno scornfully remarked. &ldquo;When they&rsquo;re hungry, they&rsquo;re very, very sorry they killed the little Mouses, &lsquo;cause if they hadn&rsquo;t killed them there&rsquo;d be sumfin for supper, oo know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Bruno was evidently getting into a dangerously inventive state of mind, so Sylvie broke in with &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m going on with the story. So the Owls&mdash;the Chickens, I mean&mdash;were looking to see if they could find a nice fat Mouse for their supper&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Pretend it was a nice &lsquo;abbit!&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t a nice habit, to kill Mouses,&rdquo; Sylvie argued. &ldquo;I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t pretend that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say &rsquo;habit&rsquo;, oo silly fellow!&rdquo; Bruno replied with a merry twinkle in his eye. &ldquo;&rsquo;abbits&mdash;that runs about in the fields!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Rabbit? Well it can be a Rabbit, if you like. But you mustn&rsquo;t alter my story so much, Bruno. A Chicken couldn&rsquo;t eat a Rabbit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But it might have wished to see if it could try to eat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, it wished to see if it could try&mdash;oh, really, Bruno, that&rsquo;s nonsense! I shall go back to the Owls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, then, pretend they hadn&rsquo;t great eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And they saw a little Boy,&rdquo; Sylvie went on, disdaining to make any further corrections. &ldquo;And he asked them to tell him a story. And the Owls hooted and flew away&mdash;&rdquo; (&rdquo;Oo shouldn&rsquo;t say &rsquo;flewed&rsquo;; oo should say &rsquo;flied&rsquo;,&rdquo; Bruno whispered. But Sylvie wouldn&rsquo;t hear.) &ldquo;And he met a Lion. And he asked the Lion to tell him a story. And the Lion said &lsquo;yes&rsquo;, it would. And, while the Lion was telling him the story, it nibbled some of his head off&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;nibbled&rsquo;!&rdquo; Bruno entreated. &ldquo;Only little things nibble&mdash;little thin sharp things, with edges&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, then, it &rsquo;nubbled&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;And when it had nubbled all his head off, he went away, and he never said &lsquo;thank you&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;That were very rude,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;If he couldn&rsquo;t speak, he might have nodded&mdash;no, he couldn&rsquo;t nod. Well, he might have shaked hands with the Lion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d forgotten that part!&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;He did shake hands with it. He came back again, you know, and he thanked the Lion very much, for telling him the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Then his head had growed up again?&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh yes, it grew up in a minute. And the Lion begged pardon, and said it wouldn&rsquo;t nubble off little boys&rsquo; heads &mdash;not never no more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Bruno looked much pleased at this change of events. &ldquo;Now that are a really nice story!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t it a nice story, Mister Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I would like to hear another story about that Boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So would I,&rdquo; said Bruno, stroking Sylvie&rsquo;s cheek again. &ldquo;Please tell about Bruno&rsquo;s Picnic; and don&rsquo;t talk about nubbly Lions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t, if it frightens you,&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Flightens me!&rdquo; Bruno exclaimed indignantly. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that! It&rsquo;s &lsquo;cause &lsquo;nubbly&rsquo; &lsquo;s such a grumbly word to say&mdash; when one person&rsquo;s got her head on another person&rsquo;s shoulder. When she talks like that,&rdquo; he exclaimed to me, &ldquo;the talking goes down bofe sides of my face&mdash;all the way to my chin&mdash;and it doos tickle so! It&rsquo;s enough to make a beard grow, that it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He said this with great severity, but it was evidently meant for a joke: so Sylvie laughed&mdash;a delicious musical little laugh, and laid her soft cheek on the top of her brother&rsquo;s curly head, as if it were a pillow, while she went on with the story. &ldquo;So this Boy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t me, oo know!&rdquo; Bruno interrupted. &ldquo;And oo needn&rsquo;t try to look as if it was, Mister Sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I represented, respectfully, that I was trying to look as if it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;&mdash;he was a middling good Boy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He were a welly good Boy!&rdquo; Bruno corrected her. &ldquo;And he never did nothing he wasn&rsquo;t told to do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make a good Boy!&rdquo; Sylvie said contemptuously.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo; That do make a good Boy!&rdquo; Bruno insisted.</p>
<p>
	Sylvie gave up the point. &ldquo;Well, he was a very good boy and he always kept his promises, and he had a big cupboard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;&mdash;for to keep all his promises in!&rdquo; cried Bruno.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;If he kept all his promises,&rdquo; Sylvie said, with a mischievous look in her eyes, &ldquo;he wasn&rsquo;t like some Boys I know of!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He had to put salt with them, a-course,&rdquo; Bruno said gravely: &ldquo;oo ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t keep promises when there isn&rsquo;t any salt. And he kept his birthday on the second shelf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;How long did he keep his birthday?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I never can keep mine more than twenty-four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Why, a birthday stays that long by itself!&rdquo; cried Bruno . &ldquo;Oo doosn&rsquo;t know how to keep birthdays! This Boy kept his a whole year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And then the next birthday would begin,&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;So it would be his birthday always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So it were,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;Doos oo have treats on oor birthday, Mister Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;When oo&rsquo;re good, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Why, it is a sort of treat, being good, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A sort of treat!&rdquo; Bruno repeated. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sort of punishment I think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, Bruno!&rdquo; Sylvie interrupted, almost sadly. &ldquo;How can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, but it is,&rdquo; Bruno persisted. &ldquo;Why, look here, Mister Sir! This is being good!&rdquo; And he sat bolt upright, and put on an absurdly solemn face. &ldquo;First oo must sit up as straight as pokers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;&mdash;as straight as a poker,&rdquo; Sylvie corrected him.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;&mdash;as straight as pokers,&rdquo; Bruno firmly repeated. &ldquo;Then oo must clasp oor hands&mdash;so. Then&mdash; &lsquo;Why hasn&rsquo;t oo brushed oor hair? Go and brush it toreckly!&rsquo; Then&mdash;&rsquo;Oh, Bruno, oo mustn&rsquo;t dog&rsquo;s-ear the daisies!&rsquo; Did oo learn oor spelling wiz daisies, Mister Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I want to hear about that Boy&rsquo;s Birthday,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>
	Bruno returned to the story instantly. &ldquo;Well, so this Boy said &lsquo;Now it&rsquo;s my Birthday!&rsquo; And so&mdash;I&rsquo;m tired!&rdquo; he suddenly broke off, laying his head in Sylvie&rsquo;s lap. &ldquo;Sylvie knows it best. Sylvie&rsquo;s grown-upper than me. Go on, Sylvie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Sylvie patiently took up the thread of the story again. &ldquo;So he said &lsquo;Now it&rsquo;s my Birthday. Whatever shall I do to keep my Birthday?&rsquo; All good little Boys&mdash;&rdquo; (Sylvie turned away from Bruno, and made a great presence of whispering to me) &ldquo;&mdash;all good little Boys&mdash;Boys that learn their lessons quite perfect&mdash;they always keep their birthdays, you know. So of course this little Boy kept his Birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oo may call him Bruno, if oo like,&rdquo; the little fellow carelessly remarked. &ldquo;It weren&rsquo;t me, but it makes it more interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So Bruno said to himself &lsquo;The properest thing to do is to have a Picnic, all by myself, on the top of the hill. And I&rsquo;ll take some Milk, and some Bread, and some Apples: and first and foremost, I want some Milk!&rsquo; So, first and foremost, Bruno took a milk-pail&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And he went and milkted the Cow!&rdquo; Bruno put in.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sylvie, meekly accepting the new verb. &ldquo;And the Cow said &lsquo;Moo! What are you going to do with all that Milk?&rsquo; And Bruno said &lsquo;Please&rsquo;m, I want it for my Picnic.&rsquo; And the Cow said &lsquo;Moo! But I hope you wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t boil any of it?&rsquo; And Bruno said &lsquo;No, indeed I wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t! New Milk&rsquo;s so nice and so warm, it wants no boiling!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t want no boiling,&rsquo; Bruno offered as an amended version.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So Bruno put the Milk in a bottle. And then Bruno said &lsquo;Now I want some Bread!&rsquo; So he went to the Oven, and he took out a delicious new Loaf. And the Oven&mdash;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;&mdash;ever so light and so puffy!&rdquo; Bruno impatiently corrected her. &ldquo;Oo shouldn&rsquo;t leave out so many words!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Sylvie humbly apologized. &ldquo;&mdash;a delicious new Loaf, ever so light and so puffy. And the Oven said&mdash;&rdquo; Here Sylvie made a long pause. &ldquo;Really I don&rsquo;t know what an Oven begins with, when it wants to speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Both children looked appealingly at me; but I could only say, helplessly, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea! I never heard an Oven speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	For a minute or two we all sat silent; and then Bruno said, very softly, &ldquo;Oven begins wiz &lsquo;O&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Good little boy!&rdquo; Sylvie exclaimed. &ldquo;He does his spelling very nicely. He&rsquo;s cleverer than he knows!&rdquo; she added, aside, to me. &ldquo;So the Oven said &lsquo;O! What are you going to do with all that Bread?&rsquo; And Bruno said &lsquo;Please&mdash;&rsquo; Is an Oven &lsquo;Sir&rsquo; or &lsquo;m&rsquo;, would you say?&rdquo; She looked to me for a reply.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Both, I think,&rdquo; seemed to me the safest thing to say.</p>
<p>
	Sylvie adopted the suggestion instantly. &ldquo;So Bruno said &lsquo;Please, Sirm, I want it for my Picnic.&rsquo; And the Oven said &lsquo;O! But I hope you wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t toast any of it?&rsquo; And Bruno said, &lsquo;No, indeed I wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t! New Bread&rsquo;s so light and so puffy, it wants no toasting!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It never doesn&rsquo;t want no toasting,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;I wiss oo wouldn&rsquo;t say it so short!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So Bruno put the Bread in the hamper. Then Bruno said &lsquo;Now I want some Apples!&rsquo; So he took the hamper, and he went to the Apple-Tree, and he picked some lovely ripe Apples. And the Apple-Tree said&mdash;&rdquo; Here followed another long pause.</p>
<p>
	Bruno adopted his favourite expedient of tapping his forehead; while Sylvie gazed earnestly upwards, as if she hoped for some suggestion from the birds, who were singing merrily among the branches overhead. But no result followed.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What does an Apple-Tree begin with, when it wants to speak?&rdquo; Sylvie murmured despairingly, to the irresponsive birds.</p>
<p>
	At last, taking a leaf out of Bruno&rsquo;s book, I ventured on a remark. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t &lsquo;Apple-Tree&rsquo; always begin with &lsquo;Eh!&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Why, of course it does! How clever of you!&rdquo; Sylvie cried delightedly.</p>
<p>
	Bruno jumped up, and patted me on the head. I tried not to feel conceited.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So the Apple-Tree said &lsquo;Eh! What are you going to do with all those Apples?&rsquo; And Bruno said &lsquo;Please, Sir, I want them for my Picnic.&rsquo; And the Apple-Tree said &lsquo;Eh! But I hope you wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t bake any of them?&rsquo; And Bruno said &lsquo;No, indeed I wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t! Ripe Apples are so nice and so sweet, they want no baking!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;They never doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; Bruno was beginning, but Sylvie corrected herself before he could get the words out.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;&lsquo;They never doesn&rsquo;t nohow want no baking.&rsquo; So Bruno put the Apples in the hamper, along with the Bread, and the bottle of Milk. And he set off to have a Picnic, on the top of the hill, all by himself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t greedy, oo know, to have it all by himself,&rdquo; Bruno said, patting me on the cheek to call my attention; &ldquo; &lsquo;cause he hadn&rsquo;t got no brothers and sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It was very sad to have no sisters, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Bruno said thoughtfully, &ldquo; &lsquo;cause he hadn&rsquo;t no lessons to do. So he didn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Sylvie went on. &ldquo;So, as he was walking along the road he heard behind him such a curious sort of noise&mdash;a sort of a Thump! Thump! Thump! &lsquo;Whatever is that?&rsquo; said Bruno. &lsquo;Oh, I know!&rsquo; said Bruno. &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s only my Watch a-ticking!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Were it his Watch a-ticking?&rdquo; Bruno asked me, with eyes that fairly sparkled with mischievous delight.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No doubt of it!&rdquo; I replied. And Bruno laughed exultingly.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Then Bruno thought a little harder. And he said &lsquo;No! it ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be my Watch a-ticking; because I haven&rsquo;t got a Watch!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Bruno peered up anxiously into my face, to see how I took it. I hung my head, and put a thumb into my mouth, to the evident delight of the little fellow.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So Bruno went a little further along the road. And then he heard it again, that queer noise&mdash;Thump! Thump! Thump! &lsquo;Whatever is that?&rsquo; said Bruno. &lsquo;Oh, I know!&rsquo; said Bruno. &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s only the Carpenter amending my Wheelbarrow!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Were it the Carpenter a-mending his Wheelbarrow?&rdquo; Bruno asked me.</p>
<p>
	I brightened up, and said &ldquo;It must have been!&rdquo; in a tone of absolute conviction.</p>
<p>
	Bruno threw his arms round Sylvie&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;Sylvie!&rdquo; he said, in a perfectly audible whisper. &ldquo;He says it must have been!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Then Bruno thought a little harder. And he said &lsquo;No! It ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be the Carpenter a-mending my Wheelbarrow, because I haven&rsquo;t got a Wheelbarrow!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>
	This time I hid my face in my hands, quite unable to meet Bruno&rsquo;s look of triumph.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So Bruno went a little further along the road. And then he heard that queer noise again&mdash;Thump! Thump! Thump! So he thought he&rsquo;d look round, this time, just to see what it was. And what should it be but a great Lion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A great big Lion,&rdquo; Bruno corrected her.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A great big Lion. And Bruno was ever so frightened, and he ran&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No, he wasn&rsquo;t flightened a bit!&rdquo; Bruno interrupted. (He was evidently anxious for the reputation of his namesake.) &ldquo;He runned away to get a good look at the Lion; &lsquo;cause he wanted to see if it were the same Lion what used to nubble little Boys&rsquo; heads off; and he wanted to know how big it was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, he ran away, to get a good look at the Lion. And the Lion trotted slowly after him. And the Lion called after him, in a very gentle voice, &lsquo;Little Boy, little Boy, You needn&rsquo;t be afraid of me! I&rsquo;m a very gentle old Lion now. I never nubble little Boys&rsquo; heads off, as I used to do.&rsquo; And so Bruno said &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you really, Sir? Then what do you live on?&rsquo; And the Lion&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oo see he weren&rsquo;t a bit flightened!&rdquo; Bruno said to me, patting my cheek again. &ldquo; &lsquo;cause he remembered to call it Sir&rsquo;, oo know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I said that no doubt that was the real test whether a person was frightened or not.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And the Lion said &lsquo;Oh, I live on bread-and-butter, and cherries, and marmalade, and plum-cake&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;&mdash;and apples!&rdquo; Bruno put in.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes, &lsquo;and apples&rsquo;. And Bruno said &ldquo;wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you with me to my Picnic?&rsquo; And the Lion said &lsquo;Oh, I should like it very much indeed!&rsquo; And Bruno and the Lion went away together.&rdquo; Sylvie stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; I asked, despondingly.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Not quite all,&rdquo; Sylvie slily replied &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sentence or two more. Isn&rsquo;t there, Bruno?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; with a carelessness that was evidently put on &ldquo;just a sentence or two more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And, as they were walking along, they looked over a hedge, and who should they see but a little black Lamb! And the Lamb was ever so frightened. And it ran&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It were really flightened!&rdquo; Bruno put in.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It ran away. And Bruno ran after it. And he called &lsquo;Little Lamb! You needn&rsquo;t be afraid of this Lion! It never kills things! It lives on cherries, and marmalade&mdash;&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;&mdash;and apples!&rdquo; said Bruno. &lsquo;Oo always forgets the apples!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And Bruno said &lsquo;Wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you come with us to my Picnic?&rsquo; And the Lamb said &lsquo;Oh, I should like it very much indeed, if my Ma will let me!&rsquo; And Bruno said &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go and ask your Ma!&rsquo; And they went to the old Sheep. And Bruno said &lsquo;Please, may your little Lamb come to my Picnic?&rsquo; And the Sheep said &lsquo;Yes, if it&rsquo;s learnt all its lessons.&rsquo; And the Lamb said &lsquo;Oh yes, Ma! I&rsquo;ve learnt all my lessons!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Pretend it hadn&rsquo;t any lessons!&rdquo; Bruno earnestly pleaded.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, that would never do!&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t leave out all about the lessons! And the old Sheep said &lsquo;Do you know your A B C yet? Have you learnt A?&rsquo; And the Lamb said &lsquo;Oh yes, Ma! I went to the A-field, and I helped them to make A!&rsquo; &lsquo;Very good, my child! And have you learnt B?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh yes, Ma! I went to the B-hive, and the B gave me some honey!&rsquo; &lsquo;Very good, my child! And have you learnt C?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh yes, Ma! I went to the C-side, and I saw the ships sailing on the C!&rsquo; &lsquo;Very good, my child! You may go to Bruno&rsquo;s Picnic.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So they set off. And Bruno walked in the middle so that the Lamb mightn&rsquo;t see the Lion&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It were flightened,&rdquo; Bruno explained.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes, and it trembled so; and it got paler and paler; and, before they&rsquo;d got to the top of the hill, it was a white little Lamb&mdash;as white as snow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But Bruno weren&rsquo;t flightened!&rdquo; said the owner of that name. &ldquo;So he staid black!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t stay black! He staid pink!&rdquo; laughed Sylvie. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t kiss you like this, you know, if you were black!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oo&rsquo;d have to!&rdquo; Bruno said with great decision. &ldquo;Besides, Bruno wasn&rsquo;t Bruno, oo know&mdash;I mean, Bruno wasn&rsquo;t me&mdash;I mean&mdash;don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, Sylvie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t do it again!&rdquo; Sylvie said very humbly. &ldquo;And so, as they went along, the Lion said &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I used to do when I was a young Lion. I used to hide behind trees, to watch for little boys.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Bruno cuddled a little closer to her.) &ldquo;&lsquo;And, if a little thin scraggy Boy came by, why, I used to let him go. But, if a little fat juicy&mdash;&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Bruno could bear no more. &ldquo;Pretend he wasn&rsquo;t juicy!&rdquo; he pleaded, half-sobbing.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Nonsense, Bruno!&rdquo; Sylvie briskly replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be done in a moment! &lsquo;&mdash;if a little fat juicy Boy came by, why, I used to spring out and gobble him up! Oh, you&rsquo;ve no idea what a delicious thing it is&mdash;a little juicy Boy!&rsquo; And Bruno said &lsquo;Oh, if you please, Sir, don&rsquo;t talk about eating little boys! It makes me so shivery!</p>
<p>
	The real Bruno shivered, in sympathy with the hero.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And the Lion said &lsquo;Oh, well, we wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t talk about it, then! I&rsquo;ll tell you what happened on my wedding day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I like this part better,&rdquo; said Bruno, patting my cheek to keep me awake.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo; &lsquo;There was, oh, such a lovely wedding-breakfast! At one end of the table there was a large plum-pudding. And at the other end there was a nice roasted Lamb! Oh, you&rsquo;ve no idea what a delicious thing it is&mdash;a nice roasted Lamb!&rsquo; And the Lamb said &lsquo;Oh, if you please, Sir, don&rsquo;t talk about eating Lambs! It makes me so shivery!&rsquo; And the Lion said &lsquo;Oh, well, we wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t talk about it, then!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
