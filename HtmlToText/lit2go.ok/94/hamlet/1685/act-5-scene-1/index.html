	ACT V</p>
<p>
	SCENE I. A churchyard.</p>
<p>
	(Enter two Clowns, with spades, &amp; c)</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	Is she to be buried in Christian burial that<br />
	wilfully seeks her own salvation?</p>
<p>
	Second Clown<br />
	I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave<br />
	straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it<br />
	Christian burial.</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her<br />
	own defence?</p>
<p>
	Second Clown<br />
	Why, &#39;tis found so.</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	It must be &#39;se offendendo;&#39; it cannot be else. For<br />
	here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,<br />
	it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it<br />
	is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned<br />
	herself wittingly.</p>
<p>
	Second Clown<br />
	Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here<br />
	stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,<br />
	and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he<br />
	goes,&mdash;mark you that; but if the water come to him<br />
	and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he<br />
	that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.</p>
<p>
	Second Clown<br />
	But is this law?</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	Ay, marry, is&#39;t; crowner&#39;s quest law.</p>
<p>
	Second Clown<br />
	Will you ha&#39; the truth on&#39;t? If this had not been<br />
	a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o&#39;<br />
	Christian burial.</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	Why, there thou say&#39;st: and the more pity that<br />
	great folk should have countenance in this world to<br />
	drown or hang themselves, more than their even<br />
	Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient<br />
	gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:<br />
	they hold up Adam&#39;s profession.</p>
<p>
	Second Clown<br />
	Was he a gentleman?</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	He was the first that ever bore arms.</p>
<p>
	Second Clown<br />
	Why, he had none.</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the<br />
	Scripture? The Scripture says &#39;Adam digged:&#39;<br />
	could he dig without arms? I&#39;ll put another<br />
	question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the<br />
	purpose, confess thyself&mdash;</p>
<p>
	Second Clown<br />
	Go to.</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	What is he that builds stronger than either the<br />
	mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?</p>
<p>
	Second Clown<br />
	The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a<br />
	thousand tenants.</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows<br />
	does well; but how does it well? it does well to<br />
	those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the<br />
	gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,<br />
	the gallows may do well to thee. To&#39;t again, come.</p>
<p>
	Second Clown<br />
	&#39;Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or<br />
	a carpenter?&#39;</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.</p>
<p>
	Second Clown<br />
	Marry, now I can tell.</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	To&#39;t.</p>
<p>
	Second Clown<br />
	Mass, I cannot tell.</p>
<p>
	(Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance)</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull<br />
	ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when<br />
	you are asked this question next, say &#39;a<br />
	grave-maker: &#39;the houses that he makes last till<br />
	doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a<br />
	stoup of liquor.</p>
<p>
	(Exit Second Clown)</p>
<p>
	[He digs and sings]</p>
<p>
	In youth, when I did love, did love,<br />
	Methought it was very sweet,<br />
	To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,<br />
	O, methought, there was nothing meet.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he<br />
	sings at grave-making?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	&#39;Tis e&#39;en so: the hand of little employment hath<br />
	the daintier sense.</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	[Sings]<br />
	But age, with his stealing steps,<br />
	Hath claw&#39;d me in his clutch,<br />
	And hath shipped me intil the land,<br />
	As if I had never been such.</p>
<p>
	[Throws up a skull]</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:<br />
	how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were<br />
	Cain&#39;s jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It<br />
	might be the pate of a politician, which this ass<br />
	now o&#39;er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,<br />
	might it not?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	It might, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Or of a courtier; which could say &#39;Good morrow,<br />
	sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?&#39; This might<br />
	be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord<br />
	such-a-one&#39;s horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Ay, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Why, e&#39;en so: and now my Lady Worm&#39;s; chapless, and<br />
	knocked about the mazzard with a sexton&#39;s spade:<br />
	here&#39;s fine revolution, an we had the trick to<br />
	see&#39;t. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,<br />
	but to play at loggats with &#39;em? mine ache to think on&#39;t.</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	[Sings]<br />
	A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,<br />
	For and a shrouding sheet:<br />
	O, a pit of clay for to be made<br />
	For such a guest is meet.<br />
	Throws up another skull</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	There&#39;s another: why may not that be the skull of a<br />
	lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,<br />
	his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he<br />
	suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the<br />
	sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of<br />
	his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be<br />
	in&#39;s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,<br />
	his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,<br />
	his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and<br />
	the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine<br />
	pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him<br />
	no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than<br />
	the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The<br />
	very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in<br />
	this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Not a jot more, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Is not parchment made of sheepskins?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance<br />
	in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose<br />
	grave&#39;s this, sirrah?</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	Mine, sir.<br />
	Sings</p>
<p>
	O, a pit of clay for to be made<br />
	For such a guest is meet.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in&#39;t.</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	You lie out on&#39;t, sir, and therefore it is not<br />
	yours: for my part, I do not lie in&#39;t, and yet it is mine.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	&#39;Thou dost lie in&#39;t, to be in&#39;t and say it is thine:<br />
	&#39;tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	&#39;Tis a quick lie, sir; &#39;twill away gain, from me to<br />
	you.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	What man dost thou dig it for?</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	For no man, sir.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	What woman, then?</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	For none, neither.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Who is to be buried in&#39;t?</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she&#39;s dead.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the<br />
	card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,<br />
	Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of<br />
	it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the<br />
	peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he<br />
	gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a<br />
	grave-maker?</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	Of all the days i&#39; the year, I came to&#39;t that day<br />
	that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	How long is that since?</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it<br />
	was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that<br />
	is mad, and sent into England.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits<br />
	there; or, if he do not, it&#39;s no great matter there.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Why?<br />
	First Clown<br />
	&#39;Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men<br />
	are as mad as he.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	How came he mad?</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	Very strangely, they say.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	How strangely?</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	Faith, e&#39;en with losing his wits.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Upon what ground?</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man<br />
	and boy, thirty years.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	How long will a man lie i&#39; the earth ere he rot?</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	I&#39; faith, if he be not rotten before he die&mdash;as we<br />
	have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce<br />
	hold the laying in&mdash;he will last you some eight year<br />
	or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Why he more than another?</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that<br />
	he will keep out water a great while; and your water<br />
	is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.<br />
	Here&#39;s a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth<br />
	three and twenty years.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Whose was it?</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	A whoreson mad fellow&#39;s it was: whose do you think it was?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Nay, I know not.</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a&#39; poured a<br />
	flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,<br />
	sir, was Yorick&#39;s skull, the king&#39;s jester.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	This?</p>
<p>
	First Clown<br />
	E&#39;en that.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Let me see.</p>
<p>
	[Takes the skull]</p>
<p>
	Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow<br />
	of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath<br />
	borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how<br />
	abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at<br />
	it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know<br />
	not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your<br />
	gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,<br />
	that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one<br />
	now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?<br />
	Now get you to my lady&#39;s chamber, and tell her, let<br />
	her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must<br />
	come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell<br />
	me one thing.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	What&#39;s that, my lord?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Dost thou think Alexander looked o&#39; this fashion i&#39;<br />
	the earth?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	E&#39;en so.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	And smelt so? pah!</p>
<p>
	[Puts down the skull]</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	E&#39;en so, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may<br />
	not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,<br />
	till he find it stopping a bung-hole?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	&#39;Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with<br />
	modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as<br />
	thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,<br />
	Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of<br />
	earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he<br />
	was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?<br />
	Imperious Caesar, dead and turn&#39;d to clay,<br />
	Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:<br />
	O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,<br />
	Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!<br />
	But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.</p>
<p>
	(Enter Priest, &amp; c. in procession; the Corpse of OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains, &amp; c)</p>
<p>
	The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?<br />
	And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken<br />
	The corse they follow did with desperate hand<br />
	Fordo its own life: &#39;twas of some estate.<br />
	Couch we awhile, and mark.</p>
<p>
	(Retiring with HORATIO)</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	What ceremony else?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	That is Laertes,<br />
	A very noble youth: mark.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	What ceremony else?</p>
<p>
	First Priest<br />
	Her obsequies have been as far enlarged<br />
	As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;<br />
	And, but that great command o&#39;ersways the order,<br />
	She should in ground unsanctified have lodged<br />
	Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,<br />
	Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;<br />
	Yet here she is allow&#39;d her virgin crants,<br />
	Her maiden strewments and the bringing home<br />
	Of bell and burial.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Must there no more be done?</p>
<p>
	First Priest<br />
	No more be done:<br />
	We should profane the service of the dead<br />
	To sing a requiem and such rest to her<br />
	As to peace-parted souls.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Lay her i&#39; the earth:<br />
	And from her fair and unpolluted flesh<br />
	May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,<br />
	A ministering angel shall my sister be,<br />
	When thou liest howling.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	What, the fair Ophelia!</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Sweets to the sweet: farewell!</p>
<p>
	[Scattering flowers]</p>
<p>
	I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet&#39;s wife;<br />
	I thought thy bride-bed to have deck&#39;d, sweet maid,<br />
	And not have strew&#39;d thy grave.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	O, treble woe<br />
	Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,<br />
	Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense<br />
	Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,<br />
	Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:</p>
<p>
	[Leaps into the grave]</p>
<p>
	Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,<br />
	Till of this flat a mountain you have made,<br />
	To o&#39;ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head<br />
	Of blue Olympus.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	[Advancing] What is he whose grief<br />
	Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow<br />
	Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand<br />
	Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,<br />
	Hamlet the Dane.</p>
<p>
	[Leaps into the grave]</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	The devil take thy soul!</p>
<p>
	[Grappling with him]</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Thou pray&#39;st not well.<br />
	I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;<br />
	For, though I am not splenitive and rash,<br />
	Yet have I something in me dangerous,<br />
	Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Pluck them asunder.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Hamlet, Hamlet!</p>
<p>
	All<br />
	Gentlemen,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Good my lord, be quiet.</p>
<p>
	(The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave)</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Why I will fight with him upon this theme<br />
	Until my eyelids will no longer wag.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	O my son, what theme?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers<br />
	Could not, with all their quantity of love,<br />
	Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	O, he is mad, Laertes.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	For love of God, forbear him.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	&#39;Swounds, show me what thou&#39;lt do:<br />
	Woo&#39;t weep? woo&#39;t fight? woo&#39;t fast? woo&#39;t tear thyself?<br />
	Woo&#39;t drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?<br />
	I&#39;ll do&#39;t. Dost thou come here to whine?<br />
	To outface me with leaping in her grave?<br />
	Be buried quick with her, and so will I:<br />
	And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw<br />
	Millions of acres on us, till our ground,<br />
	Singeing his pate against the burning zone,<br />
	Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou&#39;lt mouth,<br />
	I&#39;ll rant as well as thou.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	This is mere madness:<br />
	And thus awhile the fit will work on him;<br />
	Anon, as patient as the female dove,<br />
	When that her golden couplets are disclosed,<br />
	His silence will sit drooping.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Hear you, sir;<br />
	What is the reason that you use me thus?<br />
	I loved you ever: but it is no matter;<br />
	Let Hercules himself do what he may,<br />
	The cat will mew and dog will have his day.</p>
<p>
	(Exit)</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.</p>
<p>
	(Exit HORATIO)</p>
<p>
	[To LAERTES]</p>
<p>
	Strengthen your patience in our last night&#39;s speech;<br />
	We&#39;ll put the matter to the present push.<br />
	Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.<br />
	This grave shall have a living monument:<br />
	An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;<br />
	Till then, in patience our proceeding be.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt)</p>
