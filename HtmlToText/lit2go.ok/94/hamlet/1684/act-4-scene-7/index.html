	SCENE VII. Another room in the castle.</p>
<p>
	(Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES)</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,<br />
	And you must put me in your heart for friend,<br />
	Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,<br />
	That he which hath your noble father slain<br />
	Pursued my life.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	It well appears: but tell me<br />
	Why you proceeded not against these feats,<br />
	So crimeful and so capital in nature,<br />
	As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,<br />
	You mainly were stirr&#39;d up.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	O, for two special reasons;<br />
	Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew&#39;d,<br />
	But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother<br />
	Lives almost by his looks; and for myself&mdash;<br />
	My virtue or my plague, be it either which&mdash;<br />
	She&#39;s so conjunctive to my life and soul,<br />
	That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,<br />
	I could not but by her. The other motive,<br />
	Why to a public count I might not go,<br />
	Is the great love the general gender bear him;<br />
	Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,<br />
	Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,<br />
	Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,<br />
	Too slightly timber&#39;d for so loud a wind,<br />
	Would have reverted to my bow again,<br />
	And not where I had aim&#39;d them.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	And so have I a noble father lost;<br />
	A sister driven into desperate terms,<br />
	Whose worth, if praises may go back again,<br />
	Stood challenger on mount of all the age<br />
	For her perfections: but my revenge will come.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think<br />
	That we are made of stuff so flat and dull<br />
	That we can let our beard be shook with danger<br />
	And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:<br />
	I loved your father, and we love ourself;<br />
	And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine&mdash;</p>
<p>
	(Enter a Messenger)</p>
<p>
	How now! what news?</p>
<p>
	Messenger<br />
	Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:<br />
	This to your majesty; this to the queen.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	From Hamlet! who brought them?</p>
<p>
	Messenger<br />
	Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:<br />
	They were given me by Claudio; he received them<br />
	Of him that brought them.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.</p>
<p>
	Exit Messenger</p>
<p>
	[Reads]</p>
<p>
	&#39;High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on<br />
	your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see<br />
	your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your<br />
	pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden<br />
	and more strange return. &#39;HAMLET.&#39;<br />
	What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?<br />
	Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Know you the hand?</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	&#39;Tis Hamlets character. &#39;Naked!<br />
	And in a postscript here, he says &#39;alone.&#39;<br />
	Can you advise me?</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	I&#39;m lost in it, my lord. But let him come;<br />
	It warms the very sickness in my heart,<br />
	That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,<br />
	&#39;Thus didest thou.&#39;</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	If it be so, Laertes&mdash;<br />
	As how should it be so? how otherwise?&mdash;<br />
	Will you be ruled by me?</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Ay, my lord;<br />
	So you will not o&#39;errule me to a peace.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	To thine own peace. If he be now return&#39;d,<br />
	As checking at his voyage, and that he means<br />
	No more to undertake it, I will work him<br />
	To an exploit, now ripe in my device,<br />
	Under the which he shall not choose but fall:<br />
	And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,<br />
	But even his mother shall uncharge the practise<br />
	And call it accident.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	My lord, I will be ruled;<br />
	The rather, if you could devise it so<br />
	That I might be the organ.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	It falls right.<br />
	You have been talk&#39;d of since your travel much,<br />
	And that in Hamlet&#39;s hearing, for a quality<br />
	Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts<br />
	Did not together pluck such envy from him<br />
	As did that one, and that, in my regard,<br />
	Of the unworthiest siege.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	What part is that, my lord?</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	A very riband in the cap of youth,<br />
	Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes<br />
	The light and careless livery that it wears<br />
	Than settled age his sables and his weeds,<br />
	Importing health and graveness. Two months since,<br />
	Here was a gentleman of Normandy:&mdash;<br />
	I&#39;ve seen myself, and served against, the French,<br />
	And they can well on horseback: but this gallant<br />
	Had witchcraft in&#39;t; he grew unto his seat;<br />
	And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,<br />
	As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured<br />
	With the brave beast: so far he topp&#39;d my thought,<br />
	That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,<br />
	Come short of what he did.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	A Norman was&#39;t?</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	A Norman.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Upon my life, Lamond.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	The very same.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	I know him well: he is the brooch indeed<br />
	And gem of all the nation.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	He made confession of you,<br />
	And gave you such a masterly report<br />
	For art and exercise in your defence<br />
	And for your rapier most especially,<br />
	That he cried out, &#39;twould be a sight indeed,<br />
	If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,<br />
	He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,<br />
	If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his<br />
	Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy<br />
	That he could nothing do but wish and beg<br />
	Your sudden coming o&#39;er, to play with him.<br />
	Now, out of this,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	What out of this, my lord?</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Laertes, was your father dear to you?<br />
	Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,<br />
	A face without a heart?</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Why ask you this?</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Not that I think you did not love your father;<br />
	But that I know love is begun by time;<br />
	And that I see, in passages of proof,<br />
	Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.<br />
	There lives within the very flame of love<br />
	A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;<br />
	And nothing is at a like goodness still;<br />
	For goodness, growing to a plurisy,<br />
	Dies in his own too much: that we would do<br />
	We should do when we would; for this &#39;would&#39; changes<br />
	And hath abatements and delays as many<br />
	As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;<br />
	And then this &#39;should&#39; is like a spendthrift sigh,<br />
	That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o&#39; the ulcer:&mdash;<br />
	Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,<br />
	To show yourself your father&#39;s son in deed<br />
	More than in words?</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	To cut his throat i&#39; the church.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;<br />
	Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,<br />
	Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.<br />
	Hamlet return&#39;d shall know you are come home:<br />
	We&#39;ll put on those shall praise your excellence<br />
	And set a double varnish on the fame<br />
	The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together<br />
	And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,<br />
	Most generous and free from all contriving,<br />
	Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,<br />
	Or with a little shuffling, you may choose<br />
	A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise<br />
	Requite him for your father.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	I will do&#39;t:<br />
	And, for that purpose, I&#39;ll anoint my sword.<br />
	I bought an unction of a mountebank,<br />
	So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,<br />
	Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,<br />
	Collected from all simples that have virtue<br />
	Under the moon, can save the thing from death<br />
	That is but scratch&#39;d withal: I&#39;ll touch my point<br />
	With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,<br />
	It may be death.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Let&#39;s further think of this;<br />
	Weigh what convenience both of time and means<br />
	May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,<br />
	And that our drift look through our bad performance,<br />
	&#39;Twere better not assay&#39;d: therefore this project<br />
	Should have a back or second, that might hold,<br />
	If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:<br />
	We&#39;ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha&#39;t.<br />
	When in your motion you are hot and dry&mdash;<br />
	As make your bouts more violent to that end&mdash;<br />
	And that he calls for drink, I&#39;ll have prepared him<br />
	A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,<br />
	If he by chance escape your venom&#39;d stuck,<br />
	Our purpose may hold there.</p>
<p>
	(Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE)</p>
<p>
	How now, sweet queen!</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	One woe doth tread upon another&#39;s heel,<br />
	So fast they follow; your sister&#39;s drown&#39;d, Laertes.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Drown&#39;d! O, where?</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	There is a willow grows aslant a brook,<br />
	That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;<br />
	There with fantastic garlands did she come<br />
	Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples<br />
	That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,<br />
	But our cold maids do dead men&#39;s fingers call them:<br />
	There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds<br />
	Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;<br />
	When down her weedy trophies and herself<br />
	Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;<br />
	And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:<br />
	Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;<br />
	As one incapable of her own distress,<br />
	Or like a creature native and indued<br />
	Unto that element: but long it could not be<br />
	Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,<br />
	Pull&#39;d the poor wretch from her melodious lay<br />
	To muddy death.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Alas, then, she is drown&#39;d?</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Drown&#39;d, drown&#39;d.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,<br />
	And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet<br />
	It is our trick; nature her custom holds,<br />
	Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,<br />
	The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:<br />
	I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,<br />
	But that this folly douts it.</p>
<p>
	Exit</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Let&#39;s follow, Gertrude:<br />
	How much I had to do to calm his rage!<br />
	Now fear I this will give it start again;<br />
	Therefore let&#39;s follow.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt)</p>
