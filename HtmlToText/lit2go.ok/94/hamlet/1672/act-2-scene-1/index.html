	ACT II</p>
<p>
	SCENE I. A room in POLONIUS&#39; house.</p>
<p>
	(Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO)</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.</p>
<p>
	REYNALDO<br />
	I will, my lord.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,<br />
	Before you visit him, to make inquire<br />
	Of his behavior.</p>
<p>
	REYNALDO<br />
	My lord, I did intend it.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,<br />
	Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;<br />
	And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,<br />
	What company, at what expense; and finding<br />
	By this encompassment and drift of question<br />
	That they do know my son, come you more nearer<br />
	Than your particular demands will touch it:<br />
	Take you, as &#39;twere, some distant knowledge of him;<br />
	As thus, &#39;I know his father and his friends,<br />
	And in part him: &#39; do you mark this, Reynaldo?</p>
<p>
	REYNALDO<br />
	Ay, very well, my lord.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	&#39;And in part him; but&#39; you may say &#39;not well:<br />
	But, if&#39;t be he I mean, he&#39;s very wild;<br />
	Addicted so and so:&#39; and there put on him<br />
	What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank<br />
	As may dishonour him; take heed of that;<br />
	But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips<br />
	As are companions noted and most known<br />
	To youth and liberty.</p>
<p>
	REYNALDO<br />
	As gaming, my lord.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,<br />
	Drabbing: you may go so far.</p>
<p>
	REYNALDO<br />
	My lord, that would dishonour him.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	&#39;Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge<br />
	You must not put another scandal on him,<br />
	That he is open to incontinency;<br />
	That&#39;s not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly<br />
	That they may seem the taints of liberty,<br />
	The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,<br />
	A savageness in unreclaimed blood,<br />
	Of general assault.</p>
<p>
	REYNALDO<br />
	But, my good lord,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Wherefore should you do this?</p>
<p>
	REYNALDO<br />
	Ay, my lord,<br />
	I would know that.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Marry, sir, here&#39;s my drift;<br />
	And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:<br />
	You laying these slight sullies on my son,<br />
	As &#39;twere a thing a little soil&#39;d i&#39; the working, Mark you,<br />
	Your party in converse, him you would sound,<br />
	Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes<br />
	The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured<br />
	He closes with you in this consequence;<br />
	&#39;Good sir,&#39; or so, or &#39;friend,&#39; or &#39;gentleman,&#39;<br />
	According to the phrase or the addition<br />
	Of man and country.</p>
<p>
	REYNALDO<br />
	Very good, my lord.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	And then, sir, does he this&mdash;he does&mdash;what was I<br />
	about to say? By the mass, I was about to say<br />
	something: where did I leave?</p>
<p>
	REYNALDO<br />
	At &#39;closes in the consequence,&#39; at &#39;friend or so,&#39;<br />
	and &#39;gentleman.&#39;</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	At &#39;closes in the consequence,&#39; ay, marry;<br />
	He closes thus: &#39;I know the gentleman;<br />
	I saw him yesterday, or t&#39; other day,<br />
	Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,<br />
	There was a&#39; gaming; there o&#39;ertook in&#39;s rouse;<br />
	There falling out at tennis:&#39; or perchance,<br />
	&#39;I saw him enter such a house of sale,&#39;<br />
	Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.<br />
	See you now;<br />
	Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:<br />
	And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,<br />
	With windlasses and with assays of bias,<br />
	By indirections find directions out:<br />
	So by my former lecture and advice,<br />
	Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?</p>
<p>
	REYNALDO<br />
	My lord, I have.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	God be wi&#39; you; fare you well.</p>
<p>
	REYNALDO<br />
	Good my lord!</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Observe his inclination in yourself.</p>
<p>
	REYNALDO<br />
	I shall, my lord.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	And let him ply his music.</p>
<p>
	REYNALDO<br />
	Well, my lord.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Farewell!</p>
<p>
	(Exit REYNALDO)</p>
<p>
	(Enter OPHELIA)</p>
<p>
	How now, Ophelia! what&#39;s the matter?</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	With what, i&#39; the name of God?</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,<br />
	Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;<br />
	No hat upon his head; his stockings foul&#39;d,<br />
	Ungarter&#39;d, and down-gyved to his ancle;<br />
	Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;<br />
	And with a look so piteous in purport<br />
	As if he had been loosed out of hell<br />
	To speak of horrors,&mdash;he comes before me.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Mad for thy love?</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	My lord, I do not know;<br />
	But truly, I do fear it.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	What said he?</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	He took me by the wrist and held me hard;<br />
	Then goes he to the length of all his arm;<br />
	And, with his other hand thus o&#39;er his brow,<br />
	He falls to such perusal of my face<br />
	As he would draw it. Long stay&#39;d he so;<br />
	At last, a little shaking of mine arm<br />
	And thrice his head thus waving up and down,<br />
	He raised a sigh so piteous and profound<br />
	As it did seem to shatter all his bulk<br />
	And end his being: that done, he lets me go:<br />
	And, with his head over his shoulder turn&#39;d,<br />
	He seem&#39;d to find his way without his eyes;<br />
	For out o&#39; doors he went without their helps,<br />
	And, to the last, bended their light on me.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.<br />
	This is the very ecstasy of love,<br />
	Whose violent property fordoes itself<br />
	And leads the will to desperate undertakings<br />
	As oft as any passion under heaven<br />
	That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.<br />
	What, have you given him any hard words of late?</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	No, my good lord, but, as you did command,<br />
	I did repel his fetters and denied<br />
	His access to me.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	That hath made him mad.<br />
	I am sorry that with better heed and judgment<br />
	I had not quoted him: I fear&#39;d he did but trifle,<br />
	And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!<br />
	By heaven, it is as proper to our age<br />
	To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions<br />
	As it is common for the younger sort<br />
	To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:<br />
	This must be known; which, being kept close, might move<br />
	More grief to hide than hate to utter love.</p>
