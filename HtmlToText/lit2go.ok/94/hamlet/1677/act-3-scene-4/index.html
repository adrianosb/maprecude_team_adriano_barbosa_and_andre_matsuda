	SCENE IV. The Queen&#39;s closet.</p>
<p>
	(Enter QUEEN MARGARET and POLONIUS)</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:<br />
	Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,<br />
	And that your grace hath screen&#39;d and stood between<br />
	Much heat and him. I&#39;ll sconce me even here.<br />
	Pray you, be round with him.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	[Within] Mother, mother, mother!</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	I&#39;ll warrant you,<br />
	Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.</p>
<p>
	POLONIUS hides behind the arras</p>
<p>
	(Enter HAMLET)</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Now, mother, what&#39;s the matter?</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Mother, you have my father much offended.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Why, how now, Hamlet!</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	What&#39;s the matter now?</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Have you forgot me?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	No, by the rood, not so:<br />
	You are the queen, your husband&#39;s brother&#39;s wife;<br />
	And&mdash;would it were not so!&mdash;you are my mother.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Nay, then, I&#39;ll set those to you that can speak.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;<br />
	You go not till I set you up a glass<br />
	Where you may see the inmost part of you.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?<br />
	Help, help, ho!</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	[Behind] What, ho! help, help, help!</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	[Drawing] How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!</p>
<p>
	(Makes a pass through the arras)</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	[Behind] O, I am slain!</p>
<p>
	(Falls and dies)</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	O me, what hast thou done?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Nay, I know not:<br />
	Is it the king?</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,<br />
	As kill a king, and marry with his brother.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	As kill a king!</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Ay, lady, &#39;twas my word.</p>
<p>
	(Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS)</p>
<p>
	Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!<br />
	I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;<br />
	Thou find&#39;st to be too busy is some danger.<br />
	Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,<br />
	And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,<br />
	If it be made of penetrable stuff,<br />
	If damned custom have not brass&#39;d it so<br />
	That it is proof and bulwark against sense.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue<br />
	In noise so rude against me?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Such an act<br />
	That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,<br />
	Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose<br />
	From the fair forehead of an innocent love<br />
	And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows<br />
	As false as dicers&#39; oaths: O, such a deed<br />
	As from the body of contraction plucks<br />
	The very soul, and sweet religion makes<br />
	A rhapsody of words: heaven&#39;s face doth glow:<br />
	Yea, this solidity and compound mass,<br />
	With tristful visage, as against the doom,<br />
	Is thought-sick at the act.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Ay me, what act,<br />
	That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Look here, upon this picture, and on this,<br />
	The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.<br />
	See, what a grace was seated on this brow;<br />
	Hyperion&#39;s curls; the front of Jove himself;<br />
	An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;<br />
	A station like the herald Mercury<br />
	New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;<br />
	A combination and a form indeed,<br />
	Where every god did seem to set his seal,<br />
	To give the world assurance of a man:<br />
	This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:<br />
	Here is your husband; like a mildew&#39;d ear,<br />
	Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?<br />
	Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,<br />
	And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?<br />
	You cannot call it love; for at your age<br />
	The hey-day in the blood is tame, it&#39;s humble,<br />
	And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment<br />
	Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,<br />
	Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense<br />
	Is apoplex&#39;d; for madness would not err,<br />
	Nor sense to ecstasy was ne&#39;er so thrall&#39;d<br />
	But it reserved some quantity of choice,<br />
	To serve in such a difference. What devil was&#39;t<br />
	That thus hath cozen&#39;d you at hoodman-blind?<br />
	Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,<br />
	Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,<br />
	Or but a sickly part of one true sense<br />
	Could not so mope.<br />
	O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,<br />
	If thou canst mutine in a matron&#39;s bones,<br />
	To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,<br />
	And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame<br />
	When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,<br />
	Since frost itself as actively doth burn<br />
	And reason panders will.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	O Hamlet, speak no more:<br />
	Thou turn&#39;st mine eyes into my very soul;<br />
	And there I see such black and grained spots<br />
	As will not leave their tinct.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Nay, but to live<br />
	In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,<br />
	Stew&#39;d in corruption, honeying and making love<br />
	Over the nasty sty,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	O, speak to me no more;<br />
	These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;<br />
	No more, sweet Hamlet!</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	A murderer and a villain;<br />
	A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe<br />
	Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;<br />
	A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,<br />
	That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,<br />
	And put it in his pocket!</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	No more!</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	A king of shreds and patches,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	(Enter Ghost)</p>
<p>
	Save me, and hover o&#39;er me with your wings,<br />
	You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Alas, he&#39;s mad!</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Do you not come your tardy son to chide,<br />
	That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by<br />
	The important acting of your dread command? O, say!</p>
<p>
	Ghost<br />
	Do not forget: this visitation<br />
	Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.<br />
	But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:<br />
	O, step between her and her fighting soul:<br />
	Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:<br />
	Speak to her, Hamlet.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	How is it with you, lady?</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Alas, how is&#39;t with you,<br />
	That you do bend your eye on vacancy<br />
	And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?<br />
	Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;<br />
	And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,<br />
	Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,<br />
	Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,<br />
	Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper<br />
	Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!<br />
	His form and cause conjoin&#39;d, preaching to stones,<br />
	Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;<br />
	Lest with this piteous action you convert<br />
	My stern effects: then what I have to do<br />
	Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	To whom do you speak this?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Do you see nothing there?</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Nor did you nothing hear?</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	No, nothing but ourselves.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!<br />
	My father, in his habit as he lived!<br />
	Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!</p>
<p>
	(Exit Ghost)</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	This the very coinage of your brain:<br />
	This bodiless creation ecstasy<br />
	Is very cunning in.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Ecstasy!<br />
	My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,<br />
	And makes as healthful music: it is not madness<br />
	That I have utter&#39;d: bring me to the test,<br />
	And I the matter will re-word; which madness<br />
	Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,<br />
	Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,<br />
	That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:<br />
	It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,<br />
	Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,<br />
	Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;<br />
	Repent what&#39;s past; avoid what is to come;<br />
	And do not spread the compost on the weeds,<br />
	To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;<br />
	For in the fatness of these pursy times<br />
	Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,<br />
	Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	O, throw away the worser part of it,<br />
	And live the purer with the other half.<br />
	Good night: but go not to mine uncle&#39;s bed;<br />
	Assume a virtue, if you have it not.<br />
	That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,<br />
	Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,<br />
	That to the use of actions fair and good<br />
	He likewise gives a frock or livery,<br />
	That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,<br />
	And that shall lend a kind of easiness<br />
	To the next abstinence: the next more easy;<br />
	For use almost can change the stamp of nature,<br />
	And either [ ] the devil, or throw him out<br />
	With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:<br />
	And when you are desirous to be bless&#39;d,<br />
	I&#39;ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,</p>
<p>
	(Pointing to POLONIUS)</p>
<p>
	I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,<br />
	To punish me with this and this with me,<br />
	That I must be their scourge and minister.<br />
	I will bestow him, and will answer well<br />
	The death I gave him. So, again, good night.<br />
	I must be cruel, only to be kind:<br />
	Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.<br />
	One word more, good lady.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	What shall I do?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:<br />
	Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;<br />
	Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;<br />
	And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,<br />
	Or paddling in your neck with his damn&#39;d fingers,<br />
	Make you to ravel all this matter out,<br />
	That I essentially am not in madness,<br />
	But mad in craft. &#39;Twere good you let him know;<br />
	For who, that&#39;s but a queen, fair, sober, wise,<br />
	Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,<br />
	Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?<br />
	No, in despite of sense and secrecy,<br />
	Unpeg the basket on the house&#39;s top.<br />
	Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,<br />
	To try conclusions, in the basket creep,<br />
	And break your own neck down.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,<br />
	And breath of life, I have no life to breathe<br />
	What thou hast said to me.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I must to England; you know that?</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Alack,<br />
	I had forgot: &#39;tis so concluded on.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	There&#39;s letters seal&#39;d: and my two schoolfellows,<br />
	Whom I will trust as I will adders fang&#39;d,<br />
	They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,<br />
	And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;<br />
	For &#39;tis the sport to have the engineer<br />
	Hoist with his own petard: and &#39;t shall go hard<br />
	But I will delve one yard below their mines,<br />
	And blow them at the moon: O, &#39;tis most sweet,<br />
	When in one line two crafts directly meet.<br />
	This man shall set me packing:<br />
	I&#39;ll lug the guts into the neighbour room.<br />
	Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor<br />
	Is now most still, most secret and most grave,<br />
	Who was in life a foolish prating knave.<br />
	Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.<br />
	Good night, mother.</p>
