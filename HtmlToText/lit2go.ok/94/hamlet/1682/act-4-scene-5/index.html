	SCENE V. Elsinore. A room in the castle.</p>
<p>
	(Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE, HORATIO, and a Gentleman)</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	I will not speak with her.</p>
<p>
	Gentleman<br />
	She is importunate, indeed distract:<br />
	Her mood will needs be pitied.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	What would she have?</p>
<p>
	Gentleman<br />
	She speaks much of her father; says she hears<br />
	There&#39;s tricks i&#39; the world; and hems, and beats her heart;<br />
	Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,<br />
	That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,<br />
	Yet the unshaped use of it doth move<br />
	The hearers to collection; they aim at it,<br />
	And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;<br />
	Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,<br />
	Indeed would make one think there might be thought,<br />
	Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	&#39;Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew<br />
	Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Let her come in.</p>
<p>
	(Exit HORATIO)</p>
<p>
	To my sick soul, as sin&#39;s true nature is,<br />
	Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:<br />
	So full of artless jealousy is guilt,<br />
	It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.</p>
<p>
	(Re-enter HORATIO, with OPHELIA)</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	How now, Ophelia!</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	[Sings]<br />
	How should I your true love know<br />
	From another one?<br />
	By his cockle hat and staff,<br />
	And his sandal shoon.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	Say you? nay, pray you, mark.</p>
<p>
	[Sings]</p>
<p>
	He is dead and gone, lady,<br />
	He is dead and gone;<br />
	At his head a grass-green turf,<br />
	At his heels a stone.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Nay, but, Ophelia,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	Pray you, mark.</p>
<p>
	[Sings]</p>
<p>
	White his shroud as the mountain snow,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	(Enter KING CLAUDIUS)</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Alas, look here, my lord.</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	[Sings]<br />
	Larded with sweet flowers<br />
	Which bewept to the grave did go<br />
	With true-love showers.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	How do you, pretty lady?</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	Well, God &#39;ild you! They say the owl was a baker&#39;s<br />
	daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not<br />
	what we may be. God be at your table!</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Conceit upon her father.</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	Pray you, let&#39;s have no words of this; but when they<br />
	ask you what it means, say you this:</p>
<p>
	[Sings]</p>
<p>
	To-morrow is Saint Valentine&#39;s day,<br />
	All in the morning betime,<br />
	And I a maid at your window,<br />
	To be your Valentine.<br />
	Then up he rose, and donn&#39;d his clothes,<br />
	And dupp&#39;d the chamber-door;<br />
	Let in the maid, that out a maid<br />
	Never departed more.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Pretty Ophelia!</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	Indeed, la, without an oath, I&#39;ll make an end on&#39;t:</p>
<p>
	[Sings]</p>
<p>
	By Gis and by Saint Charity,<br />
	Alack, and fie for shame!<br />
	Young men will do&#39;t, if they come to&#39;t;<br />
	By cock, they are to blame.<br />
	Quoth she, before you tumbled me,<br />
	You promised me to wed.<br />
	So would I ha&#39; done, by yonder sun,<br />
	An thou hadst not come to my bed.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	How long hath she been thus?</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I<br />
	cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him<br />
	i&#39; the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:<br />
	and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my<br />
	coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;<br />
	good night, good night.</p>
<p>
	(Exit)</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Follow her close; give her good watch,<br />
	I pray you.</p>
<p>
	(Exit HORATIO)</p>
<p>
	O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs<br />
	All from her father&#39;s death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,<br />
	When sorrows come, they come not single spies<br />
	But in battalions. First, her father slain:<br />
	Next, your son gone; and he most violent author<br />
	Of his own just remove: the people muddied,<br />
	Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,<br />
	For good Polonius&#39; death; and we have done but greenly,<br />
	In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia<br />
	Divided from herself and her fair judgment,<br />
	Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:<br />
	Last, and as much containing as all these,<br />
	Her brother is in secret come from France;<br />
	Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,<br />
	And wants not buzzers to infect his ear<br />
	With pestilent speeches of his father&#39;s death;<br />
	Wherein necessity, of matter beggar&#39;d,<br />
	Will nothing stick our person to arraign<br />
	In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,<br />
	Like to a murdering-piece, in many places<br />
	Gives me superfluous death.</p>
<p>
	[A noise within]</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Alack, what noise is this?</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.</p>
<p>
	(Enter another Gentleman)</p>
<p>
	What is the matter?</p>
<p>
	Gentleman<br />
	Save yourself, my lord:<br />
	The ocean, overpeering of his list,<br />
	Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste<br />
	Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,<br />
	O&#39;erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;<br />
	And, as the world were now but to begin,<br />
	Antiquity forgot, custom not known,<br />
	The ratifiers and props of every word,<br />
	They cry &#39;Choose we: Laertes shall be king:&#39;<br />
	Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:<br />
	&#39;Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!&#39;</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!<br />
	O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	The doors are broke.</p>
<p>
	[Noise within]</p>
<p>
	(Enter LAERTES, armed; Danes following)</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.</p>
<p>
	Danes<br />
	No, let&#39;s come in.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	I pray you, give me leave.</p>
<p>
	Danes<br />
	We will, we will.</p>
<p>
	(They retire without the door)</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,<br />
	Give me my father!</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Calmly, good Laertes.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	That drop of blood that&#39;s calm proclaims me bastard,<br />
	Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot<br />
	Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow<br />
	Of my true mother.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	What is the cause, Laertes,<br />
	That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?<br />
	Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:<br />
	There&#39;s such divinity doth hedge a king,<br />
	That treason can but peep to what it would,<br />
	Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,<br />
	Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.<br />
	Speak, man.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Where is my father?</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Dead.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	But not by him.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Let him demand his fill.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	How came he dead? I&#39;ll not be juggled with:<br />
	To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!<br />
	Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!<br />
	I dare damnation. To this point I stand,<br />
	That both the worlds I give to negligence,<br />
	Let come what comes; only I&#39;ll be revenged<br />
	Most thoroughly for my father.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Who shall stay you?</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	My will, not all the world:<br />
	And for my means, I&#39;ll husband them so well,<br />
	They shall go far with little.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Good Laertes,<br />
	If you desire to know the certainty<br />
	Of your dear father&#39;s death, is&#39;t writ in your revenge,<br />
	That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,<br />
	Winner and loser?</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	None but his enemies.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Will you know them then?</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	To his good friends thus wide I&#39;ll ope my arms;<br />
	And like the kind life-rendering pelican,<br />
	Repast them with my blood.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Why, now you speak<br />
	Like a good child and a true gentleman.<br />
	That I am guiltless of your father&#39;s death,<br />
	And am most sensible in grief for it,<br />
	It shall as level to your judgment pierce<br />
	As day does to your eye.</p>
<p>
	Danes<br />
	[Within] Let her come in.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	How now! what noise is that?</p>
<p>
	(Re-enter OPHELIA)</p>
<p>
	O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,<br />
	Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!<br />
	By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,<br />
	Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!<br />
	Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!<br />
	O heavens! is&#39;t possible, a young maid&#39;s wits<br />
	Should be as moral as an old man&#39;s life?<br />
	Nature is fine in love, and where &#39;tis fine,<br />
	It sends some precious instance of itself<br />
	After the thing it loves.</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	[Sings]<br />
	They bore him barefaced on the bier;<br />
	Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;<br />
	And in his grave rain&#39;d many a tear:&mdash;<br />
	Fare you well, my dove!</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,<br />
	It could not move thus.</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	[Sings]<br />
	You must sing a-down a-down,<br />
	An you call him a-down-a.<br />
	O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false<br />
	steward, that stole his master&#39;s daughter.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	This nothing&#39;s more than matter.</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	There&#39;s rosemary, that&#39;s for remembrance; pray,<br />
	love, remember: and there is pansies. that&#39;s for thoughts.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	There&#39;s fennel for you, and columbines: there&#39;s rue<br />
	for you; and here&#39;s some for me: we may call it<br />
	herb-grace o&#39; Sundays: O you must wear your rue with<br />
	a difference. There&#39;s a daisy: I would give you<br />
	some violets, but they withered all when my father<br />
	died: they say he made a good end,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	[Sings]</p>
<p>
	For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,<br />
	She turns to favour and to prettiness.</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	[Sings]<br />
	And will he not come again?<br />
	And will he not come again?<br />
	No, no, he is dead:<br />
	Go to thy death-bed:<br />
	He never will come again.<br />
	His beard was as white as snow,<br />
	All flaxen was his poll:<br />
	He is gone, he is gone,<br />
	And we cast away moan:<br />
	God ha&#39; mercy on his soul!<br />
	And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi&#39; ye.</p>
<p>
	(Exit)</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Do you see this, O God?</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Laertes, I must commune with your grief,<br />
	Or you deny me right. Go but apart,<br />
	Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.<br />
	And they shall hear and judge &#39;twixt you and me:<br />
	If by direct or by collateral hand<br />
	They find us touch&#39;d, we will our kingdom give,<br />
	Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,<br />
	To you in satisfaction; but if not,<br />
	Be you content to lend your patience to us,<br />
	And we shall jointly labour with your soul<br />
	To give it due content.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Let this be so;<br />
	His means of death, his obscure funeral&mdash;<br />
	No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o&#39;er his bones,<br />
	No noble rite nor formal ostentation&mdash;<br />
	Cry to be heard, as &#39;twere from heaven to earth,<br />
	That I must call&#39;t in question.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	So you shall;<br />
	And where the offence is let the great axe fall.<br />
	I pray you, go with me.</p>
<p>
