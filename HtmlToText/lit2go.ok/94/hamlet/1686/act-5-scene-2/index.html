	SCENE II. A hall in the castle.</p>
<p>
	(Enter HAMLET and HORATIO)</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;<br />
	You do remember all the circumstance?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Remember it, my lord?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,<br />
	That would not let me sleep: methought I lay<br />
	Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,<br />
	And praised be rashness for it, let us know,<br />
	Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,<br />
	When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us<br />
	There&#39;s a divinity that shapes our ends,<br />
	Rough-hew them how we will,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	That is most certain.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Up from my cabin,<br />
	My sea-gown scarf&#39;d about me, in the dark<br />
	Groped I to find out them; had my desire.<br />
	Finger&#39;d their packet, and in fine withdrew<br />
	To mine own room again; making so bold,<br />
	My fears forgetting manners, to unseal<br />
	Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,&mdash;<br />
	O royal knavery!&mdash;an exact command,<br />
	Larded with many several sorts of reasons<br />
	Importing Denmark&#39;s health and England&#39;s too,<br />
	With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,<br />
	That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,<br />
	No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,<br />
	My head should be struck off.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Is&#39;t possible?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Here&#39;s the commission: read it at more leisure.<br />
	But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	I beseech you.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Being thus be-netted round with villanies,&mdash;<br />
	Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,<br />
	They had begun the play&mdash;I sat me down,<br />
	Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:<br />
	I once did hold it, as our statists do,<br />
	A baseness to write fair and labour&#39;d much<br />
	How to forget that learning, but, sir, now<br />
	It did me yeoman&#39;s service: wilt thou know<br />
	The effect of what I wrote?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Ay, good my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	An earnest conjuration from the king,<br />
	As England was his faithful tributary,<br />
	As love between them like the palm might flourish,<br />
	As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear<br />
	And stand a comma &#39;tween their amities,<br />
	And many such-like &#39;As&#39;es of great charge,<br />
	That, on the view and knowing of these contents,<br />
	Without debatement further, more or less,<br />
	He should the bearers put to sudden death,<br />
	Not shriving-time allow&#39;d.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	How was this seal&#39;d?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.<br />
	I had my father&#39;s signet in my purse,<br />
	Which was the model of that Danish seal;<br />
	Folded the writ up in form of the other,<br />
	Subscribed it, gave&#39;t the impression, placed it safely,<br />
	The changeling never known. Now, the next day<br />
	Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent<br />
	Thou know&#39;st already.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to&#39;t.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Why, man, they did make love to this employment;<br />
	They are not near my conscience; their defeat<br />
	Does by their own insinuation grow:<br />
	&#39;Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes<br />
	Between the pass and fell incensed points<br />
	Of mighty opposites.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Why, what a king is this!</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Does it not, think&#39;st thee, stand me now upon&mdash;<br />
	He that hath kill&#39;d my king and whored my mother,<br />
	Popp&#39;d in between the election and my hopes,<br />
	Thrown out his angle for my proper life,<br />
	And with such cozenage&mdash;is&#39;t not perfect conscience,<br />
	To quit him with this arm? and is&#39;t not to be damn&#39;d,<br />
	To let this canker of our nature come<br />
	In further evil?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	It must be shortly known to him from England<br />
	What is the issue of the business there.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	It will be short: the interim is mine;<br />
	And a man&#39;s life&#39;s no more than to say &#39;One.&#39;<br />
	But I am very sorry, good Horatio,<br />
	That to Laertes I forgot myself;<br />
	For, by the image of my cause, I see<br />
	The portraiture of his: I&#39;ll court his favours.<br />
	But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me<br />
	Into a towering passion.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Peace! who comes here?</p>
<p>
	(Enter OSRIC)</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	No, my good lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Thy state is the more gracious; for &#39;tis a vice to<br />
	know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a<br />
	beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at<br />
	the king&#39;s mess: &#39;tis a chough; but, as I say,<br />
	spacious in the possession of dirt.</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I<br />
	should impart a thing to you from his majesty.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of<br />
	spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; &#39;tis for the head.</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	I thank your lordship, it is very hot.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	No, believe me, &#39;tis very cold; the wind is<br />
	northerly.</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my<br />
	complexion.</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,&mdash;as<br />
	&#39;twere,&mdash;I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his<br />
	majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a<br />
	great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I beseech you, remember&mdash;</p>
<p>
	(HAMLET moves him to put on his hat)</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.<br />
	Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe<br />
	me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent<br />
	differences, of very soft society and great showing:<br />
	indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or<br />
	calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the<br />
	continent of what part a gentleman would see.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;<br />
	though, I know, to divide him inventorially would<br />
	dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw<br />
	neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the<br />
	verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of<br />
	great article; and his infusion of such dearth and<br />
	rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his<br />
	semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace<br />
	him, his umbrage, nothing more.</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman<br />
	in our more rawer breath?</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	Sir?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Is&#39;t not possible to understand in another tongue?<br />
	You will do&#39;t, sir, really.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	What imports the nomination of this gentleman?</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	Of Laertes?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	His purse is empty already; all&#39;s golden words are spent.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Of him, sir.</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	I know you are not ignorant&mdash;</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,<br />
	it would not much approve me. Well, sir?</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is&mdash;</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with<br />
	him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to<br />
	know himself.</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation<br />
	laid on him by them, in his meed he&#39;s unfellowed.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	What&#39;s his weapon?</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	Rapier and dagger.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	That&#39;s two of his weapons: but, well.</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary<br />
	horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take<br />
	it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their<br />
	assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the<br />
	carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very<br />
	responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,<br />
	and of very liberal conceit.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	What call you the carriages?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	The carriages, sir, are the hangers.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we<br />
	could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might<br />
	be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses<br />
	against six French swords, their assigns, and three<br />
	liberal-conceited carriages; that&#39;s the French bet<br />
	against the Danish. Why is this &#39;imponed,&#39; as you call it?</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes<br />
	between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you<br />
	three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it<br />
	would come to immediate trial, if your lordship<br />
	would vouchsafe the answer.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	How if I answer &#39;no&#39;?</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his<br />
	majesty, &#39;tis the breathing time of day with me; let<br />
	the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the<br />
	king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;<br />
	if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	Shall I re-deliver you e&#39;en so?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	I commend my duty to your lordship.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Yours, yours.</p>
<p>
	(Exit OSRIC)</p>
<p>
	He does well to commend it himself; there are no<br />
	tongues else for&#39;s turn.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.<br />
	Thus has he&mdash;and many more of the same bevy that I<br />
	know the dressy age dotes on&mdash;only got the tune of<br />
	the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of<br />
	yesty collection, which carries them through and<br />
	through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do<br />
	but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.<br />
	Enter a Lord</p>
<p>
	Lord<br />
	My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young<br />
	Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in<br />
	the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to<br />
	play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king&#39;s<br />
	pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now<br />
	or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.</p>
<p>
	Lord<br />
	The king and queen and all are coming down.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	In happy time.</p>
<p>
	Lord<br />
	The queen desires you to use some gentle<br />
	entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	She well instructs me.</p>
<p>
	(Exit Lord)</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	You will lose this wager, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I do not think so: since he went into France, I<br />
	have been in continual practise: I shall win at the<br />
	odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all&#39;s here<br />
	about my heart: but it is no matter.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Nay, good my lord,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of<br />
	gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will<br />
	forestall their repair hither, and say you are not<br />
	fit.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Not a whit, we defy augury: there&#39;s a special<br />
	providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,<br />
	&#39;tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be<br />
	now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the<br />
	readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he<br />
	leaves, what is&#39;t to leave betimes?</p>
<br />
<p>
	(Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, &amp; c)</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.</p>
<p>
	(KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES&#39; hand into HAMLET&#39;s)</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Give me your pardon, sir: I&#39;ve done you wrong;<br />
	But pardon&#39;t, as you are a gentleman.<br />
	This presence knows,<br />
	And you must needs have heard, how I am punish&#39;d<br />
	With sore distraction. What I have done,<br />
	That might your nature, honour and exception<br />
	Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.<br />
	Was&#39;t Hamlet wrong&#39;d Laertes? Never Hamlet:<br />
	If Hamlet from himself be ta&#39;en away,<br />
	And when he&#39;s not himself does wrong Laertes,<br />
	Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.<br />
	Who does it, then? His madness: if&#39;t be so,<br />
	Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong&#39;d;<br />
	His madness is poor Hamlet&#39;s enemy.<br />
	Sir, in this audience,<br />
	Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil<br />
	Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,<br />
	That I have shot mine arrow o&#39;er the house,<br />
	And hurt my brother.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	I am satisfied in nature,<br />
	Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most<br />
	To my revenge: but in my terms of honour<br />
	I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,<br />
	Till by some elder masters, of known honour,<br />
	I have a voice and precedent of peace,<br />
	To keep my name ungored. But till that time,<br />
	I do receive your offer&#39;d love like love,<br />
	And will not wrong it.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I embrace it freely;<br />
	And will this brother&#39;s wager frankly play.<br />
	Give us the foils. Come on.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Come, one for me.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I&#39;ll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance<br />
	Your skill shall, like a star i&#39; the darkest night,<br />
	Stick fiery off indeed.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	You mock me, sir.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	No, by this hand.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,<br />
	You know the wager?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Very well, my lord<br />
	Your grace hath laid the odds o&#39; the weaker side.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	I do not fear it; I have seen you both:<br />
	But since he is better&#39;d, we have therefore odds.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	This is too heavy, let me see another.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	This likes me well. These foils have all a length?</p>
<p>
	(They prepare to play)</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.<br />
	If Hamlet give the first or second hit,<br />
	Or quit in answer of the third exchange,<br />
	Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:<br />
	The king shall drink to Hamlet&#39;s better breath;<br />
	And in the cup an union shall he throw,<br />
	Richer than that which four successive kings<br />
	In Denmark&#39;s crown have worn. Give me the cups;<br />
	And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,<br />
	The trumpet to the cannoneer without,<br />
	The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,<br />
	&#39;Now the king dunks to Hamlet.&#39; Come, begin:<br />
	And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Come on, sir.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Come, my lord.</p>
<p>
	(They play)</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	One.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	No.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Judgment.</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	A hit, a very palpable hit.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Well; again.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;<br />
	Here&#39;s to thy health.</p>
<p>
	[Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within]</p>
<p>
	Give him the cup.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I&#39;ll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.</p>
<p>
	(They play)</p>
<p>
	Another hit; what say you?</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	A touch, a touch, I do confess.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Our son shall win.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	He&#39;s fat, and scant of breath.<br />
	Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;<br />
	The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Good madam!</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Gertrude, do not drink.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	[Aside] It is the poison&#39;d cup: it is too late.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Come, let me wipe thy face.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	My lord, I&#39;ll hit him now.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	I do not think&#39;t.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	[Aside] And yet &#39;tis almost &#39;gainst my conscience.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;<br />
	I pray you, pass with your best violence;<br />
	I am afeard you make a wanton of me.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Say you so? come on.</p>
<p>
	(They play)</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	Nothing, neither way.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Have at you now!</p>
<p>
	LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Part them; they are incensed.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Nay, come, again.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE falls</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	Look to the queen there, ho!</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	How is&#39;t, Laertes?</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;<br />
	I am justly kill&#39;d with mine own treachery.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	How does the queen?</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	She swounds to see them bleed.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	No, no, the drink, the drink,&mdash;O my dear Hamlet,&mdash;<br />
	The drink, the drink! I am poison&#39;d.</p>
<p>
	(Dies)</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	O villany! Ho! let the door be lock&#39;d:<br />
	Treachery! Seek it out.</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;<br />
	No medicine in the world can do thee good;<br />
	In thee there is not half an hour of life;<br />
	The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,<br />
	Unbated and envenom&#39;d: the foul practise<br />
	Hath turn&#39;d itself on me lo, here I lie,<br />
	Never to rise again: thy mother&#39;s poison&#39;d:<br />
	I can no more: the king, the king&#39;s to blame.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	The point!&mdash;envenom&#39;d too!<br />
	Then, venom, to thy work.</p>
<p>
	(Stabs KING CLAUDIUS)</p>
<p>
	All<br />
	Treason! treason!</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,<br />
	Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?<br />
	Follow my mother.</p>
<p>
	(KING CLAUDIUS dies)</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	He is justly served;<br />
	It is a poison temper&#39;d by himself.<br />
	Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:<br />
	Mine and my father&#39;s death come not upon thee,<br />
	Nor thine on me.</p>
<p>
	(Dies)</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.<br />
	I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!<br />
	You that look pale and tremble at this chance,<br />
	That are but mutes or audience to this act,<br />
	Had I but time&mdash;as this fell sergeant, death,<br />
	Is strict in his arrest&mdash;O, I could tell you&mdash;<br />
	But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;<br />
	Thou livest; report me and my cause aright<br />
	To the unsatisfied.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Never believe it:<br />
	I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:<br />
	Here&#39;s yet some liquor left.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	As thou&#39;rt a man,<br />
	Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I&#39;ll have&#39;t.<br />
	O good Horatio, what a wounded name,<br />
	Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!<br />
	If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart<br />
	Absent thee from felicity awhile,<br />
	And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,<br />
	To tell my story.</p>
<p>
	[March afar off, and shot within]</p>
<p>
	What warlike noise is this?</p>
<p>
	OSRIC<br />
	Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,<br />
	To the ambassadors of England gives<br />
	This warlike volley.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	O, I die, Horatio;<br />
	The potent poison quite o&#39;er-crows my spirit:<br />
	I cannot live to hear the news from England;<br />
	But I do prophesy the election lights<br />
	On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;<br />
	So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,<br />
	Which have solicited. The rest is silence.</p>
<p>
	(Dies)</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:<br />
	And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!<br />
	Why does the drum come hither?</p>
<p>
	[March within]</p>
<p>
	(Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and others)</p>
<p>
	PRINCE FORTINBRAS<br />
	Where is this sight?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	What is it ye would see?<br />
	If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.</p>
<p>
	PRINCE FORTINBRAS<br />
	This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,<br />
	What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,<br />
	That thou so many princes at a shot<br />
	So bloodily hast struck?</p>
<p>
	First Ambassador<br />
	The sight is dismal;<br />
	And our affairs from England come too late:<br />
	The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,<br />
	To tell him his commandment is fulfill&#39;d,<br />
	That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:<br />
	Where should we have our thanks?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Not from his mouth,<br />
	Had it the ability of life to thank you:<br />
	He never gave commandment for their death.<br />
	But since, so jump upon this bloody question,<br />
	You from the Polack wars, and you from England,<br />
	Are here arrived give order that these bodies<br />
	High on a stage be placed to the view;<br />
	And let me speak to the yet unknowing world<br />
	How these things came about: so shall you hear<br />
	Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,<br />
	Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,<br />
	Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,<br />
	And, in this upshot, purposes mistook<br />
	Fall&#39;n on the inventors&#39; reads: all this can I<br />
	Truly deliver.</p>
<p>
	PRINCE FORTINBRAS<br />
	Let us haste to hear it,<br />
	And call the noblest to the audience.<br />
	For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:<br />
	I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,<br />
	Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Of that I shall have also cause to speak,<br />
	And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;<br />
	But let this same be presently perform&#39;d,<br />
	Even while men&#39;s minds are wild; lest more mischance<br />
	On plots and errors, happen.</p>
<p>
	PRINCE FORTINBRAS<br />
	Let four captains<br />
	Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;<br />
	For he was likely, had he been put on,<br />
	To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,<br />
	The soldiers&#39; music and the rites of war<br />
	Speak loudly for him.<br />
	Take up the bodies: such a sight as this<br />
	Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.<br />
	Go, bid the soldiers shoot.</p>
<p>
	(A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off)</p>
