	ACT III</p>
<p>
	SCENE I. A room in the castle.</p>
<p>
	(Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN)</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	And can you, by no drift of circumstance,<br />
	Get from him why he puts on this confusion,<br />
	Grating so harshly all his days of quiet<br />
	With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	He does confess he feels himself distracted;<br />
	But from what cause he will by no means speak.</p>
<p>
	GUILDENSTERN<br />
	Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,<br />
	But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,<br />
	When we would bring him on to some confession<br />
	Of his true state.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Did he receive you well?</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	Most like a gentleman.</p>
<p>
	GUILDENSTERN<br />
	But with much forcing of his disposition.</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	Niggard of question; but, of our demands,<br />
	Most free in his reply.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Did you assay him?<br />
	To any pastime?</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	Madam, it so fell out, that certain players<br />
	We o&#39;er-raught on the way: of these we told him;<br />
	And there did seem in him a kind of joy<br />
	To hear of it: they are about the court,<br />
	And, as I think, they have already order<br />
	This night to play before him.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	&#39;Tis most true:<br />
	And he beseech&#39;d me to entreat your majesties<br />
	To hear and see the matter.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	With all my heart; and it doth much content me<br />
	To hear him so inclined.<br />
	Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,<br />
	And drive his purpose on to these delights.</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	We shall, my lord.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN)</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;<br />
	For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,<br />
	That he, as &#39;twere by accident, may here<br />
	Affront Ophelia:<br />
	Her father and myself, lawful espials,<br />
	Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,<br />
	We may of their encounter frankly judge,<br />
	And gather by him, as he is behaved,<br />
	If &#39;t be the affliction of his love or no<br />
	That thus he suffers for.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	I shall obey you.<br />
	And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish<br />
	That your good beauties be the happy cause<br />
	Of Hamlet&#39;s wildness: so shall I hope your virtues<br />
	Will bring him to his wonted way again,<br />
	To both your honours.</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	Madam, I wish it may.</p>
<p>
	(Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE)</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,<br />
	We will bestow ourselves.</p>
<p>
	(To OPHELIA)</p>
<p>
	Read on this book;<br />
	That show of such an exercise may colour<br />
	Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,&mdash;<br />
	&#39;Tis too much proved&mdash;that with devotion&#39;s visage<br />
	And pious action we do sugar o&#39;er<br />
	The devil himself.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	[Aside] O, &#39;tis too true!<br />
	How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!<br />
	The harlot&#39;s cheek, beautied with plastering art,<br />
	Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it<br />
	Than is my deed to my most painted word:<br />
	O heavy burthen!</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	I hear him coming: let&#39;s withdraw, my lord.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS)</p>
<p>
	(Enter HAMLET)</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	To be, or not to be: that is the question:<br />
	Whether &#39;tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br />
	The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br />
	Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br />
	And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;<br />
	No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br />
	The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br />
	That flesh is heir to, &#39;tis a consummation<br />
	Devoutly to be wish&#39;d. To die, to sleep;<br />
	To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there&#39;s the rub;<br />
	For in that sleep of death what dreams may come<br />
	When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br />
	Must give us pause: there&#39;s the respect<br />
	That makes calamity of so long life;<br />
	For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br />
	The oppressor&#39;s wrong, the proud man&#39;s contumely,<br />
	The pangs of despised love, the law&#39;s delay,<br />
	The insolence of office and the spurns<br />
	That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br />
	When he himself might his quietus make<br />
	With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,<br />
	To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br />
	But that the dread of something after death,<br />
	The undiscover&#39;d country from whose bourn<br />
	No traveller returns, puzzles the will<br />
	And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br />
	Than fly to others that we know not of?<br />
	Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;<br />
	And thus the native hue of resolution<br />
	Is sicklied o&#39;er with the pale cast of thought,<br />
	And enterprises of great pith and moment<br />
	With this regard their currents turn awry,<br />
	And lose the name of action.&mdash;Soft you now!<br />
	The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons<br />
	Be all my sins remember&#39;d.</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	Good my lord,<br />
	How does your honour for this many a day?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I humbly thank you; well, well, well.</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	My lord, I have remembrances of yours,<br />
	That I have longed long to re-deliver;<br />
	I pray you, now receive them.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	No, not I;<br />
	I never gave you aught.</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	My honour&#39;d lord, you know right well you did;<br />
	And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed<br />
	As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,<br />
	Take these again; for to the noble mind<br />
	Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.<br />
	There, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Ha, ha! are you honest?</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	My lord?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Are you fair?</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	What means your lordship?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should<br />
	admit no discourse to your beauty.</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than<br />
	with honesty?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner<br />
	transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the<br />
	force of honesty can translate beauty into his<br />
	likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the<br />
	time gives it proof. I did love you once.</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot<br />
	so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of<br />
	it: I loved you not.</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	I was the more deceived.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a<br />
	breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;<br />
	but yet I could accuse me of such things that it<br />
	were better my mother had not borne me: I am very<br />
	proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at<br />
	my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,<br />
	imagination to give them shape, or time to act them<br />
	in. What should such fellows as I do crawling<br />
	between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,<br />
	all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.<br />
	Where&#39;s your father?</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	At home, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the<br />
	fool no where but in&#39;s own house. Farewell.</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	O, help him, you sweet heavens!</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	If thou dost marry, I&#39;ll give thee this plague for<br />
	thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as<br />
	snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a<br />
	nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs<br />
	marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough<br />
	what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,<br />
	and quickly too. Farewell.</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	O heavenly powers, restore him!</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God<br />
	has given you one face, and you make yourselves<br />
	another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and<br />
	nick-name God&#39;s creatures, and make your wantonness<br />
	your ignorance. Go to, I&#39;ll no more on&#39;t; it hath<br />
	made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:<br />
	those that are married already, all but one, shall<br />
	live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a<br />
	nunnery, go.</p>
<p>
	(Exit)</p>
<p>
	OPHELIA<br />
	O, what a noble mind is here o&#39;erthrown!<br />
	The courtier&#39;s, soldier&#39;s, scholar&#39;s, eye, tongue, sword;<br />
	The expectancy and rose of the fair state,<br />
	The glass of fashion and the mould of form,<br />
	The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!<br />
	And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,<br />
	That suck&#39;d the honey of his music vows,<br />
	Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,<br />
	Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;<br />
	That unmatch&#39;d form and feature of blown youth<br />
	Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,<br />
	To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!</p>
<p>
	(Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS)</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Love! his affections do not that way tend;<br />
	Nor what he spake, though it lack&#39;d form a little,<br />
	Was not like madness. There&#39;s something in his soul,<br />
	O&#39;er which his melancholy sits on brood;<br />
	And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose<br />
	Will be some danger: which for to prevent,<br />
	I have in quick determination<br />
	Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,<br />
	For the demand of our neglected tribute<br />
	Haply the seas and countries different<br />
	With variable objects shall expel<br />
	This something-settled matter in his heart,<br />
	Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus<br />
	From fashion of himself. What think you on&#39;t?</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	It shall do well: but yet do I believe<br />
	The origin and commencement of his grief<br />
	Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!<br />
	You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;<br />
	We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;<br />
	But, if you hold it fit, after the play<br />
	Let his queen mother all alone entreat him<br />
	To show his grief: let her be round with him;<br />
	And I&#39;ll be placed, so please you, in the ear<br />
	Of all their conference. If she find him not,<br />
	To England send him, or confine him where<br />
	Your wisdom best shall think.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	It shall be so:<br />
	Madness in great ones must not unwatch&#39;d go.</p>
