	SCENE II. A room in the castle.</p>
<p>
	(Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants)</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!<br />
	Moreover that we much did long to see you,<br />
	The need we have to use you did provoke<br />
	Our hasty sending. Something have you heard<br />
	Of Hamlet&#39;s transformation; so call it,<br />
	Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man<br />
	Resembles that it was. What it should be,<br />
	More than his father&#39;s death, that thus hath put him<br />
	So much from the understanding of himself,<br />
	I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,<br />
	That, being of so young days brought up with him,<br />
	And sith so neighbour&#39;d to his youth and havior,<br />
	That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court<br />
	Some little time: so by your companies<br />
	To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,<br />
	So much as from occasion you may glean,<br />
	Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,<br />
	That, open&#39;d, lies within our remedy.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Good gentlemen, he hath much talk&#39;d of you;<br />
	And sure I am two men there are not living<br />
	To whom he more adheres. If it will please you<br />
	To show us so much gentry and good will<br />
	As to expend your time with us awhile,<br />
	For the supply and profit of our hope,<br />
	Your visitation shall receive such thanks<br />
	As fits a king&#39;s remembrance.</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	Both your majesties<br />
	Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,<br />
	Put your dread pleasures more into command<br />
	Than to entreaty.</p>
<p>
	GUILDENSTERN<br />
	But we both obey,<br />
	And here give up ourselves, in the full bent<br />
	To lay our service freely at your feet,<br />
	To be commanded.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:<br />
	And I beseech you instantly to visit<br />
	My too much changed son. Go, some of you,<br />
	And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.</p>
<p>
	GUILDENSTERN<br />
	Heavens make our presence and our practises<br />
	Pleasant and helpful to him!</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Ay, amen!</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some Attendants)</p>
<p>
	(Enter POLONIUS)</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,<br />
	Are joyfully return&#39;d.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Thou still hast been the father of good news.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,<br />
	I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,<br />
	Both to my God and to my gracious king:<br />
	And I do think, or else this brain of mine<br />
	Hunts not the trail of policy so sure<br />
	As it hath used to do, that I have found<br />
	The very cause of Hamlet&#39;s lunacy.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Give first admittance to the ambassadors;<br />
	My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.</p>
<p>
	(Exit POLONIUS)</p>
<p>
	He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found<br />
	The head and source of all your son&#39;s distemper.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	I doubt it is no other but the main;<br />
	His father&#39;s death, and our o&#39;erhasty marriage.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Well, we shall sift him.</p>
<p>
	(Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS)</p>
<p>
	Welcome, my good friends!<br />
	Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?</p>
<p>
	VOLTIMAND<br />
	Most fair return of greetings and desires.<br />
	Upon our first, he sent out to suppress<br />
	His nephew&#39;s levies; which to him appear&#39;d<br />
	To be a preparation &#39;gainst the Polack;<br />
	But, better look&#39;d into, he truly found<br />
	It was against your highness: whereat grieved,<br />
	That so his sickness, age and impotence<br />
	Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests<br />
	On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;<br />
	Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine<br />
	Makes vow before his uncle never more<br />
	To give the assay of arms against your majesty.<br />
	Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,<br />
	Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,<br />
	And his commission to employ those soldiers,<br />
	So levied as before, against the Polack:<br />
	With an entreaty, herein further shown,</p>
<p>
	(Giving a paper)</p>
<p>
	That it might please you to give quiet pass<br />
	Through your dominions for this enterprise,<br />
	On such regards of safety and allowance<br />
	As therein are set down.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	It likes us well;<br />
	And at our more consider&#39;d time well read,<br />
	Answer, and think upon this business.<br />
	Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:<br />
	Go to your rest; at night we&#39;ll feast together:<br />
	Most welcome home!</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS)</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	This business is well ended.<br />
	My liege, and madam, to expostulate<br />
	What majesty should be, what duty is,<br />
	Why day is day, night night, and time is time,<br />
	Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.<br />
	Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,<br />
	And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,<br />
	I will be brief: your noble son is mad:<br />
	Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,<br />
	What is&#39;t but to be nothing else but mad?<br />
	But let that go.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	More matter, with less art.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Madam, I swear I use no art at all.<br />
	That he is mad, &#39;tis true: &#39;tis true &#39;tis pity;<br />
	And pity &#39;tis &#39;tis true: a foolish figure;<br />
	But farewell it, for I will use no art.<br />
	Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains<br />
	That we find out the cause of this effect,<br />
	Or rather say, the cause of this defect,<br />
	For this effect defective comes by cause:<br />
	Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.<br />
	I have a daughter&mdash;have while she is mine&mdash;<br />
	Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,<br />
	Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.</p>
<p>
	(Reads)</p>
<p>
	&#39;To the celestial and my soul&#39;s idol, the most<br />
	beautified Ophelia,&#39;&mdash;<br />
	That&#39;s an ill phrase, a vile phrase; &#39;beautified&#39; is<br />
	a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:</p>
<p>
	(Reads)</p>
<p>
	&#39;In her excellent white bosom, these, &amp; c.&#39;</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Came this from Hamlet to her?</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.</p>
<p>
	(Reads)</p>
<p>
	&#39;Doubt thou the stars are fire;<br />
	Doubt that the sun doth move;<br />
	Doubt truth to be a liar;<br />
	But never doubt I love.<br />
	&#39;O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;<br />
	I have not art to reckon my groans: but that<br />
	I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.<br />
	&#39;Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst<br />
	this machine is to him, HAMLET.&#39;<br />
	This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,<br />
	And more above, hath his solicitings,<br />
	As they fell out by time, by means and place,<br />
	All given to mine ear.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	But how hath she<br />
	Received his love?</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	What do you think of me?</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	As of a man faithful and honourable.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	I would fain prove so. But what might you think,<br />
	When I had seen this hot love on the wing&mdash;<br />
	As I perceived it, I must tell you that,<br />
	Before my daughter told me&mdash;what might you,<br />
	Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,<br />
	If I had play&#39;d the desk or table-book,<br />
	Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,<br />
	Or look&#39;d upon this love with idle sight;<br />
	What might you think? No, I went round to work,<br />
	And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:<br />
	&#39;Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;<br />
	This must not be:&#39; and then I precepts gave her,<br />
	That she should lock herself from his resort,<br />
	Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.<br />
	Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;<br />
	And he, repulsed&mdash;a short tale to make&mdash;<br />
	Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,<br />
	Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,<br />
	Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,<br />
	Into the madness wherein now he raves,<br />
	And all we mourn for.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Do you think &#39;tis this?</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	It may be, very likely.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Hath there been such a time&mdash;I&#39;d fain know that&mdash;<br />
	That I have positively said &#39;Tis so,&#39;<br />
	When it proved otherwise?</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Not that I know.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	[Pointing to his head and shoulder]<br />
	Take this from this, if this be otherwise:<br />
	If circumstances lead me, I will find<br />
	Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed<br />
	Within the centre.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	How may we try it further?</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	You know, sometimes he walks four hours together<br />
	Here in the lobby.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	So he does indeed.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	At such a time I&#39;ll loose my daughter to him:<br />
	Be you and I behind an arras then;<br />
	Mark the encounter: if he love her not<br />
	And be not from his reason fall&#39;n thereon,<br />
	Let me be no assistant for a state,<br />
	But keep a farm and carters.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	We will try it.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Away, I do beseech you, both away:<br />
	I&#39;ll board him presently.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and Attendants)</p>

	(Enter HAMLET, reading)</p>
<p>
	O, give me leave:<br />
	How does my good Lord Hamlet?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Well, God-a-mercy.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Do you know me, my lord?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Not I, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Then I would you were so honest a man.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Honest, my lord!</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be<br />
	one man picked out of ten thousand.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	That&#39;s very true, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a<br />
	god kissing carrion,&mdash;Have you a daughter?</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	I have, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Let her not walk i&#39; the sun: conception is a<br />
	blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.<br />
	Friend, look to &#39;t.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	[Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my<br />
	daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I<br />
	was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and<br />
	truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for<br />
	love; very near this. I&#39;ll speak to him again.<br />
	What do you read, my lord?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Words, words, words.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	What is the matter, my lord?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Between who?</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here<br />
	that old men have grey beards, that their faces are<br />
	wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and<br />
	plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of<br />
	wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,<br />
	though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet<br />
	I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for<br />
	yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab<br />
	you could go backward.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	[Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is method<br />
	in &#39;t. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Into my grave.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Indeed, that is out o&#39; the air.</p>
<p>
	[Aside] How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness<br />
	that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity<br />
	could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will<br />
	leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of<br />
	meeting between him and my daughter.&mdash;My honourable<br />
	lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will<br />
	more willingly part withal: except my life, except<br />
	my life, except my life.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Fare you well, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	These tedious old fools!</p>
<p>
	(Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN)</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	[To POLONIUS] God save you, sir!</p>
<p>
	(Exit POLONIUS)</p>
<p>
	GUILDENSTERN<br />
	My honoured lord!</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	My most dear lord!</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	My excellent good friends! How dost thou,<br />
	Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	As the indifferent children of the earth.</p>
<p>
	GUILDENSTERN<br />
	Happy, in that we are not over-happy;<br />
	On fortune&#39;s cap we are not the very button.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Nor the soles of her shoe?</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	Neither, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of<br />
	her favours?</p>
<p>
	GUILDENSTERN<br />
	&#39;Faith, her privates we.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she<br />
	is a strumpet. What&#39;s the news?</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	None, my lord, but that the world&#39;s grown honest.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.<br />
	Let me question more in particular: what have you,<br />
	my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,<br />
	that she sends you to prison hither?</p>
<p>
	GUILDENSTERN<br />
	Prison, my lord!</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Denmark&#39;s a prison.</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	Then is the world one.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	A goodly one; in which there are many confines,<br />
	wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o&#39; the worst.</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	We think not so, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Why, then, &#39;tis none to you; for there is nothing<br />
	either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me<br />
	it is a prison.</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	Why then, your ambition makes it one; &#39;tis too<br />
	narrow for your mind.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count<br />
	myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I<br />
	have bad dreams.</p>
<p>
	GUILDENSTERN<br />
	Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very<br />
	substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	A dream itself is but a shadow.</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a<br />
	quality that it is but a shadow&#39;s shadow.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and<br />
	outstretched heroes the beggars&#39; shadows. Shall we<br />
	to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN<br />
	We&#39;ll wait upon you.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest<br />
	of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest<br />
	man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the<br />
	beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I<br />
	thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are<br />
	too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it<br />
	your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,<br />
	deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.</p>
<p>
	GUILDENSTERN<br />
	What should we say, my lord?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent<br />
	for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks<br />
	which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:<br />
	I know the good king and queen have sent for you.</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	To what end, my lord?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by<br />
	the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of<br />
	our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved<br />
	love, and by what more dear a better proposer could<br />
	charge you withal, be even and direct with me,<br />
	whether you were sent for, or no?</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	[Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	[Aside] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.&mdash;If you<br />
	love me, hold not off.</p>
<p>
	GUILDENSTERN<br />
	My lord, we were sent for.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation<br />
	prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king<br />
	and queen moult no feather. I have of late&mdash;but<br />
	wherefore I know not&mdash;lost all my mirth, forgone all<br />
	custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily<br />
	with my disposition that this goodly frame, the<br />
	earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most<br />
	excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave<br />
	o&#39;erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted<br />
	with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to<br />
	me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.<br />
	What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!<br />
	how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how<br />
	express and admirable! in action how like an angel!<br />
	in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the<br />
	world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,<br />
	what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not<br />
	me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling<br />
	you seem to say so.</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Why did you laugh then, when I said &#39;man delights not me&#39;?</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what<br />
	lenten entertainment the players shall receive from<br />
	you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they<br />
	coming, to offer you service.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty<br />
	shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight<br />
	shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not<br />
	sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part<br />
	in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose<br />
	lungs are tickled o&#39; the sere; and the lady shall<br />
	say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt<br />
	for&#39;t. What players are they?</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	Even those you were wont to take delight in, the<br />
	tragedians of the city.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	How chances it they travel? their residence, both<br />
	in reputation and profit, was better both ways.</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	I think their inhibition comes by the means of the<br />
	late innovation.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was<br />
	in the city? are they so followed?</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	No, indeed, are they not.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	How comes it? do they grow rusty?</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but<br />
	there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,<br />
	that cry out on the top of question, and are most<br />
	tyrannically clapped for&#39;t: these are now the<br />
	fashion, and so berattle the common stages&mdash;so they<br />
	call them&mdash;that many wearing rapiers are afraid of<br />
	goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	What, are they children? who maintains &#39;em? how are<br />
	they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no<br />
	longer than they can sing? will they not say<br />
	afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common<br />
	players&mdash;as it is most like, if their means are no<br />
	better&mdash;their writers do them wrong, to make them<br />
	exclaim against their own succession?</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	&#39;Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and<br />
	the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to<br />
	controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid<br />
	for argument, unless the poet and the player went to<br />
	cuffs in the question.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Is&#39;t possible?</p>
<p>
	GUILDENSTERN<br />
	O, there has been much throwing about of brains.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Do the boys carry it away?</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of<br />
	Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while<br />
	my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an<br />
	hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.<br />
	&#39;Sblood, there is something in this more than<br />
	natural, if philosophy could find it out.</p>
<p>
	(Flourish of trumpets within)</p>
<p>
	GUILDENSTERN<br />
	There are the players.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,<br />
	come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion<br />
	and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,<br />
	lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,<br />
	must show fairly outward, should more appear like<br />
	entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my<br />
	uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.</p>
<p>
	GUILDENSTERN<br />
	In what, my dear lord?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is<br />
	southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.</p>
<p>
	(Enter POLONIUS)</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Well be with you, gentlemen!</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a<br />
	hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet<br />
	out of his swaddling-clouts.</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	Happily he&#39;s the second time come to them; for they<br />
	say an old man is twice a child.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;<br />
	mark it. You say right, sir: o&#39; Monday morning;<br />
	&#39;twas so indeed.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	My lord, I have news to tell you.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	My lord, I have news to tell you.<br />
	When Roscius was an actor in Rome,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	The actors are come hither, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Buz, buz!<br />
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Upon mine honour,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Then came each actor on his ass,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,<br />
	comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,<br />
	historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-<br />
	comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or<br />
	poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor<br />
	Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the<br />
	liberty, these are the only men.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	What a treasure had he, my lord?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Why,<br />
	&#39;One fair daughter and no more,<br />
	The which he loved passing well.&#39;</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	[Aside] Still on my daughter.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Am I not i&#39; the right, old Jephthah?</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter<br />
	that I love passing well.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Nay, that follows not.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	What follows, then, my lord?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Why,<br />
	&#39;As by lot, God wot,&#39;<br />
	and then, you know,<br />
	&#39;It came to pass, as most like it was,&#39;&mdash;<br />
	the first row of the pious chanson will show you<br />
	more; for look, where my abridgement comes.</p>
<p>
	(Enter four or five Players)</p>
<p>
	You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad<br />
	to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old<br />
	friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:<br />
	comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young<br />
	lady and mistress! By&#39;r lady, your ladyship is<br />
	nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the<br />
	altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like<br />
	apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the<br />
	ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We&#39;ll e&#39;en<br />
	to&#39;t like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:<br />
	we&#39;ll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste<br />
	of your quality; come, a passionate speech.</p>
<p>
	First Player<br />
	What speech, my lord?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was<br />
	never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the<br />
	play, I remember, pleased not the million; &#39;twas<br />
	caviare to the general: but it was&mdash;as I received<br />
	it, and others, whose judgments in such matters<br />
	cried in the top of mine&mdash;an excellent play, well<br />
	digested in the scenes, set down with as much<br />
	modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there<br />
	were no sallets in the lines to make the matter<br />
	savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might<br />
	indict the author of affectation; but called it an<br />
	honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very<br />
	much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I<br />
	chiefly loved: &#39;twas Aeneas&#39; tale to Dido; and<br />
	thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of<br />
	Priam&#39;s slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin<br />
	at this line: let me see, let me see&mdash;<br />
	&#39;The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,&#39;&mdash;<br />
	it is not so:&mdash;it begins with Pyrrhus:&mdash;<br />
	&#39;The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,<br />
	Black as his purpose, did the night resemble<br />
	When he lay couched in the ominous horse,<br />
	Hath now this dread and black complexion smear&#39;d<br />
	With heraldry more dismal; head to foot<br />
	Now is he total gules; horridly trick&#39;d<br />
	With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,<br />
	Baked and impasted with the parching streets,<br />
	That lend a tyrannous and damned light<br />
	To their lord&#39;s murder: roasted in wrath and fire,<br />
	And thus o&#39;er-sized with coagulate gore,<br />
	With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus<br />
	Old grandsire Priam seeks.&#39;<br />
	So, proceed you.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	&#39;Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and<br />
	good discretion.</p>
<p>
	First Player<br />
	&#39;Anon he finds him<br />
	Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,<br />
	Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,<br />
	Repugnant to command: unequal match&#39;d,<br />
	Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;<br />
	But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword<br />
	The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,<br />
	Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top<br />
	Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash<br />
	Takes prisoner Pyrrhus&#39; ear: for, lo! his sword,<br />
	Which was declining on the milky head<br />
	Of reverend Priam, seem&#39;d i&#39; the air to stick:<br />
	So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,<br />
	And like a neutral to his will and matter,<br />
	Did nothing.<br />
	But, as we often see, against some storm,<br />
	A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,<br />
	The bold winds speechless and the orb below<br />
	As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder<br />
	Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus&#39; pause,<br />
	Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;<br />
	And never did the Cyclops&#39; hammers fall<br />
	On Mars&#39;s armour forged for proof eterne<br />
	With less remorse than Pyrrhus&#39; bleeding sword<br />
	Now falls on Priam.<br />
	Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,<br />
	In general synod &#39;take away her power;<br />
	Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,<br />
	And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,<br />
	As low as to the fiends!&#39;</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	This is too long.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	It shall to the barber&#39;s, with your beard. Prithee,<br />
	say on: he&#39;s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he<br />
	sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.</p>
<p>
	First Player<br />
	&#39;But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen&mdash;&#39;</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	&#39;The mobled queen?&#39;</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	That&#39;s good; &#39;mobled queen&#39; is good.</p>
<p>
	First Player<br />
	&#39;Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames<br />
	With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head<br />
	Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,<br />
	About her lank and all o&#39;er-teemed loins,<br />
	A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;<br />
	Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep&#39;d,<br />
	&#39;Gainst Fortune&#39;s state would treason have pronounced:<br />
	But if the gods themselves did see her then<br />
	When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport<br />
	In mincing with his sword her husband&#39;s limbs,<br />
	The instant burst of clamour that she made,<br />
	Unless things mortal move them not at all,<br />
	Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,<br />
	And passion in the gods.&#39;</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has<br />
	tears in&#39;s eyes. Pray you, no more.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	&#39;Tis well: I&#39;ll have thee speak out the rest soon.<br />
	Good my lord, will you see the players well<br />
	bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for<br />
	they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the<br />
	time: after your death you were better have a bad<br />
	epitaph than their ill report while you live.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	My lord, I will use them according to their desert.</p>

	HAMLET<br />
	God&#39;s bodykins, man, much better: use every man<br />
	after his desert, and who should &#39;scape whipping?<br />
	Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less<br />
	they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.<br />
	Take them in.</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	Come, sirs.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Follow him, friends: we&#39;ll hear a play to-morrow.</p>
<p>
	(Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First)</p>
<p>
	Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the<br />
	Murder of Gonzago?</p>
<p>
	First Player<br />
	Ay, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	We&#39;ll ha&#39;t to-morrow night. You could, for a need,<br />
	study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which<br />
	I would set down and insert in&#39;t, could you not?</p>
<p>
	First Player<br />
	Ay, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him not.</p>
<p>
	(Exit First Player)</p>
<p>
	My good friends, I&#39;ll leave you till night: you are<br />
	welcome to Elsinore.</p>
<p>
	ROSENCRANTZ<br />
	Good my lord!</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Ay, so, God be wi&#39; ye;</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN)</p>
<p>
	Now I am alone.<br />
	O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!<br />
	Is it not monstrous that this player here,<br />
	But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,<br />
	Could force his soul so to his own conceit<br />
	That from her working all his visage wann&#39;d,<br />
	Tears in his eyes, distraction in&#39;s aspect,<br />
	A broken voice, and his whole function suiting<br />
	With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!<br />
	For Hecuba!<br />
	What&#39;s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,<br />
	That he should weep for her? What would he do,<br />
	Had he the motive and the cue for passion<br />
	That I have? He would drown the stage with tears<br />
	And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,<br />
	Make mad the guilty and appal the free,<br />
	Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed<br />
	The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,<br />
	A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,<br />
	Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,<br />
	And can say nothing; no, not for a king,<br />
	Upon whose property and most dear life<br />
	A damn&#39;d defeat was made. Am I a coward?<br />
	Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?<br />
	Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?<br />
	Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i&#39; the throat,<br />
	As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?<br />
	Ha!<br />
	&#39;Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be<br />
	But I am pigeon-liver&#39;d and lack gall<br />
	To make oppression bitter, or ere this<br />
	I should have fatted all the region kites<br />
	With this slave&#39;s offal: bloody, bawdy villain!<br />
	Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!<br />
	O, vengeance!<br />
	Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,<br />
	That I, the son of a dear father murder&#39;d,<br />
	Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,<br />
	Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,<br />
	And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,<br />
	A scullion!<br />
	Fie upon&#39;t! foh! About, my brain! I have heard<br />
	That guilty creatures sitting at a play<br />
	Have by the very cunning of the scene<br />
	Been struck so to the soul that presently<br />
	They have proclaim&#39;d their malefactions;<br />
	For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak<br />
	With most miraculous organ. I&#39;ll have these players<br />
	Play something like the murder of my father<br />
	Before mine uncle: I&#39;ll observe his looks;<br />
	I&#39;ll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,<br />
	I know my course. The spirit that I have seen<br />
	May be the devil: and the devil hath power<br />
	To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps<br />
	Out of my weakness and my melancholy,<br />
	As he is very potent with such spirits,<br />
	Abuses me to damn me: I&#39;ll have grounds<br />
	More relative than this: the play &#39;s the thing<br />
	Wherein I&#39;ll catch the conscience of the king.</p>
