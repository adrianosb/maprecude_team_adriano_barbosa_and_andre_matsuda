	SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.</p>
<p>
	(Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants)</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother&#39;s death<br />
	The memory be green, and that it us befitted<br />
	To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom<br />
	To be contracted in one brow of woe,<br />
	Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature<br />
	That we with wisest sorrow think on him,<br />
	Together with remembrance of ourselves.<br />
	Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,<br />
	The imperial jointress to this warlike state,<br />
	Have we, as &#39;twere with a defeated joy,&mdash;<br />
	With an auspicious and a dropping eye,<br />
	With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,<br />
	In equal scale weighing delight and dole,&mdash;<br />
	Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr&#39;d<br />
	Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone<br />
	With this affair along. For all, our thanks.<br />
	Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,<br />
	Holding a weak supposal of our worth,<br />
	Or thinking by our late dear brother&#39;s death<br />
	Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,<br />
	Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,<br />
	He hath not fail&#39;d to pester us with message,<br />
	Importing the surrender of those lands<br />
	Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,<br />
	To our most valiant brother. So much for him.<br />
	Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:<br />
	Thus much the business is: we have here writ<br />
	To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,&mdash;<br />
	Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears<br />
	Of this his nephew&#39;s purpose,&mdash;to suppress<br />
	His further gait herein; in that the levies,<br />
	The lists and full proportions, are all made<br />
	Out of his subject: and we here dispatch<br />
	You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,<br />
	For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;<br />
	Giving to you no further personal power<br />
	To business with the king, more than the scope<br />
	Of these delated articles allow.<br />
	Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.</p>
<p>
	CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND<br />
	In that and all things will we show our duty.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS)</p>
<p>
	And now, Laertes, what&#39;s the news with you?<br />
	You told us of some suit; what is&#39;t, Laertes?<br />
	You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,<br />
	And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,<br />
	That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?<br />
	The head is not more native to the heart,<br />
	The hand more instrumental to the mouth,<br />
	Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.<br />
	What wouldst thou have, Laertes?</p>
<p>
	LAERTES<br />
	My dread lord,<br />
	Your leave and favour to return to France;<br />
	From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,<br />
	To show my duty in your coronation,<br />
	Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,<br />
	My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France<br />
	And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Have you your father&#39;s leave? What says Polonius?</p>
<p>
	LORD POLONIUS<br />
	He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave<br />
	By laboursome petition, and at last<br />
	Upon his will I seal&#39;d my hard consent:<br />
	I do beseech you, give him leave to go.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,<br />
	And thy best graces spend it at thy will!<br />
	But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	[Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	How is it that the clouds still hang on you?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Not so, my lord; I am too much i&#39; the sun.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,<br />
	And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.<br />
	Do not for ever with thy vailed lids<br />
	Seek for thy noble father in the dust:<br />
	Thou know&#39;st &#39;tis common; all that lives must die,<br />
	Passing through nature to eternity.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Ay, madam, it is common.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	If it be,<br />
	Why seems it so particular with thee?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not &#39;seems.&#39;<br />
	&#39;Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,<br />
	Nor customary suits of solemn black,<br />
	Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,<br />
	No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,<br />
	Nor the dejected &#39;havior of the visage,<br />
	Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,<br />
	That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,<br />
	For they are actions that a man might play:<br />
	But I have that within which passeth show;<br />
	These but the trappings and the suits of woe.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	&#39;Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,<br />
	To give these mourning duties to your father:<br />
	But, you must know, your father lost a father;<br />
	That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound<br />
	In filial obligation for some term<br />
	To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever<br />
	In obstinate condolement is a course<br />
	Of impious stubbornness; &#39;tis unmanly grief;<br />
	It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,<br />
	A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,<br />
	An understanding simple and unschool&#39;d:<br />
	For what we know must be and is as common<br />
	As any the most vulgar thing to sense,<br />
	Why should we in our peevish opposition<br />
	Take it to heart? Fie! &#39;tis a fault to heaven,<br />
	A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,<br />
	To reason most absurd: whose common theme<br />
	Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,<br />
	From the first corse till he that died to-day,<br />
	&#39;This must be so.&#39; We pray you, throw to earth<br />
	This unprevailing woe, and think of us<br />
	As of a father: for let the world take note,<br />
	You are the most immediate to our throne;<br />
	And with no less nobility of love<br />
	Than that which dearest father bears his son,<br />
	Do I impart toward you. For your intent<br />
	In going back to school in Wittenberg,<br />
	It is most retrograde to our desire:<br />
	And we beseech you, bend you to remain<br />
	Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,<br />
	Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.</p>
<p>
	QUEEN GERTRUDE<br />
	Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:<br />
	I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I shall in all my best obey you, madam.</p>
<p>
	KING CLAUDIUS<br />
	Why, &#39;tis a loving and a fair reply:<br />
	Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;<br />
	This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet<br />
	Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,<br />
	No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,<br />
	But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,<br />
	And the king&#39;s rouse the heavens all bruit again,<br />
	Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt all but HAMLET)</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	O, that this too too solid flesh would melt<br />
	Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!<br />
	Or that the Everlasting had not fix&#39;d<br />
	His canon &#39;gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!<br />
	How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,<br />
	Seem to me all the uses of this world!<br />
	Fie on&#39;t! ah fie! &#39;tis an unweeded garden,<br />
	That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature<br />
	Possess it merely. That it should come to this!<br />
	But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:<br />
	So excellent a king; that was, to this,<br />
	Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother<br />
	That he might not beteem the winds of heaven<br />
	Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!<br />
	Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,<br />
	As if increase of appetite had grown<br />
	By what it fed on: and yet, within a month&mdash;<br />
	Let me not think on&#39;t&mdash;Frailty, thy name is woman!&mdash;<br />
	A little month, or ere those shoes were old<br />
	With which she follow&#39;d my poor father&#39;s body,<br />
	Like Niobe, all tears:&mdash;why she, even she&mdash;<br />
	O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,<br />
	Would have mourn&#39;d longer&mdash;married with my uncle,<br />
	My father&#39;s brother, but no more like my father<br />
	Than I to Hercules: within a month:<br />
	Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears<br />
	Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,<br />
	She married. O, most wicked speed, to post<br />
	With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!<br />
	It is not nor it cannot come to good:<br />
	But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.</p>
<p>
	(Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO)</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Hail to your lordship!</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I am glad to see you well:<br />
	Horatio,&mdash;or I do forget myself.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Sir, my good friend; I&#39;ll change that name with you:<br />
	And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	My good lord&mdash;</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.<br />
	But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	A truant disposition, good my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I would not hear your enemy say so,<br />
	Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,<br />
	To make it truster of your own report<br />
	Against yourself: I know you are no truant.<br />
	But what is your affair in Elsinore?<br />
	We&#39;ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	My lord, I came to see your father&#39;s funeral.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;<br />
	I think it was to see my mother&#39;s wedding.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Indeed, my lord, it follow&#39;d hard upon.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats<br />
	Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.<br />
	Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven<br />
	Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!<br />
	My father!&mdash;methinks I see my father.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Where, my lord?</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	In my mind&#39;s eye, Horatio.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	I saw him once; he was a goodly king.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	He was a man, take him for all in all,<br />
	I shall not look upon his like again.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Saw? who?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	My lord, the king your father.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	The king my father!</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Season your admiration for awhile<br />
	With an attent ear, till I may deliver,<br />
	Upon the witness of these gentlemen,<br />
	This marvel to you.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	For God&#39;s love, let me hear.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Two nights together had these gentlemen,<br />
	Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,<br />
	In the dead vast and middle of the night,<br />
	Been thus encounter&#39;d. A figure like your father,<br />
	Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,<br />
	Appears before them, and with solemn march<br />
	Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk&#39;d<br />
	By their oppress&#39;d and fear-surprised eyes,<br />
	Within his truncheon&#39;s length; whilst they, distilled<br />
	Almost to jelly with the act of fear,<br />
	Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me<br />
	In dreadful secrecy impart they did;<br />
	And I with them the third night kept the watch;<br />
	Where, as they had deliver&#39;d, both in time,<br />
	Form of the thing, each word made true and good,<br />
	The apparition comes: I knew your father;<br />
	These hands are not more like.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	But where was this?</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	My lord, upon the platform where we watch&#39;d.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Did you not speak to it?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	My lord, I did;<br />
	But answer made it none: yet once methought<br />
	It lifted up its head and did address<br />
	Itself to motion, like as it would speak;<br />
	But even then the morning cock crew loud,<br />
	And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,<br />
	And vanish&#39;d from our sight.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	&#39;Tis very strange.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	As I do live, my honour&#39;d lord, &#39;tis true;<br />
	And we did think it writ down in our duty<br />
	To let you know of it.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.<br />
	Hold you the watch to-night?</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS BERNARDO<br />
	We do, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Arm&#39;d, say you?</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS BERNARDO<br />
	Arm&#39;d, my lord.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	From top to toe?</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS BERNARDO<br />
	My lord, from head to foot.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Then saw you not his face?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	What, look&#39;d he frowningly?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Pale or red?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Nay, very pale.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	And fix&#39;d his eyes upon you?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Most constantly.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I would I had been there.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	It would have much amazed you.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Very like, very like. Stay&#39;d it long?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS BERNARDO<br />
	Longer, longer.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Not when I saw&#39;t.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	His beard was grizzled&mdash;no?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	It was, as I have seen it in his life,<br />
	A sable silver&#39;d.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	I will watch to-night;<br />
	Perchance &#39;twill walk again.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	I warrant it will.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	If it assume my noble father&#39;s person,<br />
	I&#39;ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape<br />
	And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,<br />
	If you have hitherto conceal&#39;d this sight,<br />
	Let it be tenable in your silence still;<br />
	And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,<br />
	Give it an understanding, but no tongue:<br />
	I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:<br />
	Upon the platform, &#39;twixt eleven and twelve,<br />
	I&#39;ll visit you.<br />
	All<br />
	Our duty to your honour.</p>
<p>
	HAMLET<br />
	Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt all but HAMLET)</p>
<p>
	My father&#39;s spirit in arms! all is not well;<br />
	I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!<br />
	Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,<br />
	Though all the earth o&#39;erwhelm them, to men&#39;s eyes.</p>
<p>
	(Exit)</p>
