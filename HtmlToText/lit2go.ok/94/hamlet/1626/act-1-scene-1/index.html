	ACT I</p>
<p>
	SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.</p>
<p>
	(FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO)</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	Who&#39;s there?</p>
<p>
	FRANCISCO<br />
	Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	Long live the king!</p>
<p>
	FRANCISCO<br />
	Bernardo?</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	He.</p>
<p>
	FRANCISCO<br />
	You come most carefully upon your hour.</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	&#39;Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.</p>
<p>
	FRANCISCO<br />
	For this relief much thanks: &#39;tis bitter cold,<br />
	And I am sick at heart.</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	Have you had quiet guard?</p>
<p>
	FRANCISCO<br />
	Not a mouse stirring.</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	Well, good night.<br />
	If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,<br />
	The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.</p>
<p>
	FRANCISCO<br />
	I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who&#39;s there?</p>
<p>
	(Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS)</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Friends to this ground.</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	And liegemen to the Dane.</p>
<p>
	FRANCISCO<br />
	Give you good night.</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	O, farewell, honest soldier:<br />
	Who hath relieved you?</p>
<p>
	FRANCISCO<br />
	Bernardo has my place.<br />
	Give you good night.</p>
<p>
	(Exit)</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	Holla! Bernardo!</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	Say,<br />
	What, is Horatio there?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	A piece of him.</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	What, has this thing appear&#39;d again to-night?</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	I have seen nothing.</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	Horatio says &#39;tis but our fantasy,<br />
	And will not let belief take hold of him<br />
	Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:<br />
	Therefore I have entreated him along<br />
	With us to watch the minutes of this night;<br />
	That if again this apparition come,<br />
	He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Tush, tush, &#39;twill not appear.</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	Sit down awhile;<br />
	And let us once again assail your ears,<br />
	That are so fortified against our story<br />
	What we have two nights seen.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Well, sit we down,<br />
	And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	Last night of all,<br />
	When yond same star that&#39;s westward from the pole<br />
	Had made his course to illume that part of heaven<br />
	Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,<br />
	The bell then beating one,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	(Enter Ghost)</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	In the same figure, like the king that&#39;s dead.</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	It would be spoke to.</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	Question it, Horatio.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	What art thou that usurp&#39;st this time of night,<br />
	Together with that fair and warlike form<br />
	In which the majesty of buried Denmark<br />
	Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	It is offended.</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	See, it stalks away!</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!</p>
<p>
	(Exit Ghost)</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	&#39;Tis gone, and will not answer.</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:<br />
	Is not this something more than fantasy?<br />
	What think you on&#39;t?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Before my God, I might not this believe<br />
	Without the sensible and true avouch<br />
	Of mine own eyes.</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	Is it not like the king?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	As thou art to thyself:<br />
	Such was the very armour he had on<br />
	When he the ambitious Norway combated;<br />
	So frown&#39;d he once, when, in an angry parle,<br />
	He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.<br />
	&#39;Tis strange.</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,<br />
	With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	In what particular thought to work I know not;<br />
	But in the gross and scope of my opinion,<br />
	This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,<br />
	Why this same strict and most observant watch<br />
	So nightly toils the subject of the land,<br />
	And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,<br />
	And foreign mart for implements of war;<br />
	Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task<br />
	Does not divide the Sunday from the week;<br />
	What might be toward, that this sweaty haste<br />
	Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:<br />
	Who is&#39;t that can inform me?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	That can I;<br />
	At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,<br />
	Whose image even but now appear&#39;d to us,<br />
	Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,<br />
	Thereto prick&#39;d on by a most emulate pride,<br />
	Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet&mdash;<br />
	For so this side of our known world esteem&#39;d him&mdash;<br />
	Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal&#39;d compact,<br />
	Well ratified by law and heraldry,<br />
	Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands<br />
	Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:<br />
	Against the which, a moiety competent<br />
	Was gaged by our king; which had return&#39;d<br />
	To the inheritance of Fortinbras,<br />
	Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,<br />
	And carriage of the article design&#39;d,<br />
	His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,<br />
	Of unimproved mettle hot and full,<br />
	Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there<br />
	Shark&#39;d up a list of lawless resolutes,<br />
	For food and diet, to some enterprise<br />
	That hath a stomach in&#39;t; which is no other&mdash;<br />
	As it doth well appear unto our state&mdash;<br />
	But to recover of us, by strong hand<br />
	And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands<br />
	So by his father lost: and this, I take it,<br />
	Is the main motive of our preparations,<br />
	The source of this our watch and the chief head<br />
	Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	I think it be no other but e&#39;en so:<br />
	Well may it sort that this portentous figure<br />
	Comes armed through our watch; so like the king<br />
	That was and is the question of these wars.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	A mote it is to trouble the mind&#39;s eye.<br />
	In the most high and palmy state of Rome,<br />
	A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,<br />
	The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead<br />
	Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:<br />
	As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,<br />
	Disasters in the sun; and the moist star<br />
	Upon whose influence Neptune&#39;s empire stands<br />
	Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:<br />
	And even the like precurse of fierce events,<br />
	As harbingers preceding still the fates<br />
	And prologue to the omen coming on,<br />
	Have heaven and earth together demonstrated<br />
	Unto our climatures and countrymen.&mdash;<br />
	But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!</p>
<p>
	(Re-enter Ghost)</p>
<p>
	I&#39;ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!<br />
	If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,<br />
	Speak to me:<br />
	If there be any good thing to be done,<br />
	That may to thee do ease and grace to me,<br />
	Speak to me:</p>
<p>
	(Cock crows)</p>
<p>
	If thou art privy to thy country&#39;s fate,<br />
	Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!<br />
	Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life<br />
	Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,<br />
	For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,<br />
	Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	Shall I strike at it with my partisan?</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	Do, if it will not stand.</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	&#39;Tis here!</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	&#39;Tis here!</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	&#39;Tis gone!</p>
<p>
	(Exit Ghost)</p>
<p>
	We do it wrong, being so majestical,<br />
	To offer it the show of violence;<br />
	For it is, as the air, invulnerable,<br />
	And our vain blows malicious mockery.</p>
<p>
	BERNARDO<br />
	It was about to speak, when the cock crew.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	And then it started like a guilty thing<br />
	Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,<br />
	The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,<br />
	Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat<br />
	Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,<br />
	Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,<br />
	The extravagant and erring spirit hies<br />
	To his confine: and of the truth herein<br />
	This present object made probation.</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	It faded on the crowing of the cock.<br />
	Some say that ever &#39;gainst that season comes<br />
	Wherein our Saviour&#39;s birth is celebrated,<br />
	The bird of dawning singeth all night long:<br />
	And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;<br />
	The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,<br />
	No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,<br />
	So hallow&#39;d and so gracious is the time.</p>
<p>
	HORATIO<br />
	So have I heard and do in part believe it.<br />
	But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,<br />
	Walks o&#39;er the dew of yon high eastward hill:<br />
	Break we our watch up; and by my advice,<br />
	Let us impart what we have seen to-night<br />
	Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,<br />
	This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.<br />
	Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,<br />
	As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</p>
<p>
	MARCELLUS<br />
	Let&#39;s do&#39;t, I pray; and I this morning know<br />
	Where we shall find him most conveniently.</p>
<p>
