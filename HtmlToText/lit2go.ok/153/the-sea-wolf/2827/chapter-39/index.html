                <p>
	The day came for our departure.&nbsp; There was no longer anything to detain us on Endeavour Island.&nbsp; The <em>Ghost&rsquo;s</em> stumpy masts were in place, her crazy sails bent.&nbsp; All my handiwork was strong, none of it beautiful; but I knew that it would work, and I felt myself a man of power as I looked at it.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I did it!&nbsp; I did it!&nbsp; With my own hands I did it!&rdquo; I wanted to cry aloud.</p>
<p>
	But Maud and I had a way of voicing each other&rsquo;s thoughts, and she said, as we prepared to hoist the mainsail:</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;To think, Humphrey, you did it all with your own hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But there were two other hands,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two small hands, and don&rsquo;t say that was a phrase, also, of your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She laughed and shook her head, and held her hands up for inspection.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I can never get them clean again,&rdquo; she wailed, &ldquo;nor soften the weather-beat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Then dirt and weather-beat shall be your guerdon of honour,&rdquo; I said, holding them in mine; and, spite of my resolutions, I would have kissed the two dear hands had she not swiftly withdrawn them.</p>
<p>
	Our comradeship was becoming tremulous, I had mastered my love long and well, but now it was mastering me.&nbsp; Wilfully had it disobeyed and won my eyes to speech, and now it was winning my tongue&mdash;ay, and my lips, for they were mad this moment to kiss the two small hands which had toiled so faithfully and hard.&nbsp; And I, too, was mad.&nbsp; There was a cry in my being like bugles calling me to her.&nbsp; And there was a wind blowing upon me which I could not resist, swaying the very body of me till I leaned toward her, all unconscious that I leaned.&nbsp; And she knew it.&nbsp; She could not but know it as she swiftly drew away her hands, and yet, could not forbear one quick searching look before she turned away her eyes.</p>
<p>
	By means of deck-tackles I had arranged to carry the halyards forward to the windlass; and now I hoisted the mainsail, peak and throat, at the same time.&nbsp; It was a clumsy way, but it did not take long, and soon the foresail as well was up and fluttering.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We can never get that anchor up in this narrow place, once it has left the bottom,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We should be on the rocks first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Slip it,&rdquo; was my answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;And when I do, you must do your first work on the windlass.&nbsp; I shall have to run at once to the wheel, and at the same time you must be hoisting the jib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	This man&oelig;uvre of getting under way I had studied and worked out a score of times; and, with the jib-halyard to the windlass, I knew Maud was capable of hoisting that most necessary sail.&nbsp; A brisk wind was blowing into the cove, and though the water was calm, rapid work was required to get us safely out.</p>
<p>
	When I knocked the shackle-bolt loose, the chain roared out through the hawse-hole and into the sea.&nbsp; I raced aft, putting the wheel up.&nbsp; The <em>Ghost </em>seemed to start into life as she heeled to the first fill of her sails.&nbsp; The jib was rising.&nbsp; As it filled, the <em>Ghost&rsquo;s</em> bow swung off and I had to put the wheel down a few spokes and steady her.</p>
<p>
	I had devised an automatic jib-sheet which passed the jib across of itself, so there was no need for Maud to attend to that; but she was still hoisting the jib when I put the wheel hard down.&nbsp; It was a moment of anxiety, for the <em>Ghost </em>was rushing directly upon the beach, a stone&rsquo;s throw distant.&nbsp; But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.&nbsp; There was a great fluttering and flapping of canvas and reef-points, most welcome to my ears, then she filled away on the other tack.</p>
<p>
	Maud had finished her task and come aft, where she stood beside me, a small cap perched on her wind-blown hair, her cheeks flushed from exertion, her eyes wide and bright with the excitement, her nostrils quivering to the rush and bite of the fresh salt air.&nbsp; Her brown eyes were like a startled deer&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There was a wild, keen look in them I had never seen before, and her lips parted and her breath suspended as the <em>Ghost,</em> charging upon the wall of rock at the entrance to the inner cove, swept into the wind and filled away into safe water.</p>
<p>
	My first mate&rsquo;s berth on the sealing grounds stood me in good stead, and I cleared the inner cove and laid a long tack along the shore of the outer cove.&nbsp; Once again about, and the <em>Ghost </em>headed out to open sea.&nbsp; She had now caught the bosom-breathing of the ocean, and was herself a-breath with the rhythm of it as she smoothly mounted and slipped down each broad-backed wave.&nbsp; The day had been dull and overcast, but the sun now burst through the clouds, a welcome omen, and shone upon the curving beach where together we had dared the lords of the harem and slain the holluschickie.&nbsp; All Endeavour Island brightened under the sun.&nbsp; Even the grim south-western promontory showed less grim, and here and there, where the sea-spray wet its surface, high lights flashed and dazzled in the sun.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I shall always think of it with pride,&rdquo; I said to Maud.</p>
<p>
	She threw her head back in a queenly way but said, &ldquo;Dear, dear Endeavour Island!&nbsp; I shall always love it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; I said quickly.</p>
<p>
	It seemed our eyes must meet in a great understanding, and yet, loath, they struggled away and did not meet.</p>
<p>
	There was a silence I might almost call awkward, till I broke it, saying:</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;See those black clouds to windward.&nbsp; You remember, I told you last night the barometer was falling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And the sun is gone,&rdquo; she said, her eyes still fixed upon our island, where we had proved our mastery over matter and attained to the truest comradeship that may fall to man and woman.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s slack off the sheets for Japan!&rdquo; I cried gaily.&nbsp; &ldquo;A fair wind and a flowing sheet, you know, or however it goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Lashing the wheel I ran forward, eased the fore and mainsheets, took in on the boom-tackles and trimmed everything for the quartering breeze which was ours.&nbsp; It was a fresh breeze, very fresh, but I resolved to run as long as I dared.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when running free, it is impossible to lash the wheel, so I faced an all-night watch.&nbsp; Maud insisted on relieving me, but proved that she had not the strength to steer in a heavy sea, even if she could have gained the wisdom on such short notice.&nbsp; She appeared quite heart-broken over the discovery, but recovered her spirits by coiling down tackles and halyards and all stray ropes.&nbsp; Then there were meals to be cooked in the galley, beds to make, Wolf Larsen to be attended upon, and she finished the day with a grand house-cleaning attack upon the cabin and steerage.</p>
<p>
	All night I steered, without relief, the wind slowly and steadily increasing and the sea rising.&nbsp; At five in the morning Maud brought me hot coffee and biscuits she had baked, and at seven a substantial and piping hot breakfast put new lift into me.</p>
<p>
	Throughout the day, and as slowly and steadily as ever, the wind increased.&nbsp; It impressed one with its sullen determination to blow, and blow harder, and keep on blowing.&nbsp; And still the <em>Ghost </em>foamed along, racing off the miles till I was certain she was making at least eleven knots.&nbsp; It was too good to lose, but by nightfall I was exhausted.&nbsp; Though in splendid physical trim, a thirty-six-hour trick at the wheel was the limit of my endurance.&nbsp; Besides, Maud begged me to heave to, and I knew, if the wind and sea increased at the same rate during the night, that it would soon be impossible to heave to.&nbsp; So, as twilight deepened, gladly and at the same time reluctantly, I brought the <em>Ghost </em>up on the wind.</p>
<p>
	But I had not reckoned upon the colossal task the reefing of three sails meant for one man.&nbsp; While running away from the wind I had not appreciated its force, but when we ceased to run I learned to my sorrow, and well-nigh to my despair, how fiercely it was really blowing.&nbsp; The wind balked my every effort, ripping the canvas out of my hands and in an instant undoing what I had gained by ten minutes of severest struggle.&nbsp; At eight o&rsquo;clock I had succeeded only in putting the second reef into the foresail.&nbsp; At eleven o&rsquo;clock I was no farther along.&nbsp; Blood dripped from every finger-end, while the nails were broken to the quick.&nbsp; From pain and sheer exhaustion I wept in the darkness, secretly, so that Maud should not know.</p>
<p>
	Then, in desperation, I abandoned the attempt to reef the mainsail and resolved to try the experiment of heaving to under the close-reefed foresail.&nbsp; Three hours more were required to gasket the mainsail and jib, and at two in the morning, nearly dead, the life almost buffeted and worked out of me, I had barely sufficient consciousness to know the experiment was a success.&nbsp; The close-reefed foresail worked.&nbsp; The<em> Ghost </em>clung on close to the wind and betrayed no inclination to fall off broadside to the trough.</p>
<p>
	I was famished, but Maud tried vainly to get me to eat.&nbsp; I dozed with my mouth full of food.&nbsp; I would fall asleep in the act of carrying food to my mouth and waken in torment to find the act yet uncompleted.&nbsp; So sleepily helpless was I that she was compelled to hold me in my chair to prevent my being flung to the floor by the violent pitching of the schooner.</p>
<p>
	Of the passage from the galley to the cabin I knew nothing.&nbsp; It was a sleep-walker Maud guided and supported.&nbsp; In fact, I was aware of nothing till I awoke, how long after I could not imagine, in my bunk with my boots off.&nbsp; It was dark.&nbsp; I was stiff and lame, and cried out with pain when the bed-clothes touched my poor finger-ends.</p>
<p>
	Morning had evidently not come, so I closed my eyes and went to sleep again.&nbsp; I did not know it, but I had slept the clock around and it was night again.</p>
<p>
	Once more I woke, troubled because I could sleep no better.&nbsp; I struck a match and looked at my watch.&nbsp; It marked midnight.&nbsp; And I had not left the deck until three!&nbsp; I should have been puzzled had I not guessed the solution.&nbsp; No wonder I was sleeping brokenly.&nbsp; I had slept twenty-one hours.&nbsp; I listened for a while to the behaviour of the <em>Ghost,</em> to the pounding of the seas and the muffled roar of the wind on deck, and then turned over on my ride and slept peacefully until morning.</p>
<p>
	When I arose at seven I saw no sign of Maud and concluded she was in the galley preparing breakfast.&nbsp; On deck I found the<em> Ghost </em>doing splendidly under her patch of canvas.&nbsp; But in the galley, though a fire was burning and water boiling, I found no Maud.</p>
<p>
	I discovered her in the steerage, by Wolf Larsen&rsquo;s bunk.&nbsp; I looked at him, the man who had been hurled down from the topmost pitch of life to be buried alive and be worse than dead.&nbsp; There seemed a relaxation of his expressionless face which was new.&nbsp; Maud looked at me and I understood.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;His life flickered out in the storm,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But he still lives,&rdquo; she answered, infinite faith in her voice.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He had too great strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but now it no longer shackles him.&nbsp; He is a free spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He is a free spirit surely,&rdquo; I answered; and, taking her hand, I led her on deck.</p>
<p>
	The storm broke that night, which is to say that it diminished as slowly as it had arisen.&nbsp; After breakfast next morning, when I had hoisted Wolf Larsen&rsquo;s body on deck ready for burial, it was still blowing heavily and a large sea was running.&nbsp; The deck was continually awash with the sea which came inboard over the rail and through the scuppers.&nbsp; The wind smote the schooner with a sudden gust, and she heeled over till her lee rail was buried, the roar in her rigging rising in pitch to a shriek.&nbsp; We stood in the water to our knees as I bared my head.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I remember only one part of the service,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and that is, &lsquo;And the body shall be cast into the sea.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Maud looked at me, surprised and shocked; but the spirit of something I had seen before was strong upon me, impelling me to give service to Wolf Larsen as Wolf Larsen had once given service to another man.&nbsp; I lifted the end of the hatch cover and the canvas-shrouded body slipped feet first into the sea.&nbsp; The weight of iron dragged it down.&nbsp; It was gone.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Good-bye, Lucifer, proud spirit,&rdquo; Maud whispered, so low that it was drowned by the shouting of the wind; but I saw the movement of her lips and knew.</p>
<p>
	As we clung to the lee rail and worked our way aft, I happened to glance to leeward.&nbsp; The <em>Ghost,</em> at the moment, was uptossed on a sea, and I caught a clear view of a small steamship two or three miles away, rolling and pitching, head on to the sea, as it steamed toward us.&nbsp; It was painted black, and from the talk of the hunters of their poaching exploits I recognized it as a United States revenue cutter.&nbsp; I pointed it out to Maud and hurriedly led her aft to the safety of the poop.</p>
<p>
	I started to rush below to the flag-locker, then remembered that in rigging the <em>Ghost.</em>&nbsp; I had forgotten to make provision for a flag-halyard.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We need no distress signal,&rdquo; Maud said.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have only to see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We are saved,&rdquo; I said, soberly and solemnly.&nbsp; And then, in an exuberance of joy, &ldquo;I hardly know whether to be glad or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I looked at her.&nbsp; Our eyes were not loath to meet.&nbsp; We leaned toward each other, and before I knew it my arms were about her.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Need I?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>
	And she answered, &ldquo;There is no need, though the telling of it would be sweet, so sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Her lips met the press of mine, and, by what strange trick of the imagination I know not, the scene in the cabin of the <em>Ghost </em>flashed upon me, when she had pressed her fingers lightly on my lips and said, &ldquo;Hush, hush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;My woman, my one small woman,&rdquo; I said, my free hand petting her shoulder in the way all lovers know though never learn in school.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;My man,&rdquo; she said, looking at me for an instant with tremulous lids which fluttered down and veiled her eyes as she snuggled her head against my breast with a happy little sigh.</p>
<p>
	I looked toward the cutter.&nbsp; It was very close.&nbsp; A boat was being lowered.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;One kiss, dear love,&rdquo; I whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;One kiss more before they come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And rescue us from ourselves,&rdquo; she completed, with a most adorable smile, whimsical as I had never seen it, for it was whimsical with love.</p>
