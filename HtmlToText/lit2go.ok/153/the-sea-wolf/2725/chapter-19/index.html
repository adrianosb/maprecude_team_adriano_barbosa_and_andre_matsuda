                <p>
	I came on deck to find the<em> Ghost </em>heading up close on the port tack and cutting in to windward of a familiar spritsail close-hauled on the same tack ahead of us.&nbsp; All hands were on deck, for they knew that something was to happen when Leach and Johnson were dragged aboard.</p>
<p>
	It was four bells.&nbsp; Louis came aft to relieve the wheel.&nbsp; There was a dampness in the air, and I noticed he had on his oilskins.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What are we going to have?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A healthy young slip of a gale from the breath iv it, sir,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;with a splatter iv rain just to wet our gills an&rsquo; no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Too bad we sighted them,&rdquo; I said, as the <em>Ghost&rsquo;s </em>bow was flung off a point by a large sea and the boat leaped for a moment past the jibs and into our line of vision.</p>
<p>
	Louis gave a spoke and temporized.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;d never iv made the land, sir, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Think not?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No, sir.&nbsp; Did you feel that?&rdquo;&nbsp; (A puff had caught the schooner, and he was forced to put the wheel up rapidly to keep her out of the wind.)&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no egg-shell&rsquo;ll float on this sea an hour come, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a stroke iv luck for them we&rsquo;re here to pick &rsquo;em up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Wolf Larsen strode aft from amidships, where he had been talking with the rescued men.&nbsp; The cat-like springiness in his tread was a little more pronounced than usual, and his eyes were bright and snappy.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Three oilers and a fourth engineer,&rdquo; was his greeting.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll make sailors out of them, or boat-pullers at any rate.&nbsp; Now, what of the lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I know not why, but I was aware of a twinge or pang like the cut of a knife when he mentioned her.&nbsp; I thought it a certain silly fastidiousness on my part, but it persisted in spite of me, and I merely shrugged my shoulders in answer.</p>
<p>
	Wolf Larsen pursed his lips in a long, quizzical whistle.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name, then?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is asleep.&nbsp; She was very tired.&nbsp; In fact, I am waiting to hear the news from you.&nbsp; What vessel was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Mail steamer,&rdquo; he answered shortly.&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>The City of Tokio,</em> from &rsquo;Frisco, bound for Yokohama.&nbsp; Disabled in that typhoon.&nbsp; Old tub.&nbsp; Opened up top and bottom like a sieve.&nbsp; They were adrift four days.&nbsp; And you don&rsquo;t know who or what she is, eh?&mdash;maid, wife, or widow?&nbsp; Well, well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He shook his head in a bantering way, and regarded me with laughing eyes.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Are you&mdash;&rdquo; I began.&nbsp; It was on the verge of my tongue to ask if he were going to take the castaways into Yokohama.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Am I what?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What do you intend doing with Leach and Johnson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Really, Hump, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; You see, with these additions I&rsquo;ve about all the crew I want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And they&rsquo;ve about all the escaping they want,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not give them a change of treatment?&nbsp; Take them aboard, and deal gently with them.&nbsp; Whatever they have done they have been hounded into doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;By me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;By you,&rdquo; I answered steadily.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I give you warning, Wolf Larsen, that I may forget love of my own life in the desire to kill you if you go too far in maltreating those poor wretches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do me proud, Hump!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve found your legs with a vengeance.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re quite an individual.&nbsp; You were unfortunate in having your life cast in easy places, but you&rsquo;re developing, and I like you the better for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	His voice and expression changed.&nbsp; His face was serious.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you believe in promises?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are they sacred things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Then here&rsquo;s a compact,&rdquo; he went on, consummate actor.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I promise not to lay my hands upon Leach will you promise, in turn, not to attempt to kill me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, not that I&rsquo;m afraid of you, not that I&rsquo;m afraid of you,&rdquo; he hastened to add.</p>
<p>
	I could hardly believe my ears.&nbsp; What was coming over the man?</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Is it a go?&rdquo; he asked impatiently.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A go,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>
	His hand went out to mine, and as I shook it heartily I could have sworn I saw the mocking devil shine up for a moment in his eyes.</p>
<p>
	We strolled across the poop to the lee side.&nbsp; The boat was close at hand now, and in desperate plight.&nbsp; Johnson was steering, Leach bailing.&nbsp; We overhauled them about two feet to their one.&nbsp; Wolf Larsen motioned Louis to keep off slightly, and we dashed abreast of the boat, not a score of feet to windward.&nbsp; The <em>Ghost </em>blanketed it.&nbsp; The spritsail flapped emptily and the boat righted to an even keel, causing the two men swiftly to change position.&nbsp; The boat lost headway, and, as we lifted on a huge surge, toppled and fell into the trough.</p>
<p>
	It was at this moment that Leach and Johnson looked up into the faces of their shipmates, who lined the rail amidships.&nbsp; There was no greeting.&nbsp; They were as dead men in their comrades&rsquo; eyes, and between them was the gulf that parts the living and the dead.</p>
<p>
	The next instant they were opposite the poop, where stood Wolf Larsen and I.&nbsp; We were falling in the trough, they were rising on the surge.&nbsp; Johnson looked at me, and I could see that his face was worn and haggard.&nbsp; I waved my hand to him, and he answered the greeting, but with a wave that was hopeless and despairing.&nbsp; It was as if he were saying farewell.&nbsp; I did not see into the eyes of Leach, for he was looking at Wolf Larsen, the old and implacable snarl of hatred strong as ever on his face.</p>
<p>
	Then they were gone astern.&nbsp; The spritsail filled with the wind, suddenly, careening the frail open craft till it seemed it would surely capsize.&nbsp; A whitecap foamed above it and broke across in a snow-white smother.&nbsp; Then the boat emerged, half swamped, Leach flinging the water out and Johnson clinging to the steering-oar, his face white and anxious.</p>
<p>
	Wolf Larsen barked a short laugh in my ear and strode away to the weather side of the poop.&nbsp; I expected him to give orders for the <em>Ghost </em>to heave to, but she kept on her course and he made no sign.&nbsp; Louis stood imperturbably at the wheel, but I noticed the grouped sailors forward turning troubled faces in our direction.&nbsp; Still the<em> Ghost</em> tore along, till the boat dwindled to a speck, when Wolf Larsen&rsquo;s voice rang out in command and he went about on the starboard tack.</p>
<p>
	Back we held, two miles and more to windward of the struggling cockle-shell, when the flying jib was run down and the schooner hove to.&nbsp; The sealing boats are not made for windward work.&nbsp; Their hope lies in keeping a weather position so that they may run before the wind for the schooner when it breezes up.&nbsp; But in all that wild waste there was no refuge for Leach and Johnson save on the <em>Ghost,</em> and they resolutely began the windward beat.&nbsp; It was slow work in the heavy sea that was running.&nbsp; At any moment they were liable to be overwhelmed by the hissing combers.&nbsp; Time and again and countless times we watched the boat luff into the big whitecaps, lose headway, and be flung back like a cork.</p>
<p>
	Johnson was a splendid seaman, and he knew as much about small boats as he did about ships.&nbsp; At the end of an hour and a half he was nearly alongside, standing past our stern on the last leg out, aiming to fetch us on the next leg back.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve changed your mind?&rdquo; I heard Wolf Larsen mutter, half to himself, half to them as though they could hear.&nbsp; &ldquo;You want to come aboard, eh?&nbsp; Well, then, just keep a-coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Hard up with that helm!&rdquo; he commanded Oofty-Oofty, the Kanaka, who had in the meantime relieved Louis at the wheel.</p>
<p>
	Command followed command.&nbsp; As the schooner paid off, the fore- and main-sheets were slacked away for fair wind.&nbsp; And before the wind we were, and leaping, when Johnson, easing his sheet at imminent peril, cut across our wake a hundred feet away.&nbsp; Again Wolf Larsen laughed, at the same time beckoning them with his arm to follow.&nbsp; It was evidently his intention to play with them,&mdash;a lesson, I took it, in lieu of a beating, though a dangerous lesson, for the frail craft stood in momentary danger of being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>
	Johnson squared away promptly and ran after us.&nbsp; There was nothing else for him to do.&nbsp; Death stalked everywhere, and it was only a matter of time when some one of those many huge seas would fall upon the boat, roll over it, and pass on.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the fear iv death at the hearts iv them,&rdquo; Louis muttered in my ear, as I passed forward to see to taking in the flying jib and staysail.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll heave to in a little while and pick them up,&rdquo; I answered cheerfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s bent upon giving them a lesson, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Louis looked at me shrewdly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Think so?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I think nothing but iv my own skin, these days,&rdquo; was his answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; &rsquo;tis with wonder I&rsquo;m filled as to the workin&rsquo; out iv things.&nbsp; A pretty mess that &rsquo;Frisco whisky got me into, an&rsquo; a prettier mess that woman&rsquo;s got you into aft there.&nbsp; Ah, it&rsquo;s myself that knows ye for a blitherin&rsquo; fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I demanded; for, having sped his shaft, he was turning away.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What do I mean?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s you that asks me!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not what I mean, but what the Wolf &rsquo;ll mean.&nbsp; The Wolf, I said, the Wolf!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;If trouble comes, will you stand by?&rdquo; I asked impulsively, for he had voiced my own fear.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Stand by?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis old fat Louis I stand by, an&rsquo; trouble enough it&rsquo;ll be.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re at the beginnin&rsquo; iv things, I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ye, the bare beginnin&rsquo; iv things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I had not thought you so great a coward,&rdquo; I sneered.</p>
<p>
	He favoured me with a contemptuous stare.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I raised never a hand for that poor fool,&rdquo;&mdash;pointing astern to the tiny sail,&mdash;&ldquo;d&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;m hungerin&rsquo; for a broken head for a woman I never laid me eyes upon before this day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I turned scornfully away and went aft.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Better get in those topsails, Mr. Van Weyden,&rdquo; Wolf Larsen said, as I came on the poop.</p>
<p>
	I felt relief, at least as far as the two men were concerned.&nbsp; It was clear he did not wish to run too far away from them.&nbsp; I picked up hope at the thought and put the order swiftly into execution.&nbsp; I had scarcely opened my mouth to issue the necessary commands, when eager men were springing to halyards and downhauls, and others were racing aloft.&nbsp; This eagerness on their part was noted by Wolf Larsen with a grim smile.</p>
<p>
	Still we increased our lead, and when the boat had dropped astern several miles we hove to and waited.&nbsp; All eyes watched it coming, even Wolf Larsen&rsquo;s; but he was the only unperturbed man aboard.&nbsp; Louis, gazing fixedly, betrayed a trouble in his face he was not quite able to hide.</p>
<p>
	The boat drew closer and closer, hurling along through the seething green like a thing alive, lifting and sending and uptossing across the huge-backed breakers, or disappearing behind them only to rush into sight again and shoot skyward.&nbsp; It seemed impossible that it could continue to live, yet with each dizzying sweep it did achieve the impossible.&nbsp; A rain-squall drove past, and out of the flying wet the boat emerged, almost upon us.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Hard up, there!&rdquo; Wolf Larsen shouted, himself springing to the wheel and whirling it over.</p>
<p>
	Again the<em> Ghost</em> sprang away and raced before the wind, and for two hours Johnson and Leach pursued us.&nbsp; We hove to and ran away, hove to and ran away, and ever astern the struggling patch of sail tossed skyward and fell into the rushing valleys.&nbsp; It was a quarter of a mile away when a thick squall of rain veiled it from view.&nbsp; It never emerged.&nbsp; The wind blew the air clear again, but no patch of sail broke the troubled surface.&nbsp; I thought I saw, for an instant, the boat&rsquo;s bottom show black in a breaking crest.&nbsp; At the best, that was all.&nbsp; For Johnson and Leach the travail of existence had ceased.</p>
<p>
	The men remained grouped amidships.&nbsp; No one had gone below, and no one was speaking.&nbsp; Nor were any looks being exchanged.&nbsp; Each man seemed stunned&mdash;deeply contemplative, as it were, and, not quite sure, trying to realize just what had taken place.&nbsp; Wolf Larsen gave them little time for thought.&nbsp; He at once put the <em>Ghost </em>upon her course&mdash;a course which meant the seal herd and not Yokohama harbour.&nbsp; But the men were no longer eager as they pulled and hauled, and I heard curses amongst them, which left their lips smothered and as heavy and lifeless as were they.&nbsp; Not so was it with the hunters.&nbsp; Smoke the irrepressible related a story, and they descended into the steerage, bellowing with laughter.</p>
<p>
	As I passed to leeward of the galley on my way aft I was approached by the engineer we had rescued.&nbsp; His face was white, his lips were trembling.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Good God! sir, what kind of a craft is this?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You have eyes, you have seen,&rdquo; I answered, almost brutally, what of the pain and fear at my own heart.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Your promise?&rdquo; I said to Wolf Larsen.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I was not thinking of taking them aboard when I made that promise,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;And anyway, you&rsquo;ll agree I&rsquo;ve not laid my hands upon them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Far from it, far from it,&rdquo; he laughed a moment later.</p>
<p>
	I made no reply.&nbsp; I was incapable of speaking, my mind was too confused.&nbsp; I must have time to think, I knew.&nbsp; This woman, sleeping even now in the spare cabin, was a responsibility, which I must consider, and the only rational thought that flickered through my mind was that I must do nothing hastily if I were to be any help to her at all.</p>
