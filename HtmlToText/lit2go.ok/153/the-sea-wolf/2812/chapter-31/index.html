	&ldquo;It will smell,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but it will keep in the heat and keep out the rain and snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	We were surveying the completed seal-skin roof.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It is clumsy, but it will serve the purpose, and that is the main thing,&rdquo; I went on, yearning for her praise.</p>
<p>
	And she clapped her hands and declared that she was hugely pleased.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But it is dark in here,&rdquo; she said the next moment, her shoulders shrinking with a little involuntary shiver.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You might have suggested a window when the walls were going up,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was for you, and you should have seen the need of a window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But I never do see the obvious, you know,&rdquo; she laughed back.&nbsp; &ldquo;And besides, you can knock a hole in the wall at any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Quite true; I had not thought of it,&rdquo; I replied, wagging my head sagely.&nbsp; &ldquo;But have you thought of ordering the window-glass?&nbsp; Just call up the firm,&mdash;Red, 4451, I think it is,&mdash;and tell them what size and kind of glass you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;That means&mdash;&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	It was a dark and evil-appearing thing, that hut, not fit for aught better than swine in a civilized land; but for us, who had known the misery of the open boat, it was a snug little habitation.&nbsp; Following the housewarming, which was accomplished by means of seal-oil and a wick made from cotton calking, came the hunting for our winter&rsquo;s meat and the building of the second hut.&nbsp; It was a simple affair, now, to go forth in the morning and return by noon with a boatload of seals.&nbsp; And then, while I worked at building the hut, Maud tried out the oil from the blubber and kept a slow fire under the frames of meat.&nbsp; I had heard of jerking beef on the plains, and our seal-meat, cut in thin strips and hung in the smoke, cured excellently.</p>
<p>
	The second hut was easier to erect, for I built it against the first, and only three walls were required.&nbsp; But it was work, hard work, all of it.&nbsp; Maud and I worked from dawn till dark, to the limit of our strength, so that when night came we crawled stiffly to bed and slept the animal-like sleep exhaustion.&nbsp; And yet Maud declared that she had never felt better or stronger in her life.&nbsp; I knew this was true of myself, but hers was such a lily strength that I feared she would break down.&nbsp; Often and often, her last-reserve force gone, I have seen her stretched flat on her back on the sand in the way she had of resting and recuperating.&nbsp; And then she would be up on her feet and toiling hard as ever.&nbsp; Where she obtained this strength was the marvel to me.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Think of the long rest this winter,&rdquo; was her reply to my remonstrances.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ll be clamorous for something to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	We held a housewarming in my hut the night it was roofed.&nbsp; It was the end of the third day of a fierce storm which had swung around the compass from the south-east to the north-west, and which was then blowing directly in upon us.&nbsp; The beaches of the outer cove were thundering with the surf, and even in our land-locked inner cove a respectable sea was breaking.&nbsp; No high backbone of island sheltered us from the wind, and it whistled and bellowed about the hut till at times I feared for the strength of the walls.&nbsp; The skin roof, stretched tightly as a drumhead, I had thought, sagged and bellied with every gust; and innumerable interstices in the walls, not so tightly stuffed with moss as Maud had supposed, disclosed themselves.&nbsp; Yet the seal-oil burned brightly and we were warm and comfortable.</p>
<p>
	It was a pleasant evening indeed, and we voted that as a social function on Endeavour Island it had not yet been eclipsed.&nbsp; Our minds were at ease.&nbsp; Not only had we resigned ourselves to the bitter winter, but we were prepared for it.&nbsp; The seals could depart on their mysterious journey into the south at any time, now, for all we cared; and the storms held no terror for us.&nbsp; Not only were we sure of being dry and warm and sheltered from the wind, but we had the softest and most luxurious mattresses that could be made from moss.&nbsp; This had been Maud&rsquo;s idea, and she had herself jealously gathered all the moss.&nbsp; This was to be my first night on the mattress, and I knew I should sleep the sweeter because she had made it.</p>
<p>
	As she rose to go she turned to me with the whimsical way she had, and said:</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Something is going to happen&mdash;is happening, for that matter.&nbsp; I feel it.&nbsp; Something is coming here, to us.&nbsp; It is coming now.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what, but it is coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Good or bad?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>
	She shook her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but it is there, somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She pointed in the direction of the sea and wind.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lee shore,&rdquo; I laughed, &ldquo;and I am sure I&rsquo;d rather be here than arriving, a night like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You are not frightened?&rdquo; I asked, as I stepped to open the door for her.</p>
<p>
	Her eyes looked bravely into mine.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And you feel well? perfectly well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Never better,&rdquo; was her answer.</p>
<p>
	We talked a little longer before she went.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Good-night, Maud,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Good-night, Humphrey,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>
	This use of our given names had come about quite as a matter of course, and was as unpremeditated as it was natural.&nbsp; In that moment I could have put my arms around her and drawn her to me.&nbsp; I should certainly have done so out in that world to which we belonged.&nbsp; As it was, the situation stopped there in the only way it could; but I was left alone in my little hut, glowing warmly through and through with a pleasant satisfaction; and I knew that a tie, or a tacit something, existed between us which had not existed before.</p>
