                <p>
	Sometimes I think Wolf Larsen mad, or half-mad at least, what of his strange moods and vagaries.&nbsp; At other times I take him for a great man, a genius who has never arrived.&nbsp; And, finally, I am convinced that he is the perfect type of the primitive man, born a thousand years or generations too late and an anachronism in this culminating century of civilization.&nbsp; He is certainly an individualist of the most pronounced type.&nbsp; Not only that, but he is very lonely.&nbsp; There is no congeniality between him and the rest of the men aboard ship.&nbsp; His tremendous virility and mental strength wall him apart.&nbsp; They are more like children to him, even the hunters, and as children he treats them, descending perforce to their level and playing with them as a man plays with puppies.&nbsp; Or else he probes them with the cruel hand of a vivisectionist, groping about in their mental processes and examining their souls as though to see of what soul-stuff is made.</p>
<p>
	I have seen him a score of times, at table, insulting this hunter or that, with cool and level eyes and, withal, a certain air of interest, pondering their actions or replies or petty rages with a curiosity almost laughable to me who stood onlooker and who understood.&nbsp; Concerning his own rages, I am convinced that they are not real, that they are sometimes experiments, but that in the main they are the habits of a pose or attitude he has seen fit to take toward his fellow-men.&nbsp; I know, with the possible exception of the incident of the dead mate, that I have not seen him really angry; nor do I wish ever to see him in a genuine rage, when all the force of him is called into play.</p>
<p>
	While on the question of vagaries, I shall tell what befell Thomas Mugridge in the cabin, and at the same time complete an incident upon which I have already touched once or twice.&nbsp; The twelve o&rsquo;clock dinner was over, one day, and I had just finished putting the cabin in order, when Wolf Larsen and Thomas Mugridge descended the companion stairs.&nbsp; Though the cook had a cubby-hole of a state-room opening off from the cabin, in the cabin itself he had never dared to linger or to be seen, and he flitted to and fro, once or twice a day, a timid spectre.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So you know how to play &lsquo;Nap,&rsquo;&rdquo; Wolf Larsen was saying in a pleased sort of voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I might have guessed an Englishman would know.&nbsp; I learned it myself in English ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Thomas Mugridge was beside himself, a blithering imbecile, so pleased was he at chumming thus with the captain.&nbsp; The little airs he put on and the painful striving to assume the easy carriage of a man born to a dignified place in life would have been sickening had they not been ludicrous.&nbsp; He quite ignored my presence, though I credited him with being simply unable to see me.&nbsp; His pale, wishy-washy eyes were swimming like lazy summer seas, though what blissful visions they beheld were beyond my imagination.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Get the cards, Hump,&rdquo; Wolf Larsen ordered, as they took seats at the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;And bring out the cigars and the whisky you&rsquo;ll find in my berth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I returned with the articles in time to hear the Cockney hinting broadly that there was a mystery about him, that he might be a gentleman&rsquo;s son gone wrong or something or other; also, that he was a remittance man and was paid to keep away from England&mdash;&ldquo;p&rsquo;yed &rsquo;ansomely, sir,&rdquo; was the way he put it; &ldquo;p&rsquo;yed &rsquo;ansomely to sling my &rsquo;ook an&rsquo; keep slingin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I had brought the customary liquor glasses, but Wolf Larsen frowned, shook his head, and signalled with his hands for me to bring the tumblers.&nbsp; These he filled two-thirds full with undiluted whisky&mdash;&ldquo;a gentleman&rsquo;s drink?&rdquo; quoth Thomas Mugridge,&mdash;and they clinked their glasses to the glorious game of &ldquo;Nap,&rdquo; lighted cigars, and fell to shuffling and dealing the cards.</p>
<p>
	They played for money.&nbsp; They increased the amounts of the bets.&nbsp; They drank whisky, they drank it neat, and I fetched more.&nbsp; I do not know whether Wolf Larsen cheated or not,&mdash;a thing he was thoroughly capable of doing,&mdash;but he won steadily.&nbsp; The cook made repeated journeys to his bunk for money.&nbsp; Each time he performed the journey with greater swagger, but he never brought more than a few dollars at a time.&nbsp; He grew maudlin, familiar, could hardly see the cards or sit upright.&nbsp; As a preliminary to another journey to his bunk, he hooked Wolf Larsen&rsquo;s buttonhole with a greasy forefinger and vacuously proclaimed and reiterated, &ldquo;I got money, I got money, I tell yer, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m a gentleman&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Wolf Larsen was unaffected by the drink, yet he drank glass for glass, and if anything his glasses were fuller.&nbsp; There was no change in him.&nbsp; He did not appear even amused at the other&rsquo;s antics.</p>
<p>
	In the end, with loud protestations that he could lose like a gentleman, the cook&rsquo;s last money was staked on the game&mdash;and lost.&nbsp; Whereupon he leaned his head on his hands and wept.&nbsp; Wolf Larsen looked curiously at him, as though about to probe and vivisect him, then changed his mind, as from the foregone conclusion that there was nothing there to probe.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Hump,&rdquo; he said to me, elaborately polite, &ldquo;kindly take Mr. Mugridge&rsquo;s arm and help him up on deck.&nbsp; He is not feeling very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And tell Johnson to douse him with a few buckets of salt water,&rdquo; he added, in a lower tone for my ear alone.</p>
<p>
	I left Mr. Mugridge on deck, in the hands of a couple of grinning sailors who had been told off for the purpose.&nbsp; Mr. Mugridge was sleepily spluttering that he was a gentleman&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; But as I descended the companion stairs to clear the table I heard him shriek as the first bucket of water struck him.</p>
<p>
	Wolf Larsen was counting his winnings.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;One hundred and eighty-five dollars even,&rdquo; he said aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just as I thought.&nbsp; The beggar came aboard without a cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And what you have won is mine, sir,&rdquo; I said boldly.</p>
<p>
	He favoured me with a quizzical smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hump, I have studied some grammar in my time, and I think your tenses are tangled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Was mine,&rsquo; you should have said, not &rsquo;is mine.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It is a question, not of grammar, but of ethics,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>
	It was possibly a minute before he spoke.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye know, Hump,&rdquo; he said, with a slow seriousness which had in it an indefinable strain of sadness, &ldquo;that this is the first time I have heard the word &lsquo;ethics&rsquo; in the mouth of a man.&nbsp; You and I are the only men on this ship who know its meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;At one time in my life,&rdquo; he continued, after another pause, &ldquo;I dreamed that I might some day talk with men who used such language, that I might lift myself out of the place in life in which I had been born, and hold conversation and mingle with men who talked about just such things as ethics.&nbsp; And this is the first time I have ever heard the word pronounced.&nbsp; Which is all by the way, for you are wrong.&nbsp; It is a question neither of grammar nor ethics, but of fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fact is that you have the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	His face brightened.&nbsp; He seemed pleased at my perspicacity.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it is avoiding the real question,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;which is one of right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he remarked, with a wry pucker of his mouth, &ldquo;I see you still believe in such things as right and wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you?&mdash;at all?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Not the least bit.&nbsp; Might is right, and that is all there is to it.&nbsp; Weakness is wrong.&nbsp; Which is a very poor way of saying that it is good for oneself to be strong, and evil for oneself to be weak&mdash;or better yet, it is pleasurable to be strong, because of the profits; painful to be weak, because of the penalties.&nbsp; Just now the possession of this money is a pleasurable thing.&nbsp; It is good for one to possess it.&nbsp; Being able to possess it, I wrong myself and the life that is in me if I give it to you and forego the pleasure of possessing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But you wrong me by withholding it,&rdquo; I objected.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Not at all.&nbsp; One man cannot wrong another man.&nbsp; He can only wrong himself.&nbsp; As I see it, I do wrong always when I consider the interests of others.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see?&nbsp; How can two particles of the yeast wrong each other by striving to devour each other?&nbsp; It is their inborn heritage to strive to devour, and to strive not to be devoured.&nbsp; When they depart from this they sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t believe in altruism?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>
	He received the word as if it had a familiar ring, though he pondered it thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me see, it means something about co&ouml;peration, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, in a way there has come to be a sort of connection,&rdquo; I answered unsurprised by this time at such gaps in his vocabulary, which, like his knowledge, was the acquirement of a self-read, self-educated man, whom no one had directed in his studies, and who had thought much and talked little or not at all.&nbsp; &ldquo;An altruistic act is an act performed for the welfare of others.&nbsp; It is unselfish, as opposed to an act performed for self, which is selfish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He nodded his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember it now.&nbsp; I ran across it in Spencer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Spencer!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you read him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; was his confession.&nbsp; &ldquo;I understood quite a good deal of <em>First Principles,</em> but his <em>Biology</em> took the wind out of my sails, and his <em>Psychology </em>left me butting around in the doldrums for many a day.&nbsp; I honestly could not understand what he was driving at.&nbsp; I put it down to mental deficiency on my part, but since then I have decided that it was for want of preparation.&nbsp; I had no proper basis.&nbsp; Only Spencer and myself know how hard I hammered.&nbsp; But I did get something out of his <em>Data of Ethics.</em>&nbsp; There&rsquo;s where I ran across &lsquo;altruism,&rsquo; and I remember now how it was used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I wondered what this man could have got from such a work.&nbsp; Spencer I remembered enough to know that altruism was imperative to his ideal of highest conduct.&nbsp; Wolf Larsen, evidently, had sifted the great philosopher&rsquo;s teachings, rejecting and selecting according to his needs and desires.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What else did you run across?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>
	His brows drew in slightly with the mental effort of suitably phrasing thoughts which he had never before put into speech.&nbsp; I felt an elation of spirit.&nbsp; I was groping into his soul-stuff as he made a practice of groping in the soul-stuff of others.&nbsp; I was exploring virgin territory.&nbsp; A strange, a terribly strange, region was unrolling itself before my eyes.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;In as few words as possible,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;Spencer puts it something like this: First, a man must act for his own benefit&mdash;to do this is to be moral and good.&nbsp; Next, he must act for the benefit of his children.&nbsp; And third, he must act for the benefit of his race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And the highest, finest, right conduct,&rdquo; I interjected, &ldquo;is that act which benefits at the same time the man, his children, and his race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t stand for that,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t see the necessity for it, nor the common sense.&nbsp; I cut out the race and the children.&nbsp; I would sacrifice nothing for them.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just so much slush and sentiment, and you must see it yourself, at least for one who does not believe in eternal life.&nbsp; With immortality before me, altruism would be a paying business proposition.&nbsp; I might elevate my soul to all kinds of altitudes.&nbsp; But with nothing eternal before me but death, given for a brief spell this yeasty crawling and squirming which is called life, why, it would be immoral for me to perform any act that was a sacrifice.&nbsp; Any sacrifice that makes me lose one crawl or squirm is foolish,&mdash;and not only foolish, for it is a wrong against myself and a wicked thing.&nbsp; I must not lose one crawl or squirm if I am to get the most out of the ferment.&nbsp; Nor will the eternal movelessness that is coming to me be made easier or harder by the sacrifices or selfishnesses of the time when I was yeasty and acrawl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Then you are an individualist, a materialist, and, logically, a hedonist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Big words,&rdquo; he smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what is a hedonist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He nodded agreement when I had given the definition.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you are also,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;a man one could not trust in the least thing where it was possible for a selfish interest to intervene?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re beginning to understand,&rdquo; he said, brightening.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You are a man utterly without what the world calls morals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A man of whom to be always afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to put it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;As one is afraid of a snake, or a tiger, or a shark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Now you know me,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you know me as I am generally known.&nbsp; Other men call me &lsquo;Wolf.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You are a sort of monster,&rdquo; I added audaciously, &ldquo;a Caliban who has pondered Setebos, and who acts as you act, in idle moments, by whim and fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	His brow clouded at the allusion.&nbsp; He did not understand, and I quickly learned that he did not know the poem.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just reading Browning,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s pretty tough.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t got very far along, and as it is I&rsquo;ve about lost my bearings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Not to be tiresome, I shall say that I fetched the book from his state-room and read &ldquo;Caliban&rdquo; aloud.&nbsp; He was delighted.&nbsp; It was a primitive mode of reasoning and of looking at things that he understood thoroughly.&nbsp; He interrupted again and again with comment and criticism.&nbsp; When I finished, he had me read it over a second time, and a third.&nbsp; We fell into discussion&mdash;philosophy, science, evolution, religion.&nbsp; He betrayed the inaccuracies of the self-read man, and, it must be granted, the sureness and directness of the primitive mind.&nbsp; The very simplicity of his reasoning was its strength, and his materialism was far more compelling than the subtly complex materialism of Charley Furuseth.&nbsp; Not that I&mdash;a confirmed and, as Furuseth phrased it, a temperamental idealist&mdash;was to be compelled; but that Wolf Larsen stormed the last strongholds of my faith with a vigour that received respect, while not accorded conviction.</p>
<p>
	Time passed.&nbsp; Supper was at hand and the table not laid.&nbsp; I became restless and anxious, and when Thomas Mugridge glared down the companion-way, sick and angry of countenance, I prepared to go about my duties.&nbsp; But Wolf Larsen cried out to him:</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Cooky, you&rsquo;ve got to hustle to-night.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m busy with Hump, and you&rsquo;ll do the best you can without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	And again the unprecedented was established.&nbsp; That night I sat at table with the captain and the hunters, while Thomas Mugridge waited on us and washed the dishes afterward&mdash;a whim, a Caliban-mood of Wolf Larsen&rsquo;s, and one I foresaw would bring me trouble.&nbsp; In the meantime we talked and talked, much to the disgust of the hunters, who could not understand a word.</p>
