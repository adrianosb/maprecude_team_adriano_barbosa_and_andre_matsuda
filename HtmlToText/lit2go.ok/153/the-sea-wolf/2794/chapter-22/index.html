                <p>
	I knew what it was as she came toward me.&nbsp; For ten minutes I had watched her talking earnestly with the engineer, and now, with a sign for silence, I drew her out of earshot of the helmsman.&nbsp; Her face was white and set; her large eyes, larger than usual what of the purpose in them, looked penetratingly into mine.&nbsp; I felt rather timid and apprehensive, for she had come to search Humphrey Van Weyden&rsquo;s soul, and Humphrey Van Weyden had nothing of which to be particularly proud since his advent on the <em>Ghost.</em></p>
<p>
	We walked to the break of the poop, where she turned and faced me.&nbsp; I glanced around to see that no one was within hearing distance.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked gently; but the expression of determination on her face did not relax.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I can readily understand,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;that this morning&rsquo;s affair was largely an accident; but I have been talking with Mr. Haskins.&nbsp; He tells me that the day we were rescued, even while I was in the cabin, two men were drowned, deliberately drowned&mdash;murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	There was a query in her voice, and she faced me accusingly, as though I were guilty of the deed, or at least a party to it.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The information is quite correct,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;The two men were murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And you permitted it!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I was unable to prevent it, is a better way of phrasing it,&rdquo; I replied, still gently.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But you tried to prevent it?&rdquo;&nbsp; There was an emphasis on the &ldquo;tried,&rdquo; and a pleading little note in her voice.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, but you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she hurried on, divining my answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I shrugged my shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must remember, Miss Brewster, that you are a new inhabitant of this little world, and that you do not yet understand the laws which operate within it.&nbsp; You bring with you certain fine conceptions of humanity, manhood, conduct, and such things; but here you will find them misconceptions.&nbsp; I have found it so,&rdquo; I added, with an involuntary sigh.</p>
<p>
	She shook her head incredulously.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What would you advise, then?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;That I should take a knife, or a gun, or an axe, and kill this man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She half started back.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No, not that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Then what should I do?&nbsp; Kill myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You speak in purely materialistic terms,&rdquo; she objected.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is such a thing as moral courage, and moral courage is never without effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I smiled, &ldquo;you advise me to kill neither him nor myself, but to let him kill me.&rdquo;&nbsp; I held up my hand as she was about to speak.&nbsp; &ldquo;For moral courage is a worthless asset on this little floating world.&nbsp; Leach, one of the men who were murdered, had moral courage to an unusual degree.&nbsp; So had the other man, Johnson.&nbsp; Not only did it not stand them in good stead, but it destroyed them.&nbsp; And so with me if I should exercise what little moral courage I may possess.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You must understand, Miss Brewster, and understand clearly, that this man is a monster.&nbsp; He is without conscience.&nbsp; Nothing is sacred to him, nothing is too terrible for him to do.&nbsp; It was due to his whim that I was detained aboard in the first place.&nbsp; It is due to his whim that I am still alive.&nbsp; I do nothing, can do nothing, because I am a slave to this monster, as you are now a slave to him; because I desire to live, as you will desire to live; because I cannot fight and overcome him, just as you will not be able to fight and overcome him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She waited for me to go on.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What remains?&nbsp; Mine is the role of the weak.&nbsp; I remain silent and suffer ignominy, as you will remain silent and suffer ignominy.&nbsp; And it is well.&nbsp; It is the best we can do if we wish to live.&nbsp; The battle is not always to the strong.&nbsp; We have not the strength with which to fight this man; we must dissimulate, and win, if win we can, by craft.&nbsp; If you will be advised by me, this is what you will do.&nbsp; I know my position is perilous, and I may say frankly that yours is even more perilous.&nbsp; We must stand together, without appearing to do so, in secret alliance.&nbsp; I shall not be able to side with you openly, and, no matter what indignities may be put upon me, you are to remain likewise silent.&nbsp; We must provoke no scenes with this man, nor cross his will.&nbsp; And we must keep smiling faces and be friendly with him no matter how repulsive it may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She brushed her hand across her forehead in a puzzled way, saying, &ldquo;Still I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You must do as I say,&rdquo; I interrupted authoritatively, for I saw Wolf Larsen&rsquo;s gaze wandering toward us from where he paced up and down with Latimer amidships.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do as I say, and ere long you will find I am right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What shall I do, then?&rdquo; she asked, detecting the anxious glance I had shot at the object of our conversation, and impressed, I flatter myself, with the earnestness of my manner.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Dispense with all the moral courage you can,&rdquo; I said briskly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t arouse this man&rsquo;s animosity.&nbsp; Be quite friendly with him, talk with him, discuss literature and art with him&mdash;he is fond of such things.&nbsp; You will find him an interested listener and no fool.&nbsp; And for your own sake try to avoid witnessing, as much as you can, the brutalities of the ship.&nbsp; It will make it easier for you to act your part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I am to lie,&rdquo; she said in steady, rebellious tones, &ldquo;by speech and action to lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Wolf Larsen had separated from Latimer and was coming toward us.&nbsp; I was desperate.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Please, please understand me,&rdquo; I said hurriedly, lowering my voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;All your experience of men and things is worthless here.&nbsp; You must begin over again.&nbsp; I know,&mdash;I can see it&mdash;you have, among other ways, been used to managing people with your eyes, letting your moral courage speak out through them, as it were.&nbsp; You have already managed me with your eyes, commanded me with them.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t try it on Wolf Larsen.&nbsp; You could as easily control a lion, while he would make a mock of you.&nbsp; He would&mdash;I have always been proud of the fact that I discovered him,&rdquo; I said, turning the conversation as Wolf Larsen stepped on the poop and joined us.&nbsp; &ldquo;The editors were afraid of him and the publishers would have none of him.&nbsp; But I knew, and his genius and my judgment were vindicated when he made that magnificent hit with his &lsquo;Forge.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And it was a newspaper poem,&rdquo; she said glibly.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It did happen to see the light in a newspaper,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but not because the magazine editors had been denied a glimpse at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We were talking of Harris,&rdquo; I said to Wolf Larsen.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he acknowledged.&nbsp; &ldquo;I remember the &lsquo;Forge.&rsquo;&nbsp; Filled with pretty sentiments and an almighty faith in human illusions.&nbsp; By the way, Mr. Van Weyden, you&rsquo;d better look in on Cooky.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s complaining and restless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Thus was I bluntly dismissed from the poop, only to find Mugridge sleeping soundly from the morphine I had given him.&nbsp; I made no haste to return on deck, and when I did I was gratified to see Miss Brewster in animated conversation with Wolf Larsen.&nbsp; As I say, the sight gratified me.&nbsp; She was following my advice.&nbsp; And yet I was conscious of a slight shock or hurt in that she was able to do the thing I had begged her to do and which she had notably disliked.</p>
