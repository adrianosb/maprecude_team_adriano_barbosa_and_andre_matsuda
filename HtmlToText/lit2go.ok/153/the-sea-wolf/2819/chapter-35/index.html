                <p>
	Next day, the mast-steps clear and everything in readiness, we started to get the two topmasts aboard.&nbsp; The maintopmast was over thirty feet in length, the foretopmast nearly thirty, and it was of these that I intended making the shears.&nbsp; It was puzzling work.&nbsp; Fastening one end of a heavy tackle to the windlass, and with the other end fast to the butt of the foretopmast, I began to heave.&nbsp; Maud held the turn on the windlass and coiled down the slack.</p>
<p>
	We were astonished at the ease with which the spar was lifted.&nbsp; It was an improved crank windlass, and the purchase it gave was enormous.&nbsp; Of course, what it gave us in power we paid for in distance; as many times as it doubled my strength, that many times was doubled the length of rope I heaved in.&nbsp; The tackle dragged heavily across the rail, increasing its drag as the spar arose more and more out of the water, and the exertion on the windlass grew severe.</p>
<p>
	But when the butt of the topmast was level with the rail, everything came to a standstill.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I might have known it,&rdquo; I said impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now we have to do it all over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Why not fasten the tackle part way down the mast?&rdquo; Maud suggested.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I should have done at first,&rdquo; I answered, hugely disgusted with myself.</p>
<p>
	Slipping off a turn, I lowered the mast back into the water and fastened the tackle a third of the way down from the butt.&nbsp; In an hour, what of this and of rests between the heaving, I had hoisted it to the point where I could hoist no more.&nbsp; Eight feet of the butt was above the rail, and I was as far away as ever from getting the spar on board.&nbsp; I sat down and pondered the problem.&nbsp; It did not take long.&nbsp; I sprang jubilantly to my feet.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Now I have it!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ought to make the tackle fast at the point of balance.&nbsp; And what we learn of this will serve us with everything else we have to hoist aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Once again I undid all my work by lowering the mast into the water.&nbsp; But I miscalculated the point of balance, so that when I heaved the top of the mast came up instead of the butt.&nbsp; Maud looked despair, but I laughed and said it would do just as well.</p>
<p>
	Instructing her how to hold the turn and be ready to slack away at command, I laid hold of the mast with my hands and tried to balance it inboard across the rail.&nbsp; When I thought I had it I cried to her to slack away; but the spar righted, despite my efforts, and dropped back toward the water.&nbsp; Again I heaved it up to its old position, for I had now another idea.&nbsp; I remembered the watch-tackle&mdash;a small double and single block affair&mdash;and fetched it.</p>
<p>
	While I was rigging it between the top of the spar and the opposite rail, Wolf Larsen came on the scene.&nbsp; We exchanged nothing more than good-mornings, and, though he could not see, he sat on the rail out of the way and followed by the sound all that I did.</p>
<p>
	Again instructing Maud to slack away at the windlass when I gave the word, I proceeded to heave on the watch-tackle.&nbsp; Slowly the mast swung in until it balanced at right angles across the rail; and then I discovered to my amazement that there was no need for Maud to slack away.&nbsp; In fact, the very opposite was necessary.&nbsp; Making the watch-tackle fast, I hove on the windlass and brought in the mast, inch by inch, till its top tilted down to the deck and finally its whole length lay on the deck.</p>
<p>
	I looked at my watch.&nbsp; It was twelve o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; My back was aching sorely, and I felt extremely tired and hungry.&nbsp; And there on the deck was a single stick of timber to show for a whole morning&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; For the first time I thoroughly realized the extent of the task before us.&nbsp; But I was learning, I was learning.&nbsp; The afternoon would show far more accomplished.&nbsp; And it did; for we returned at one o&rsquo;clock, rested and strengthened by a hearty dinner.</p>
<p>
	In less than an hour I had the maintopmast on deck and was constructing the shears.&nbsp; Lashing the two topmasts together, and making allowance for their unequal length, at the point of intersection I attached the double block of the main throat-halyards.&nbsp; This, with the single block and the throat-halyards themselves, gave me a hoisting tackle.&nbsp; To prevent the butts of the masts from slipping on the deck, I nailed down thick cleats.&nbsp; Everything in readiness, I made a line fast to the apex of the shears and carried it directly to the windlass.&nbsp; I was growing to have faith in that windlass, for it gave me power beyond all expectation.&nbsp; As usual, Maud held the turn while I heaved.&nbsp; The shears rose in the air.</p>
<p>
	Then I discovered I had forgotten guy-ropes.&nbsp; This necessitated my climbing the shears, which I did twice, before I finished guying it fore and aft and to either side.&nbsp; Twilight had set in by the time this was accomplished.&nbsp; Wolf Larsen, who had sat about and listened all afternoon and never opened his mouth, had taken himself off to the galley and started his supper.&nbsp; I felt quite stiff across the small of the back, so much so that I straightened up with an effort and with pain.&nbsp; I looked proudly at my work.&nbsp; It was beginning to show.&nbsp; I was wild with desire, like a child with a new toy, to hoist something with my shears.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I wish it weren&rsquo;t so late,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see how it works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a glutton, Humphrey,&rdquo; Maud chided me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Remember, to-morrow is coming, and you&rsquo;re so tired now that you can hardly stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; I said, with sudden solicitude.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must be very tired.&nbsp; You have worked hard and nobly.&nbsp; I am proud of you, Maud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Not half so proud as I am of you, nor with half the reason,&rdquo; she answered, looking me straight in the eyes for a moment with an expression in her own and a dancing, tremulous light which I had not seen before and which gave me a pang of quick delight, I know not why, for I did not understand it.&nbsp; Then she dropped her eyes, to lift them again, laughing.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;If our friends could see us now,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at us.&nbsp; Have you ever paused for a moment to consider our appearance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes, I have considered yours, frequently,&rdquo; I answered, puzzling over what I had seen in her eyes and puzzled by her sudden change of subject.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what do I look like, pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A scarecrow, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just glance at your draggled skirts, for instance.&nbsp; Look at those three-cornered tears.&nbsp; And such a waist!&nbsp; It would not require a Sherlock Holmes to deduce that you have been cooking over a camp-fire, to say nothing of trying out seal-blubber.&nbsp; And to cap it all, that cap!&nbsp; And all that is the woman who wrote &lsquo;A Kiss Endured.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She made me an elaborate and stately courtesy, and said, &ldquo;As for you, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	And yet, through the five minutes of banter which followed, there was a serious something underneath the fun which I could not but relate to the strange and fleeting expression I had caught in her eyes.&nbsp; What was it?&nbsp; Could it be that our eyes were speaking beyond the will of our speech?&nbsp; My eyes had spoken, I knew, until I had found the culprits out and silenced them.&nbsp; This had occurred several times.&nbsp; But had she seen the clamour in them and understood?&nbsp; And had her eyes so spoken to me?&nbsp; What else could that expression have meant&mdash;that dancing, tremulous light, and a something more which words could not describe.&nbsp; And yet it could not be.&nbsp; It was impossible.&nbsp; Besides, I was not skilled in the speech of eyes.&nbsp; I was only Humphrey Van Weyden, a bookish fellow who loved.&nbsp; And to love, and to wait and win love, that surely was glorious enough for me.&nbsp; And thus I thought, even as we chaffed each other&rsquo;s appearance, until we arrived ashore and there were other things to think about.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame, after working hard all day, that we cannot have an uninterrupted night&rsquo;s sleep,&rdquo; I complained, after supper.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But there can be no danger now? from a blind man?&rdquo; she queried.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I shall never be able to trust him,&rdquo; I averred, &ldquo;and far less now that he is blind.&nbsp; The liability is that his part helplessness will make him more malignant than ever.&nbsp; I know what I shall do to-morrow, the first thing&mdash;run out a light anchor and kedge the schooner off the beach.&nbsp; And each night when we come ashore in the boat, Mr. Wolf Larsen will be left a prisoner on board.&nbsp; So this will be the last night we have to stand watch, and because of that it will go the easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	We were awake early and just finishing breakfast as daylight came.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, Humphrey!&rdquo; I heard Maud cry in dismay and suddenly stop.</p>
<p>
	I looked at her.&nbsp; She was gazing at the <em>Ghost.</em>&nbsp; I followed her gaze, but could see nothing unusual.&nbsp; She looked at me, and I looked inquiry back.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The shears,&rdquo; she said, and her voice trembled.</p>
<p>
	I had forgotten their existence.&nbsp; I looked again, but could not see them.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;If he has&mdash;&rdquo; I muttered savagely.</p>
<p>
	She put her hand sympathetically on mine, and said, &ldquo;You will have to begin over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, believe me, my anger means nothing; I could not hurt a fly,&rdquo; I smiled back bitterly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the worst of it is, he knows it.&nbsp; You are right.&nbsp; If he has destroyed the shears, I shall do nothing except begin over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll stand my watch on board hereafter,&rdquo; I blurted out a moment later.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if he interferes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But I dare not stay ashore all night alone,&rdquo; Maud was saying when I came back to myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be so much nicer if he would be friendly with us and help us.&nbsp; We could all live comfortably aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; I asserted, still savagely, for the destruction of my beloved shears had hit me hard.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is, you and I will live aboard, friendly or not with Wolf Larsen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s childish,&rdquo; I laughed later, &ldquo;for him to do such things, and for me to grow angry over them, for that matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	But my heart smote me when we climbed aboard and looked at the havoc he had done.&nbsp; The shears were gone altogether.&nbsp; The guys had been slashed right and left.&nbsp; The throat-halyards which I had rigged were cut across through every part.&nbsp; And he knew I could not splice.&nbsp; A thought struck me.&nbsp; I ran to the windlass.&nbsp; It would not work.&nbsp; He had broken it.&nbsp; We looked at each other in consternation.&nbsp; Then I ran to the side.&nbsp; The masts, booms, and gaffs I had cleared were gone.&nbsp; He had found the lines which held them, and cast them adrift.</p>
<p>
	Tears were in Maud&rsquo;s eyes, and I do believe they were for me.&nbsp; I could have wept myself.&nbsp; Where now was our project of remasting the <em>Ghost?</em>&nbsp; He had done his work well.&nbsp; I sat down on the hatch-combing and rested my chin on my hands in black despair.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He deserves to die,&rdquo; I cried out; &ldquo;and God forgive me, I am not man enough to be his executioner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	But Maud was by my side, passing her hand soothingly through my hair as though I were a child, and saying, &ldquo;There, there; it will all come right.&nbsp; We are in the right, and it must come right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I remembered Michelet and leaned my head against her; and truly I became strong again.&nbsp; The blessed woman was an unfailing fount of power to me.&nbsp; What did it matter?&nbsp; Only a set-back, a delay.&nbsp; The tide could not have carried the masts far to seaward, and there had been no wind.&nbsp; It meant merely more work to find them and tow them back.&nbsp; And besides, it was a lesson.&nbsp; I knew what to expect.&nbsp; He might have waited and destroyed our work more effectually when we had more accomplished.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Here he comes now,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>
	I glanced up.&nbsp; He was strolling leisurely along the poop on the port side.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Take no notice of him,&rdquo; I whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming to see how we take it.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let him know that we know.&nbsp; We can deny him that satisfaction.&nbsp; Take off your shoes&mdash;that&rsquo;s right&mdash;and carry them in your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	And then we played hide-and-seek with the blind man.&nbsp; As he came up the port side we slipped past on the starboard; and from the poop we watched him turn and start aft on our track.</p>
<p>
	He must have known, somehow, that we were on board, for he said &ldquo;Good-morning&rdquo; very confidently, and waited, for the greeting to be returned.&nbsp; Then he strolled aft, and we slipped forward.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, I know you&rsquo;re aboard,&rdquo; he called out, and I could see him listen intently after he had spoken.</p>
<p>
	It reminded me of the great hoot-owl, listening, after its booming cry, for the stir of its frightened prey.&nbsp; But we did not fir, and we moved only when he moved.&nbsp; And so we dodged about the deck, hand in hand, like a couple of children chased by a wicked ogre, till Wolf Larsen, evidently in disgust, left the deck for the cabin.&nbsp; There was glee in our eyes, and suppressed titters in our mouths, as we put on our shoes and clambered over the side into the boat.&nbsp; And as I looked into Maud&rsquo;s clear brown eyes I forgot the evil he had done, and I knew only that I loved her, and that because of her the strength was mine to win our way back to the world.</p>
