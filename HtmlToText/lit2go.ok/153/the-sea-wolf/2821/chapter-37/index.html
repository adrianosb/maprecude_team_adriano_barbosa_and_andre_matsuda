                <p>
	At once we moved aboard the <em>Ghost,</em> occupying our old state-rooms and cooking in the galley.&nbsp; The imprisonment of Wolf Larsen had happened most opportunely, for what must have been the Indian summer of this high latitude was gone and drizzling stormy weather had set in.&nbsp; We were very comfortable, and the inadequate shears, with the foremast suspended from them, gave a business-like air to the schooner and a promise of departure.</p>
<p>
	And now that we had Wolf Larsen in irons, how little did we need it!&nbsp; Like his first attack, his second had been accompanied by serious disablement.&nbsp; Maud made the discovery in the afternoon while trying to give him nourishment.&nbsp; He had shown signs of consciousness, and she had spoken to him, eliciting no response.&nbsp; He was lying on his left side at the time, and in evident pain.&nbsp; With a restless movement he rolled his head around, clearing his left ear from the pillow against which it had been pressed.&nbsp; At once he heard and answered her, and at once she came to me.</p>
<p>
	Pressing the pillow against his left ear, I asked him if he heard me, but he gave no sign.&nbsp; Removing the pillow and, repeating the question he answered promptly that he did.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Do you know you are deaf in the right ear?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered in a low, strong voice, &ldquo;and worse than that.&nbsp; My whole right side is affected.&nbsp; It seems asleep.&nbsp; I cannot move arm or leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Feigning again?&rdquo; I demanded angrily.</p>
<p>
	He shook his head, his stern mouth shaping the strangest, twisted smile.&nbsp; It was indeed a twisted smile, for it was on the left side only, the facial muscles of the right side moving not at all.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;That was the last play of the Wolf,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am paralysed.&nbsp; I shall never walk again.&nbsp; Oh, only on the other side,&rdquo; he added, as though divining the suspicious glance I flung at his left leg, the knee of which had just then drawn up, and elevated the blankets.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate,&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d liked to have done for you first, Hump.&nbsp; And I thought I had that much left in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; I asked; partly in horror, partly out of curiosity.</p>
<p>
	Again his stern mouth framed the twisted smile, as he said:</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, just to be alive, to be living and doing, to be the biggest bit of the ferment to the end, to eat you.&nbsp; But to die this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He shrugged his shoulders, or attempted to shrug them, rather, for the left shoulder alone moved.&nbsp; Like the smile, the shrug was twisted.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But how can you account for it?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is the seat of your trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The brain,&rdquo; he said at once.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was those cursed headaches brought it on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Symptoms,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>
	He nodded his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no accounting for it.&nbsp; I was never sick in my life.&nbsp; Something&rsquo;s gone wrong with my brain.&nbsp; A cancer, a tumour, or something of that nature,&mdash;a thing that devours and destroys.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s attacking my nerve-centres, eating them up, bit by bit, cell by cell&mdash;from the pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The motor-centres, too,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So it would seem; and the curse of it is that I must lie here, conscious, mentally unimpaired, knowing that the lines are going down, breaking bit by bit communication with the world.&nbsp; I cannot see, hearing and feeling are leaving me, at this rate I shall soon cease to speak; yet all the time I shall be here, alive, active, and powerless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;When you say <em>you</em> are here, I&rsquo;d suggest the likelihood of the soul,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; was his retort.&nbsp; &ldquo;It simply means that in the attack on my brain the higher psychical centres are untouched.&nbsp; I can remember, I can think and reason.&nbsp; When that goes, I go.&nbsp; I am not.&nbsp; The soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He broke out in mocking laughter, then turned his left ear to the pillow as a sign that he wished no further conversation.</p>
<p>
	Maud and I went about our work oppressed by the fearful fate which had overtaken him,&mdash;how fearful we were yet fully to realize.&nbsp; There was the awfulness of retribution about it.&nbsp; Our thoughts were deep and solemn, and we spoke to each other scarcely above whispers.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You might remove the handcuffs,&rdquo; he said that night, as we stood in consultation over him.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dead safe.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a paralytic now.&nbsp; The next thing to watch out for is bed sores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He smiled his twisted smile, and Maud, her eyes wide with horror, was compelled to turn away her head.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Do you know that your smile is crooked?&rdquo; I asked him; for I knew that she must attend him, and I wished to save her as much as possible.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Then I shall smile no more,&rdquo; he said calmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought something was wrong.&nbsp; My right cheek has been numb all day.&nbsp; Yes, and I&rsquo;ve had warnings of this for the last three days; by spells, my right side seemed going to sleep, sometimes arm or hand, sometimes leg or foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So my smile is crooked?&rdquo; he queried a short while after.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, consider henceforth that I smile internally, with my soul, if you please, my soul.&nbsp; Consider that I am smiling now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	And for the space of several minutes he lay there, quiet, indulging his grotesque fancy.</p>
<p>
	The man of him was not changed.&nbsp; It was the old, indomitable, terrible Wolf Larsen, imprisoned somewhere within that flesh which had once been so invincible and splendid.&nbsp; Now it bound him with insentient fetters, walling his soul in darkness and silence, blocking it from the world which to him had been a riot of action.&nbsp; No more would he conjugate the verb &ldquo;to do in every mood and tense.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To be&rdquo; was all that remained to him&mdash;to be, as he had defined death, without movement; to will, but not to execute; to think and reason and in the spirit of him to be as alive as ever, but in the flesh to be dead, quite dead.</p>
<p>
	And yet, though I even removed the handcuffs, we could not adjust ourselves to his condition.&nbsp; Our minds revolted.&nbsp; To us he was full of potentiality.&nbsp; We knew not what to expect of him next, what fearful thing, rising above the flesh, he might break out and do.&nbsp; Our experience warranted this state of mind, and we went about our work with anxiety always upon us.</p>
<p>
	I had solved the problem which had arisen through the shortness of the shears.&nbsp; By means of the watch-tackle (I had made a new one), I heaved the butt of the foremast across the rail and then lowered it to the deck.&nbsp; Next, by means of the shears, I hoisted the main boom on board.&nbsp; Its forty feet of length would supply the height necessary properly to swing the mast.&nbsp; By means of a secondary tackle I had attached to the shears, I swung the boom to a nearly perpendicular position, then lowered the butt to the deck, where, to prevent slipping, I spiked great cleats around it.&nbsp; The single block of my original shears-tackle I had attached to the end of the boom.&nbsp; Thus, by carrying this tackle to the windlass, I could raise and lower the end of the boom at will, the butt always remaining stationary, and, by means of guys, I could swing the boom from side to side.&nbsp; To the end of the boom I had likewise rigged a hoisting tackle; and when the whole arrangement was completed I could not but be startled by the power and latitude it gave me.</p>
<p>
	Of course, two days&rsquo; work was required for the accomplishment of this part of my task, and it was not till the morning of the third day that I swung the foremast from the deck and proceeded to square its butt to fit the step.&nbsp; Here I was especially awkward.&nbsp; I sawed and chopped and chiselled the weathered wood till it had the appearance of having been gnawed by some gigantic mouse.&nbsp; But it fitted.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It will work, I know it will work,&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Do you know Dr. Jordan&rsquo;s final test of truth?&rdquo; Maud asked.</p>
<p>
	I shook my head and paused in the act of dislodging the shavings which had drifted down my neck.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Can we make it work?&nbsp; Can we trust our lives to it? is the test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He is a favourite of yours,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;When I dismantled my old Pantheon and cast out Napoleon and C&aelig;sar and their fellows, I straightway erected a new Pantheon,&rdquo; she answered gravely, &ldquo;and the first I installed as Dr. Jordan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A modern hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And a greater because modern,&rdquo; she added.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can the Old World heroes compare with ours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I shook my head.&nbsp; We were too much alike in many things for argument.&nbsp; Our points of view and outlook on life at least were very alike.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;For a pair of critics we agree famously,&rdquo; I laughed.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And as shipwright and able assistant,&rdquo; she laughed back.</p>
<p>
	But there was little time for laughter in those days, what of our heavy work and of the awfulness of Wolf Larsen&rsquo;s living death.</p>
<p>
	He had received another stroke.&nbsp; He had lost his voice, or he was losing it.&nbsp; He had only intermittent use of it.&nbsp; As he phrased it, the wires were like the stock market, now up, now down.&nbsp; Occasionally the wires were up and he spoke as well as ever, though slowly and heavily.&nbsp; Then speech would suddenly desert him, in the middle of a sentence perhaps, and for hours, sometimes, we would wait for the connection to be re-established.&nbsp; He complained of great pain in his head, and it was during this period that he arranged a system of communication against the time when speech should leave him altogether&mdash;one pressure of the hand for &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; two for &ldquo;no.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was well that it was arranged, for by evening his voice had gone from him.&nbsp; By hand pressures, after that, he answered our questions, and when he wished to speak he scrawled his thoughts with his left hand, quite legibly, on a sheet of paper.</p>
<p>
	The fierce winter had now descended upon us.&nbsp; Gale followed gale, with snow and sleet and rain.&nbsp; The seals had started on their great southern migration, and the rookery was practically deserted.&nbsp; I worked feverishly.&nbsp; In spite of the bad weather, and of the wind which especially hindered me, I was on deck from daylight till dark and making substantial progress.</p>
<p>
	I profited by my lesson learned through raising the shears and then climbing them to attach the guys.&nbsp; To the top of the foremast, which was just lifted conveniently from the deck, I attached the rigging, stays and throat and peak halyards.&nbsp; As usual, I had underrated the amount of work involved in this portion of the task, and two long days were necessary to complete it.&nbsp; And there was so much yet to be done&mdash;the sails, for instance, which practically had to be made over.</p>
<p>
	While I toiled at rigging the foremast, Maud sewed on canvas, ready always to drop everything and come to my assistance when more hands than two were required.&nbsp; The canvas was heavy and hard, and she sewed with the regular sailor&rsquo;s palm and three-cornered sail-needle.&nbsp; Her hands were soon sadly blistered, but she struggled bravely on, and in addition doing the cooking and taking care of the sick man.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A fig for superstition,&rdquo; I said on Friday morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;That mast goes in to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Everything was ready for the attempt.&nbsp; Carrying the boom-tackle to the windlass, I hoisted the mast nearly clear of the deck.&nbsp; Making this tackle fast, I took to the windlass the shears-tackle (which was connected with the end of the boom), and with a few turns had the mast perpendicular and clear.</p>
<p>
	Maud clapped her hands the instant she was relieved from holding the turn, crying:</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It works!&nbsp; It works!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll trust our lives to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Then she assumed a rueful expression.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not over the hole,&rdquo; she add.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you have to begin all over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I smiled in superior fashion, and, slacking off on one of the boom-guys and taking in on the other, swung the mast perfectly in the centre of the deck.&nbsp; Still it was not over the hole.&nbsp; Again the rueful expression came on her face, and again I smiled in a superior way.&nbsp; Slacking away on the boom-tackle and hoisting an equivalent amount on the shears-tackle, I brought the butt of the mast into position directly over the hole in the deck.&nbsp; Then I gave Maud careful instructions for lowering away and went into the hold to the step on the schooner&rsquo;s bottom.</p>
<p>
	I called to her, and the mast moved easily and accurately.&nbsp; Straight toward the square hole of the step the square butt descended; but as it descended it slowly twisted so that square would not fit into square.&nbsp; But I had not even a moment&rsquo;s indecision.&nbsp; Calling to Maud to cease lowering, I went on deck and made the watch-tackle fast to the mast with a rolling hitch.&nbsp; I left Maud to pull on it while I went below.&nbsp; By the light of the lantern I saw the butt twist slowly around till its sides coincided with the sides of the step.&nbsp; Maud made fast and returned to the windlass.&nbsp; Slowly the butt descended the several intervening inches, at the same time slightly twisting again.&nbsp; Again Maud rectified the twist with the watch-tackle, and again she lowered away from the windlass.&nbsp; Square fitted into square.&nbsp; The mast was stepped.</p>
<p>
	I raised a shout, and she ran down to see.&nbsp; In the yellow lantern light we peered at what we had accomplished.&nbsp; We looked at each other, and our hands felt their way and clasped.&nbsp; The eyes of both of us, I think, were moist with the joy of success.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It was done so easily after all,&rdquo; I remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;All the work was in the preparation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And all the wonder in the completion,&rdquo; Maud added.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can scarcely bring myself to realize that that great mast is really up and in; that you have lifted it from the water, swung it through the air, and deposited it here where it belongs.&nbsp; It is a Titan&rsquo;s task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And they made themselves many inventions,&rdquo; I began merrily, then paused to sniff the air.</p>
<p>
	I looked hastily at the lantern.&nbsp; It was not smoking.&nbsp; Again I sniffed.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Something is burning,&rdquo; Maud said, with sudden conviction.</p>
<p>
	We sprang together for the ladder, but I raced past her to the deck.&nbsp; A dense volume of smoke was pouring out of the steerage companion-way.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The Wolf is not yet dead,&rdquo; I muttered to myself as I sprang down through the smoke.</p>
<p>
	It was so thick in the confined space that I was compelled to feel my way; and so potent was the spell of Wolf Larsen on my imagination, I was quite prepared for the helpless giant to grip my neck in a strangle hold.&nbsp; I hesitated, the desire to race back and up the steps to the deck almost overpowering me.&nbsp; Then I recollected Maud.&nbsp; The vision of her, as I had last seen her, in the lantern light of the schooner&rsquo;s hold, her brown eyes warm and moist with joy, flashed before me, and I knew that I could not go back.</p>
<p>
	I was choking and suffocating by the time I reached Wolf Larsen&rsquo;s bunk.&nbsp; I reached my hand and felt for his.&nbsp; He was lying motionless, but moved slightly at the touch of my hand.&nbsp; I felt over and under his blankets.&nbsp; There was no warmth, no sign of fire.&nbsp; Yet that smoke which blinded me and made me cough and gasp must have a source.&nbsp; I lost my head temporarily and dashed frantically about the steerage.&nbsp; A collision with the table partially knocked the wind from my body and brought me to myself.&nbsp; I reasoned that a helpless man could start a fire only near to where he lay.</p>
<p>
	I returned to Wolf Larsen&rsquo;s bunk.&nbsp; There I encountered Maud.&nbsp; How long she had been there in that suffocating atmosphere I could not guess.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Go up on deck!&rdquo; I commanded peremptorily.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But, Humphrey&mdash;&rdquo; she began to protest in a queer, husky voice.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Please! please!&rdquo; I shouted at her harshly.</p>
<p>
	She drew away obediently, and then I thought, What if she cannot find the steps?&nbsp; I started after her, to stop at the foot of the companion-way.&nbsp; Perhaps she had gone up.&nbsp; As I stood there, hesitant, I heard her cry softly:</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, Humphrey, I am lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I found her fumbling at the wall of the after bulkhead, and, half leading her, half carrying her, I took her up the companion-way.&nbsp; The pure air was like nectar.&nbsp; Maud was only faint and dizzy, and I left her lying on the deck when I took my second plunge below.</p>
<p>
	The source of the smoke must be very close to Wolf Larsen&mdash;my mind was made up to this, and I went straight to his bunk.&nbsp; As I felt about among his blankets, something hot fell on the back of my hand.&nbsp; It burned me, and I jerked my hand away.&nbsp; Then I understood.&nbsp; Through the cracks in the bottom of the upper bunk he had set fire to the mattress.&nbsp; He still retained sufficient use of his left arm to do this.&nbsp; The damp straw of the mattress, fired from beneath and denied air, had been smouldering all the while.</p>
<p>
	As I dragged the mattress out of the bunk it seemed to disintegrate in mid-air, at the same time bursting into flames.&nbsp; I beat out the burning remnants of straw in the bunk, then made a dash for the deck for fresh air.</p>
<p>
	Several buckets of water sufficed to put out the burning mattress in the middle of the steerage floor; and ten minutes later, when the smoke had fairly cleared, I allowed Maud to come below.&nbsp; Wolf Larsen was unconscious, but it was a matter of minutes for the fresh air to restore him.&nbsp; We were working over him, however, when he signed for paper and pencil.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Pray do not interrupt me,&rdquo; he wrote.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am smiling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I am still a bit of the ferment, you see,&rdquo; he wrote a little later.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I am glad you are as small a bit as you are,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he wrote.&nbsp; &ldquo;But just think of how much smaller I shall be before I die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And yet I am all here, Hump,&rdquo; he wrote with a final flourish.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can think more clearly than ever in my life before.&nbsp; Nothing to disturb me.&nbsp; Concentration is perfect.&nbsp; I am all here and more than here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	It was like a message from the night of the grave; for this man&rsquo;s body had become his mausoleum.&nbsp; And there, in so strange sepulchre, his spirit fluttered and lived.&nbsp; It would flutter and live till the last line of communication was broken, and after that who was to say how much longer it might continue to flutter and live?</p>
