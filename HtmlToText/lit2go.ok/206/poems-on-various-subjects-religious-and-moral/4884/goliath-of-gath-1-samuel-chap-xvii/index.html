	YE martial pow&#39;rs, and all ye tuneful nine,<br />
	Inspire my song, and aid my high design.<br />
	The dreadful scenes and toils of war I write,<br />
	The ardent warriors, and the fields of fight:<br />
	You best remember, and you best can sing<br />
	The acts of heroes to the vocal string:<br />
	Resume the lays with which your sacred lyre,<br />
	Did then the poet and the sage inspire.<br />
	Now front to front the armies were display&#39;d,<br />
	Here Israel rang&#39;d, and there the foes array&#39;d;<br />
	The hosts on two opposing mountains stood,<br />
	Thick as the foliage of the waving wood;<br />
	Between them an extensive valley lay,<br />
	O&#39;er which the gleaming armour pour&#39;d the day,<br />
	When from the camp of the Philistine foes,<br />
	Dreadful to view, a mighty warrior rose;<br />
	In the dire deeds of bleeding battle skill&#39;d,<br />
	The monster stalks the terror of the field.<br />
	From Gath he sprung, Goliath was his name,<br />
	Of fierce deportment, and gigantic frame:<br />
	A brazen helmet on his head was plac&#39;d,<br />
	A coat of mail his form terrific grac&#39;d,<br />
	The greaves his legs, the targe his shoulders prest:<br />
	Dreadful in arms high&ndash;tow&#39;ring o&#39;er the rest<br />
	A spear he proudly wav&#39;d, whose iron head,<br />
	Strange to relate, six hundred shekels weigh&#39;d;<br />
	He strode along, and shook the ample field,<br />
	While Phoebus blaz&#39;d refulgent on his shield:<br />
	Through Jacob&#39;s race a chilling horror ran,<br />
	When thus the huge, enormous chief began:<br />
	&quot;Say, what the cause that in this proud array<br />
	&quot;You set your battle in the face of day?<br />
	&quot;One hero find in all your vaunting train,<br />
	&quot;Then see who loses, and who wins the plain;<br />
	&quot;For he who wins, in triumph may demand<br />
	&quot;Perpetual service from the vanquish&#39;d land:<br />
	&quot;Your armies I defy, your force despise,<br />
	&quot;By far inferior in Philistia&#39;s eyes:<br />
	&quot;Produce a man, and let us try the fight,<br />
	&quot;Decide the contest, and the victor&#39;s right.&quot;<br />
	Thus challeng&#39;d he: all Israel stood amaz&#39;d,<br />
	And ev&#39;ry chief in consternation gaz&#39;d;<br />
	But Jesse&#39;s son in youthful bloom appears,<br />
	And warlike courage far beyond his years:<br />
	He left the folds, he left the flow&#39;ry meads,<br />
	And soft recesses of the sylvan shades.<br />
	Now Israel&#39;s monarch, and his troops arise,<br />
	With peals of shouts ascending to the skies;<br />
	In Elah&#39;s vale the scene of combat lies.<br />
	When the fair morning blush&#39;d with orient red,<br />
	What David&#39;s fire enjoin&#39;d the son obey&#39;d,<br />
	And swift of foot towards the trench he came,<br />
	Where glow&#39;d each bosom with the martial flame.<br />
	He leaves his carriage to another&#39;s care,<br />
	And runs to greet his brethren of the war.<br />
	While yet they spake the giant&ndash;chief arose,<br />
	Repeats the challenge, and insults his foes:<br />
	Struck with the sound, and trembling at the view,<br />
	Affrighted Israel from its post withdrew.<br />
	&quot;Observe ye this tremendous foe, they cry&#39;d,<br />
	&quot;Who in proud vaunts our armies hath defy&#39;d:<br />
	&quot;Whoever lays him prostrate on the plain,<br />
	&quot;Freedom in Israel for his house shall gain;<br />
	&quot;And on him wealth unknown the king will pour,<br />
	&quot;And give his royal daughter for his dow&#39;r.&quot;<br />
	Then Jesse&#39;s youngest hope: &quot;My brethren say,<br />
	&quot;What shall be done for him who takes away<br />
	&quot;Reproach from Jacob, who destroys the chief.<br />
	&quot;And puts a period to his country&#39;s grief.<br />
	&quot;He vaunts the honours of his arms abroad,<br />
	&quot;And scorns the armies of the living God.&quot;<br />
	Thus spoke the youth, th&#39; attentive people ey&#39;d<br />
	The wond&#39;rous hero, and again reply&#39;d:<br />
	&quot;Such the rewards our monarch will bestow,<br />
	&quot;On him who conquers, and destroys his foe.&quot;<br />
	Eliab heard, and kindled into ire<br />
	To hear his shepherd brother thus inquire,<br />
	And thus begun: &quot;What errand brought thee? say<br />
	&quot;Who keeps thy flock? or does it go astray?<br />
	&quot;I know the base ambition of thine heart,<br />
	&quot;But back in safety from the field depart.&quot;<br />
	Eliab thus to Jesse&#39;s youngest heir,<br />
	Express&#39;d his wrath in accents most severe.<br />
	When to his brother mildly he reply&#39;d.<br />
	&quot;What have I done? or what the cause to chide?<br />
	The words were told before the king, who sent<br />
	For the young hero to his royal tent:<br />
	Before the monarch dauntless he began,<br />
	&quot;For this Philistine fail no heart of man:<br />
	&quot;I&#39;ll take the vale, and with the giant fight:<br />
	&quot;I dread not all his boasts, nor all his might.&quot;<br />
	When thus the king: &quot;Dar&#39;st thou a stripling go,<br />
	&quot;And venture combat with so great a foe?<br />
	&quot;Who all his days has been inur&#39;d to fight,<br />
	&quot;And made its deeds his study and delight:<br />
	&quot;Battles and bloodshed brought the monster forth,<br />
	&quot;And clouds and whirlwinds usher&#39;d in his birth.&quot;<br />
	When David thus: &quot;I kept the fleecy care,<br />
	&quot;And out there rush&#39;d a lion and a bear;<br />
	&quot;A tender lamb the hungry lion took,<br />
	&quot;And with no other weapon than my crook<br />
	&quot;Bold I pursu&#39;d, and chas d him o&#39;er the field,<br />
	&quot;The prey deliver&#39;d, and the felon kill&#39;d:<br />
	&quot;As thus the lion and the bear I slew,<br />
	&quot;So shall Goliath fall, and all his crew:<br />
	&quot;The God, who sav&#39;d me from these beasts of prey,<br />
	&quot;By me this monster in the dust shall lay.&quot;<br />
	So David spoke. The wond&#39;ring king reply&#39;d;<br />
	&quot;Go thou with heav&#39;n and victory on thy side:<br />
	&quot;This coat of mail, this sword gird on,&quot; he said,<br />
	And plac&#39;d a mighty helmet on his head:<br />
	The coat, the sword, the helm he laid aside,<br />
	Nor chose to venture with those arms untry&#39;d,<br />
	Then took his staff, and to the neighb&#39;ring brook<br />
	Instant he ran, and thence five pebbles took.<br />
	Mean time descended to Philistia&#39;s son<br />
	A radiant cherub, and he thus begun:<br />
	&quot;Goliath, well thou know&#39;st thou hast defy&#39;d<br />
	&quot;Yon Hebrew armies, and their God deny&#39;d:<br />
	&quot;Rebellious wretch! audacious worm! forbear,<br />
	&quot;Nor tempt the vengeance of their God too far:<br />
	&quot;Them, who with his Omnipotence contend,<br />
	&quot;No eye shall pity, and no arm defend:<br />
	&quot;Proud as thou art, in short liv&#39;d glory great,<br />
	&quot;I come to tell thee thine approaching fate.<br />
	&quot;Regard my words. The Judge of all the gods,<br />
	&quot;Beneath whose steps the tow&#39;ring mountain nods,<br />
	&quot;Will give thine armies to the savage brood,<br />
	&quot;That cut the liquid air, or range the wood.<br />
	&quot;Thee too a well&ndash;aim&#39;d pebble shall destroy,<br />
	&quot;And thou shalt perish by a beardless boy:<br />
	&quot;Such is the mandate from the realms above,<br />
	&quot;And should I try the vengeance to remove,<br />
	&quot;Myself a rebel to my king would prove.<br />
	&quot;Goliath say, shall grace to him be shown,<br />
	&quot;Who dares heav&#39;ns Monarch, and insults his throne?&quot;<br />
	&quot;Your words are lost on me,&quot; the giant cries,<br />
	While fear and wrath contended in his eyes,<br />
	When thus the messenger from heav&#39;n replies:<br />
	&quot;Provoke no more Jehovah&#39;s awful hand<br />
	&quot;To hurl its vengeance on thy guilty land:<br />
	&quot;He grasps the thunder, and, he wings the storm,<br />
	&quot;Servants their sov&#39;reign&#39;s orders to perform.&quot;<br />
	The angel spoke, and turn&#39;d his eyes away,<br />
	Adding new radiance to the rising day.<br />
	Now David comes: the fatal stones demand<br />
	His left, the staff engag&#39;d his better hand:<br />
	The giant mov&#39;d, and from his tow&#39;ring height<br />
	Survey&#39;d the stripling, and disdain&#39;d the fight,<br />
	And thus began: &quot;Am I a dog with thee?<br />
	&quot;Bring&#39;st thou no armour, but a staff to me?<br />
	&quot;The gods on thee their vollied curses pour,<br />
	&quot;And beasts and birds of prey thy flesh devour.&quot;<br />
	David undaunted thus, &quot;Thy spear and shield<br />
	&quot;Shall no protection to thy body yield:<br />
	&quot;Jehovah&#39;s name&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;no other arms I bear,<br />
	&quot;I ask no other in this glorious war.<br />
	&quot;To&ndash;day the Lord of Hosts to me will give<br />
	&quot;Vict&#39;ry, to&ndash;day thy doom thou shalt receive;<br />
	&quot;The fate you threaten shall your own become,<br />
	&quot;And beasts shall be your animated tomb,<br />
	&quot;That all the earth&#39;s inhabitants may know<br />
	&quot;That there&#39;s a God, who governs all below:<br />
	&quot;This great assembly too shall witness stand,<br />
	&quot;That needs nor sword, nor spear, th&#39; Almighty&#39;s<br />
	hand:<br />
	&quot;The battle his, the conquest he bestows,<br />
	&quot;And to our pow&#39;r consigns our hated foes.&quot;<br />
	Thus David spoke; Goliath heard and came<br />
	To meet the hero in the field of fame.<br />
	Ah! fatal meeting to thy troops and thee,<br />
	But thou wast deaf to the divine decree;<br />
	Young David meets thee, meets thee not in vain;<br />
	&#39;Tis thine to perish on th&#39; ensanguin&#39;d plain.<br />
	And now the youth the forceful pebble slung<br />
	Philistia trembled as it whizz&#39;d along:<br />
	In his dread forehead, where the helmet ends,<br />
	Just o&#39;er the brows the well&ndash;aim&#39;d stone descends,<br />
	It pierc&#39;d the skull, and shatter&#39;d all the brain,<br />
	Prone on his face he tumbled to the plain:<br />
	Goliath&#39;s fall no smaller terror yields<br />
	Than riving thunders in aerial fields:<br />
	The soul still ling&#39;red in its lov&#39;d abode,<br />
	Till conq&#39;ring David o&#39;er the giant strode:<br />
	Goliath&#39;s sword then laid its master dead,<br />
	And from the body hew&#39;d the ghastly head;<br />
	The blood in gushing torrents drench&#39;d the plains,<br />
	The soul found passage through the spouting veins.<br />
	And now aloud th&#39; illustrious victor said,<br />
	&quot;Where are your boastings now your champion&#39;s<br />
	&quot;dead?&quot;<br />
	Scarce had he spoke, when the Philistines fled:<br />
	But fled in vain; the conqu&#39;ror swift pursu&#39;d:<br />
	What scenes of slaughter! and what seas of blood!<br />
	There Saul thy thousands grasp&#39;d th&#39; impurpled sand<br />
	In pangs of death the conquest of thine hand;<br />
	And David there were thy ten thousands laid:<br />
	Thus Israel&#39;s damsels musically play&#39;d.<br />
	Near Gath and Edron many an hero lay,<br />
	Breath&#39;d out their souls, and curs&#39;d the light of day:<br />
	Their fury, quench&#39;d by death, no longer burns,<br />
	And David with Goliath&#39;s head returns,<br />
	To Salem brought, but in his tent he plac&#39;d<br />
	The load of armour which the giant grac&#39;d.<br />
	His monarch saw him coming from the war,<br />
	And thus demanded of the son of Ner.<br />
	&quot;Say, who is this amazing youth?&quot; he cry&#39;d,<br />
	When thus the leader of the host reply&#39;d;<br />
	&quot;As lives thy soul I know not whence he sprung,<br />
	&quot;So great in prowess though in years so young:&quot;<br />
	&quot;Inquire whose son is he,&quot; the sov&#39;reign said,<br />
	&quot;Before whose conq&#39;ring arm Philistia fled.&quot;<br />
	Before the king behold the stripling stand,<br />
	Goliath&#39;s head depending from his hand:<br />
	To him the king: &quot;Say of what martial line<br />
	&quot;Art thou, young hero, and what sire was thine?&quot;<br />
	He humbly thus; &quot;The son of Jesse I:<br />
	&quot;I came the glories of the field to try.<br />
	&quot;Small is my tribe, but valiant in the fight;<br />
	&quot;Small is my city, but thy royal right.&quot;<br />
	&quot;Then take the promis&#39;d gifts,&quot; the monarch cry&#39;d,<br />
	Conferring riches and the royal bride:<br />
	&quot;Knit to my soul for ever thou remain<br />
	&quot;With me, nor quit my regal roof again.&quot;</p>
