	SCENE II. The same. A public place.</p>
<p>
	[Enter, in procession, with music, Caesar; Antony, for the<br />
	course; Calpurnia, Portia, Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, and<br />
	Casca; a great crowd following, among them a Soothsayer.]</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	Calpurnia,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.</p>
<p>
	[Music ceases.]</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	Calpurnia,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	CALPURNIA.<br />
	Here, my lord.</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	Stand you directly in Antonius&rsquo; way,<br />
	When he doth run his course.&mdash;Antonius,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Caesar, my lord?</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	Forget not in your speed, Antonius,<br />
	To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,<br />
	The barren, touched in this holy chase,<br />
	Shake off their sterile curse.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	I shall remember.<br />
	When Caesar says &ldquo;Do this,&rdquo; it is perform&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	Set on; and leave no ceremony out.</p>
<p>
	[Music.]</p>
<p>
	SOOTHSAYER.<br />
	Caesar!</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	Ha! Who calls?</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Bid every noise be still.&mdash;Peace yet again!</p>
<p>
	[Music ceases.]</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	Who is it in the press that calls on me?<br />
	I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,<br />
	Cry &ldquo;Caesar&rdquo;! Speak, Caesar is turn&rsquo;d to hear.</p>
<p>
	SOOTHSAYER.<br />
	Beware the Ides of March.</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	What man is that?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	A soothsayer bids you beware the Ides of March.</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	Set him before me; let me see his face.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	What say&rsquo;st thou to me now? Speak once again.</p>
<p>
	SOOTHSAYER.<br />
	Beware the Ides of March.</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	He is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass.</p>
<p>
	[Sennet. Exeunt all but BRUTUS and CASSIUS.]</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Will you go see the order of the course?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Not I.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	I pray you, do.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	I am not gamesome; I do lack some part<br />
	Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.<br />
	Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;<br />
	I&rsquo;ll leave you.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Brutus, I do observe you now of late:<br />
	I have not from your eyes that gentleness<br />
	And show of love as I was wont to have:<br />
	You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand<br />
	Over your friend that loves you.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Cassius,<br />
	Be not deceived: if I have veil&rsquo;d my look,<br />
	I turn the trouble of my countenance<br />
	Merely upon myself. Vexed I am<br />
	Of late with passions of some difference,<br />
	Conceptions only proper to myself,<br />
	Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;<br />
	But let not therefore my good friends be grieved&mdash;<br />
	Among which number, Cassius, be you one&mdash;<br />
	Nor construe any further my neglect,<br />
	Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,<br />
	Forgets the shows of love to other men.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;<br />
	By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried<br />
	Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.<br />
	Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself<br />
	But by reflection, by some other thing.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	&lsquo;Tis just:<br />
	And it is very much lamented, Brutus,<br />
	That you have no such mirrors as will turn<br />
	Your hidden worthiness into your eye,<br />
	That you might see your shadow. I have heard<br />
	Where many of the best respect in Rome,&mdash;<br />
	Except immortal Caesar!&mdash; speaking of Brutus,<br />
	And groaning underneath this age&rsquo;s yoke,<br />
	Have wish&rsquo;d that noble Brutus had his eyes.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,<br />
	That you would have me seek into myself<br />
	For that which is not in me?</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear;<br />
	And since you know you cannot see yourself<br />
	So well as by reflection, I, your glass,<br />
	Will modestly discover to yourself<br />
	That of yourself which you yet know not of.<br />
	And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus;<br />
	Were I a common laugher, or did use<br />
	To stale with ordinary oaths my love<br />
	To every new protester; if you know<br />
	That I do fawn on men, and hug them hard<br />
	And after scandal them; or if you know<br />
	That I profess myself, in banqueting,<br />
	To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</p>
<p>
	[Flourish and shout.]</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	What means this shouting? I do fear the people<br />
	Choose Caesar for their king.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Ay, do you fear it?<br />
	Then must I think you would not have it so.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well,<br />
	But wherefore do you hold me here so long?<br />
	What is it that you would impart to me?<br />
	If it be aught toward the general good,<br />
	Set honor in one eye and death i&rsquo; the other<br />
	And I will look on both indifferently;<br />
	For let the gods so speed me as I love<br />
	The name of honor more than I fear death.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,<br />
	As well as I do know your outward favor.<br />
	Well, honor is the subject of my story.<br />
	I cannot tell what you and other men<br />
	Think of this life; but, for my single self,<br />
	I had as lief not be as live to be<br />
	In awe of such a thing as I myself.<br />
	I was born free as Caesar; so were you:<br />
	We both have fed as well; and we can both<br />
	Endure the winter&rsquo;s cold as well as he:<br />
	For once, upon a raw and gusty day,<br />
	The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,<br />
	Caesar said to me, &ldquo;Darest thou, Cassius, now<br />
	Leap in with me into this angry flood<br />
	And swim to yonder point?&rdquo; Upon the word,<br />
	Accoutred as I was, I plunged in,<br />
	And bade him follow: so indeed he did.<br />
	The torrent roar&rsquo;d, and we did buffet it<br />
	With lusty sinews, throwing it aside<br />
	And stemming it with hearts of controversy;<br />
	But ere we could arrive the point proposed,<br />
	Caesar cried, &ldquo;Help me, Cassius, or I sink!<br />
	I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,<br />
	Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder<br />
	The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber<br />
	Did I the tired Caesar: and this man<br />
	Is now become a god; and Cassius is<br />
	A wretched creature, and must bend his body,<br />
	If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.<br />
	He had a fever when he was in Spain;<br />
	And when the fit was on him I did mark<br />
	How he did shake: &lsquo;tis true, this god did shake:<br />
	His coward lips did from their color fly;<br />
	And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world<br />
	Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan:<br />
	Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans<br />
	Mark him, and write his speeches in their books,<br />
	Alas, it cried, &ldquo;Give me some drink, Titinius,&rdquo;<br />
	As a sick girl.&mdash;Ye gods, it doth amaze me,<br />
	A man of such a feeble temper should<br />
	So get the start of the majestic world,<br />
	And bear the palm alone.</p>
<p>
	[Shout. Flourish.]</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Another general shout!<br />
	I do believe that these applauses are<br />
	For some new honors that are heap&rsquo;d on Caesar.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world<br />
	Like a Colossus; and we petty men<br />
	Walk under his huge legs and peep about<br />
	To find ourselves dishonorable graves.<br />
	Men at some time are masters of their fates:<br />
	The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,<br />
	But in ourselves,that we are underlings.<br />
	&ldquo;Brutus&rdquo; and &ldquo;Caesar&rdquo;: what should be in that &ldquo;Caesar&rdquo;?<br />
	Why should that name be sounded more than yours?<br />
	Write them together, yours is as fair a name;<br />
	Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;<br />
	Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with them,<br />
	&ldquo;Brutus&rdquo; will start a spirit as soon as &ldquo;Caesar.&rdquo;<br />
	Now, in the names of all the gods at once,<br />
	Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed<br />
	That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!<br />
	Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!<br />
	When went there by an age since the great flood,<br />
	But it was famed with more than with one man?<br />
	When could they say, till now, that talk&rsquo;d of Rome,<br />
	That her wide walls encompass&rsquo;d but one man?<br />
	Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,<br />
	When there is in it but one only man.<br />
	O, you and I have heard our fathers say<br />
	There was a Brutus once that would have brook&rsquo;d<br />
	Th&rsquo; eternal devil to keep his state in Rome,<br />
	As easily as a king!</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;<br />
	What you would work me to, I have some aim:<br />
	How I have thought of this, and of these times,<br />
	I shall recount hereafter; for this present,<br />
	I would not, so with love I might entreat you,<br />
	Be any further moved. What you have said,<br />
	I will consider; what you have to say,<br />
	I will with patience hear; and find a time<br />
	Both meet to hear and answer such high things.<br />
	Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:<br />
	Brutus had rather be a villager<br />
	Than to repute himself a son of Rome<br />
	Under these hard conditions as this time<br />
	Is like to lay upon us.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	I am glad that my weak words<br />
	Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	The games are done, and Caesar is returning.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;<br />
	And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you<br />
	What hath proceeded worthy note today.</p>
<p>
	[Re-enter Caesar and his Train.]</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	I will do so.&mdash;But, look you, Cassius,<br />
	The angry spot doth glow on Caesar&rsquo;s brow,<br />
	And all the rest look like a chidden train:<br />
	Calpurnia&rsquo;s cheek is pale; and Cicero<br />
	Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes<br />
	As we have seen him in the Capitol,<br />
	Being cross&rsquo;d in conference by some senators.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Casca will tell us what the matter is.</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	Antonius,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Caesar?</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	Let me have men about me that are fat;<br />
	Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o&rsquo; nights:<br />
	Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;<br />
	He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Fear him not, Caesar; he&rsquo;s not dangerous;<br />
	He is a noble Roman and well given.</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:<br />
	Yet, if my name were liable to fear,<br />
	I do not know the man I should avoid<br />
	So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;<br />
	He is a great observer, and he looks<br />
	Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,<br />
	As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music:<br />
	Seldom he smiles; and smiles in such a sort<br />
	As if he mock&rsquo;d himself and scorn&rsquo;d his spirit<br />
	That could be moved to smile at any thing.<br />
	Such men as he be never at heart&rsquo;s ease<br />
	Whiles they behold a greater than themselves;<br />
	And therefore are they very dangerous.<br />
	I rather tell thee what is to be fear&rsquo;d<br />
	Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar.<br />
	Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,<br />
	And tell me truly what thou think&rsquo;st of him.</p>
<p>
	[Exeunt Caesar and his Train. Casca stays.]</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	You pull&rsquo;d me by the cloak; would you speak with me?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today,<br />
	That Caesar looks so sad.</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Why, you were with him, were you not?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Why, there was a crown offer&rsquo;d him; and being offer&rsquo;d him,<br />
	he put it by with the back of his hand, thus; and then the<br />
	people fell a-shouting.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	What was the second noise for?</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Why, for that too.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Why, for that too.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Was the crown offer&rsquo;d him thrice?</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Ay, marry, was&rsquo;t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler<br />
	than other; and at every putting-by mine honest neighbors<br />
	shouted.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Who offer&rsquo;d him the crown?</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Why, Antony.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	I can as well be hang&rsquo;d, as tell the manner of it: it was<br />
	mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a<br />
	crown;&mdash;yet &lsquo;twas not a crown neither, &lsquo;twas one of these<br />
	coronets;&mdash;and, as I told you, he put it by once: but, for all<br />
	that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he<br />
	offered it to him again: then he put it by again: but, to my<br />
	thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then<br />
	he offered it the third time; he put it the third time by; and<br />
	still, as he refused it, the rabblement shouted, and clapp&rsquo;d<br />
	their chopt hands, and threw up their sweaty night-caps, and<br />
	uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused<br />
	the crown, that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swooned and<br />
	fell down at it: and for mine own part, I durst not laugh for<br />
	fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	But, soft! I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	He fell down in the market-place, and foam&rsquo;d at mouth, and was<br />
	speechless.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	&lsquo;Tis very like: he hath the falling-sickness.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	No, Caesar hath it not; but you, and I,<br />
	And honest Casca, we have the falling-sickness.</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	I know not what you mean by that; but I am sure Caesar fell<br />
	down. If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him,<br />
	according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do<br />
	the players in the theatre, I am no true man.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	What said he when he came unto himself?</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common<br />
	herd was glad he refused the crown, he pluck&rsquo;d me ope his<br />
	doublet, and offered them his throat to cut: an I had been a<br />
	man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,<br />
	I would I might go to hell among the rogues:&mdash;and so he fell.<br />
	When he came to himself again, he said, if he had done or said<br />
	any thing amiss, he desired their worships to think it was his<br />
	infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried, &ldquo;Alas,<br />
	good soul!&rdquo; and forgave him with all their hearts. But there&rsquo;s<br />
	no heed to be taken of them: if Caesar had stabb&rsquo;d their<br />
	mothers, they would have done no less.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	And, after that he came, thus sad away?</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Ay.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Did Cicero say any thing?</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Ay, he spoke Greek.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	To what effect?</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Nay, an I tell you that, I&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er look you i&rsquo; the face<br />
	again: but those that understood him smiled at one another and<br />
	shook their heads; but for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I<br />
	could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling<br />
	scarfs off Caesar&rsquo;s images, are put to silence. Fare you well.<br />
	There was more foolery yet, if could remember it.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	No, I am promised forth.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Will you dine with me tomorrow?</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth<br />
	the eating.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Good; I will expect you.</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Do so; farewell both.</p>
<p>
	[Exit CASCA.]</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!<br />
	He was quick mettle when he went to school.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	So is he now in execution<br />
	Of any bold or noble enterprise,<br />
	However he puts on this tardy form.<br />
	This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,<br />
	Which gives men stomach to digest his words<br />
	With better appetite.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	And so it is. For this time I will leave you:<br />
	Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,<br />
	I will come home to you; or, if you will,<br />
	Come home to me, and I will wait for you.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	I will do so: till then, think of the world.&mdash;</p>
<p>
	[Exit Brutus.]</p>
<p>
	Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,<br />
	Thy honorable metal may be wrought,<br />
	From that it is disposed: therefore &lsquo;tis meet<br />
	That noble minds keep ever with their likes;<br />
	For who so firm that cannot be seduced?<br />
	Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus;<br />
	If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,<br />
	He should not humor me. I will this night,<br />
	In several hands, in at his windows throw,<br />
	As if they came from several citizens,<br />
	Writings all tending to the great opinion<br />
	That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely<br />
	Caesar&rsquo;s ambition shall be glanced at:<br />
	And after this let Caesar seat him sure;<br />
	For we will shake him, or worse days endure.</p>
<p>
	[Exit.]</p>
