	ACT III.</p>
<p>
	SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting.</p>
<p>
	[A crowd of people in the street leading to the Capitol, among<br />
	them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer. Flourish. Enter Caesar,<br />
	Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Metellus, Trebonius, Cinna,<br />
	Antony, Lepidus, Popilius, Publius, and others.]</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	The Ides of March are come.</p>
<p>
	SOOTHSAYER.<br />
	Ay, Caesar; but not gone.</p>
<p>
	ARTEMIDORUS.<br />
	Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.</p>
<p>
	DECIUS.<br />
	Trebonius doth desire you to o&rsquo;er-read,<br />
	At your best leisure, this his humble suit.</p>
<p>
	ARTEMIDORUS.<br />
	O Caesar, read mine first; for mine&rsquo;s a suit<br />
	That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	What touches us ourself shall be last served.</p>
<p>
	ARTEMIDORUS.<br />
	Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	What, is the fellow mad?</p>
<p>
	PUBLIUS.<br />
	Sirrah, give place.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	What, urge you your petitions in the street?<br />
	Come to the Capitol.</p>
<p>
	[Caesar enters the Capitol, the rest following. All the Senators<br />
	rise.]</p>
<p>
	POPILIUS.<br />
	I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	What enterprise, Popilius?</p>
<p>
	POPILIUS.<br />
	Fare you well.<br />
	Advances to Caesar.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	What said Popilius Lena?</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	He wish&rsquo;d to-day our enterprise might thrive.<br />
	I fear our purpose is discovered.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Look, how he makes to Caesar: mark him.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.&mdash;<br />
	Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,<br />
	Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,<br />
	For I will slay myself.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Cassius, be constant:<br />
	Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;<br />
	For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Trebonius knows his time, for, look you, Brutus,<br />
	He draws Mark Antony out of the way.</p>
<p>
	[Exeunt Antony and Trebonius. Caesar and the Senators take their<br />
	seats.]</p>
<p>
	DECIUS.<br />
	Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,<br />
	And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	He is address&rsquo;d; press near and second him.</p>
<p>
	CINNA.<br />
	Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Are we all ready?</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	What is now amiss<br />
	That Caesar and his Senate must redress?</p>
<p>
	METELLUS.<br />
	Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,<br />
	Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat<br />
	An humble heart.</p>
<p>
	[Kneeling.]</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	I must prevent thee, Cimber.<br />
	These couchings and these lowly courtesies<br />
	Might fire the blood of ordinary men,<br />
	And turn pre-ordinance and first decree<br />
	Into the law of children. Be not fond,<br />
	To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood<br />
	That will be thaw&rsquo;d from the true quality<br />
	With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,<br />
	Low-crooked curtsies, and base spaniel-fawning.<br />
	Thy brother by decree is banished:<br />
	If thou dost bend, and pray, and fawn for him,<br />
	I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.</p>
<p>
	METELLUS.<br />
	Caesar, thou dost me wrong.</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	Caesar did never wrong but with just cause,<br />
	Nor without cause will he be satisfied.</p>
<p>
	METELLUS.<br />
	Is there no voice more worthy than my own,<br />
	To sound more sweetly in great Caesar&rsquo;s ear<br />
	For the repealing of my banish&rsquo;d brother?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;<br />
	Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may<br />
	Have an immediate freedom of repeal.</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	What, Brutus?</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:<br />
	As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,<br />
	To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	I could be well moved, if I were as you;<br />
	If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:<br />
	But I am constant as the northern star,<br />
	Of whose true-fix&rsquo;d and resting quality<br />
	There is no fellow in the firmament.<br />
	The skies are painted with unnumber&rsquo;d sparks,<br />
	They are all fire, and every one doth shine;<br />
	But there&rsquo;s but one in all doth hold his place:<br />
	So in the world; &lsquo;tis furnish&rsquo;d well with men,<br />
	And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;<br />
	Yet in the number I do know but one<br />
	That unassailable holds on his rank,<br />
	Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,<br />
	Let me a little show it, even in this,&mdash;<br />
	That I was constant Cimber should be banish&rsquo;d,<br />
	And constant do remain to keep him so.</p>
<p>
	CINNA.<br />
	O Caesar,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?</p>
<p>
	DECIUS.<br />
	Great Caesar,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Speak, hands, for me!</p>
<p>
	[Casca stabs Caesar in the neck. Caesar catches hold of his arm.<br />
	He is then stabbed by several other Conspirators, and at last by<br />
	Marcus Brutus.]</p>
<p>
	CAESAR.<br />
	Et tu, Brute?&mdash; Then fall, Caesar!</p>
<p>
	[Dies. The Senators and People retire in confusion.]</p>
<p>
	CINNA.<br />
	Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!&mdash;<br />
	Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Some to the common pulpits and cry out,<br />
	&ldquo;Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	People and Senators, be not affrighted;<br />
	Fly not; stand still; ambition&rsquo;s debt is paid.</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Go to the pulpit, Brutus.</p>
<p>
	DECIUS.<br />
	And Cassius too.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Where&rsquo;s Publius?</p>
<p>
	CINNA.<br />
	Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.</p>
<p>
	METELLUS.<br />
	Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar&rsquo;s<br />
	Should chance&mdash;</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Talk not of standing.&mdash;Publius, good cheer!<br />
	There is no harm intended to your person,<br />
	Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	And leave us, Publius; lest that the people<br />
	Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Do so;&mdash;and let no man abide this deed<br />
	But we the doers.</p>
<p>
	[Re-enter Trebonius.]</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Where&rsquo;s Antony?</p>
<p>
	TREBONIUS.<br />
	Fled to his house amazed.<br />
	Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run,<br />
	As it were doomsday.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Fates, we will know your pleasures:<br />
	That we shall die, we know; &lsquo;tis but the time<br />
	And drawing days out, that men stand upon.</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life<br />
	Cuts off so many years of fearing death.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Grant that, and then is death a benefit:<br />
	So are we Caesar&rsquo;s friends, that have abridged<br />
	His time of fearing death.&mdash;Stoop, Romans, stoop,<br />
	And let us bathe our hands in Caesar&rsquo;s blood<br />
	Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:<br />
	Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,<br />
	And waving our red weapons o&rsquo;er our heads,<br />
	Let&rsquo;s all cry, &ldquo;Peace, freedom, and liberty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence<br />
	Shall this our lofty scene be acted o&rsquo;er<br />
	In States unborn and accents yet unknown!</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,<br />
	That now on Pompey&rsquo;s basis lies along<br />
	No worthier than the dust!</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	So oft as that shall be,<br />
	So often shall the knot of us be call&rsquo;d<br />
	The men that gave their country liberty.</p>
<p>
	DECIUS.<br />
	What, shall we forth?</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Ay, every man away:<br />
	Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels<br />
	With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Soft, who comes here?</p>
<p>
	[Enter a Servant.]</p>
<p>
	A friend of Antony&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>
	SERVANT.<br />
	Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel;<br />
	Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;<br />
	And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:<br />
	Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;<br />
	Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving;<br />
	Say I love Brutus and I honor him;<br />
	Say I fear&rsquo;d Caesar, honour&rsquo;d him, and loved him.<br />
	If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony<br />
	May safely come to him, and be resolved<br />
	How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,<br />
	Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead<br />
	So well as Brutus living; but will follow<br />
	The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus<br />
	Thorough the hazards of this untrod state<br />
	With all true faith. So says my master Antony.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;<br />
	I never thought him worse.<br />
	Tell him, so please him come unto this place,<br />
	He shall be satisfied and, by my honour,<br />
	Depart untouch&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>
	SERVANT.<br />
	I&rsquo;ll fetch him presently.</p>
<p>
	[Exit.]</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	I know that we shall have him well to friend.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	I wish we may: but yet have I a mind<br />
	That fears him much; and my misgiving still<br />
	Falls shrewdly to the purpose.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	But here comes Antony.&mdash;</p>
<p>
	[Re-enter Antony.]</p>
<p>
	Welcome, Mark Antony.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?<br />
	Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,<br />
	Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.&mdash;<br />
	I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,<br />
	Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:<br />
	If I myself, there is no hour so fit<br />
	As Caesar&rsquo;s death-hour, nor no instrument<br />
	Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich<br />
	With the most noble blood of all this world.<br />
	I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,<br />
	Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,<br />
	Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years,<br />
	I shall not find myself so apt to die:<br />
	No place will please me so, no means of death,<br />
	As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,<br />
	The choice and master spirits of this age.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	O Antony, beg not your death of us!<br />
	Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,<br />
	As, by our hands and this our present act<br />
	You see we do; yet see you but our hands<br />
	And this the bleeding business they have done:<br />
	Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;<br />
	And pity to the general wrong of Rome&mdash;<br />
	As fire drives out fire, so pity pity&mdash;<br />
	Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,<br />
	To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;<br />
	Our arms in strength of amity, and our hearts<br />
	Of brothers&rsquo; temper, do receive you in<br />
	With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Your voice shall be as strong as any man&rsquo;s<br />
	In the disposing of new dignities.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Only be patient till we have appeased<br />
	The multitude, beside themselves with fear,<br />
	And then we will deliver you the cause<br />
	Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,<br />
	Have thus proceeded.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	I doubt not of your wisdom.<br />
	Let each man render me his bloody hand:<br />
	First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;&mdash;<br />
	Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;&mdash;<br />
	Now, Decius Brutus, yours;&mdash;now yours, Metellus;&mdash;<br />
	Yours, Cinna;&mdash;and, my valiant Casca, yours;&mdash;<br />
	Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.<br />
	Gentlemen all&mdash;alas, what shall I say?<br />
	My credit now stands on such slippery ground,<br />
	That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,<br />
	Either a coward or a flatterer.&mdash;<br />
	That I did love thee, Caesar, O, &lsquo;tis true:<br />
	If then thy spirit look upon us now,<br />
	Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death<br />
	To see thy Antony making his peace,<br />
	Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,&mdash;<br />
	Most noble!&mdash;in the presence of thy corse?<br />
	Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,<br />
	Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,<br />
	It would become me better than to close<br />
	In terms of friendship with thine enemies.<br />
	Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay&rsquo;d, brave hart;<br />
	Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,<br />
	Sign&rsquo;d in thy spoil, and crimson&rsquo;d in thy death.&mdash;<br />
	O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;<br />
	And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.&mdash;<br />
	How like a deer strucken by many princes,<br />
	Dost thou here lie!</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Mark Antony,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Pardon me, Caius Cassius:<br />
	The enemies of Caesar shall say this;<br />
	Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	I blame you not for praising Caesar so;<br />
	But what compact mean you to have with us?<br />
	Will you be prick&rsquo;d in number of our friends,<br />
	Or shall we on, and not depend on you?</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Therefore I took your hands; but was indeed<br />
	Sway&rsquo;d from the point, by looking down on Caesar.<br />
	Friends am I with you all, and love you all,<br />
	Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons<br />
	Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Or else were this a savage spectacle:<br />
	Our reasons are so full of good regard<br />
	That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,<br />
	You should be satisfied.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	That&rsquo;s all I seek:<br />
	And am moreover suitor that I may<br />
	Produce his body to the market-place;<br />
	And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,<br />
	Speak in the order of his funeral.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	You shall, Mark Antony.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Brutus, a word with you.<br />
	[Aside to Brutus.] You know not what you do; do not consent<br />
	That Antony speak in his funeral:<br />
	Know you how much the people may be moved<br />
	By that which he will utter?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	[Aside to Cassius.] By your pardon:<br />
	I will myself into the pulpit first,<br />
	And show the reason of our Caesar&rsquo;s death:<br />
	What Antony shall speak, I will protest<br />
	He speaks by leave and by permission;<br />
	And that we are contented Caesar shall<br />
	Have all true rights and lawful ceremonies.<br />
	It shall advantage more than do us wrong.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	[Aside to Brutus.] I know not what may fall; I like it not.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar&rsquo;s body.<br />
	You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,<br />
	But speak all good you can devise of Caesar;<br />
	And say you do&rsquo;t by our permission;<br />
	Else shall you not have any hand at all<br />
	About his funeral: and you shall speak<br />
	In the same pulpit whereto I am going,<br />
	After my speech is ended.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Be it so;<br />
	I do desire no more.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Prepare the body, then, and follow us.</p>
<p>
	[Exeunt all but Antony.]</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,<br />
	That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!<br />
	Thou art the ruins of the noblest man<br />
	That ever lived in the tide of times.<br />
	Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!<br />
	Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,&mdash;<br />
	Which, like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips<br />
	To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue,&mdash;<br />
	A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;<br />
	Domestic fury and fierce civil strife<br />
	Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;<br />
	Blood and destruction shall be so in use,<br />
	And dreadful objects so familiar,<br />
	That mothers shall but smile when they behold<br />
	Their infants quarter&rsquo;d with the hands of war;<br />
	All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:<br />
	And Caesar&rsquo;s spirit, ranging for revenge,<br />
	With Ate&rsquo; by his side come hot from Hell,<br />
	Shall in these confines with a monarch&rsquo;s voice<br />
	Cry &ldquo;Havoc!&rdquo; and let slip the dogs of war,<br />
	That this foul deed shall smell above the earth<br />
	With carrion men, groaning for burial.&mdash;</p>
<p>
	You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?</p>
<p>
	SERVANT.<br />
	I do, Mark Antony.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.</p>
<p>
	SERVANT.<br />
	He did receive his letters, and is coming;<br />
	And bid me say to you by word of mouth,&mdash;<br />
	[Seeing the body.] O Caesar!&mdash;</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.<br />
	Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,<br />
	Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,<br />
	Began to water. Is thy master coming?</p>
<p>
	SERVANT.<br />
	He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced.<br />
	Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,<br />
	No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;<br />
	Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay awhile;<br />
	Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse<br />
	Into the market-place: there shall I try,<br />
	In my oration, how the people take<br />
	The cruel issue of these bloody men;<br />
	According to the which thou shalt discourse<br />
	To young Octavius of the state of things.<br />
	Lend me your hand.</p>
<p>
	[Exeunt with Caesar&rsquo;s body.]</p>
