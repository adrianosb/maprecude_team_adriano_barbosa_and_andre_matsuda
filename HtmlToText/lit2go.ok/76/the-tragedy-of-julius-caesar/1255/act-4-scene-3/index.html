	SCENE III. within the tent of Brutus.</p>
<p>
	[Enter Brutus and Cassius.]</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	That you have wrong&rsquo;d me doth appear in this:<br />
	You have condemn&rsquo;d and noted Lucius Pella<br />
	For taking bribes here of the Sardians;<br />
	Whereas my letters, praying on his side<br />
	Because I knew the man, were slighted off.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	You wrong&rsquo;d yourself to write in such a case.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	In such a time as this it is not meet<br />
	That every nice offense should bear his comment.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself<br />
	Are much condemn&rsquo;d to have an itching palm,<br />
	To sell and mart your offices for gold<br />
	To undeservers.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	I an itching palm!<br />
	You know that you are Brutus that speak this,<br />
	Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	The name of Cassius honors this corruption,<br />
	And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Chastisement!</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Remember March, the Ides of March remember:<br />
	Did not great Julius bleed for justice&rsquo; sake?<br />
	What villain touch&rsquo;d his body, that did stab,<br />
	And not for justice? What! shall one of us,<br />
	That struck the foremost man of all this world<br />
	But for supporting robbers,&mdash;shall we now<br />
	Contaminate our fingers with base bribes<br />
	And sell the mighty space of our large honours<br />
	For so much trash as may be grasped thus?<br />
	I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,<br />
	Than such a Roman.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Brutus, bay not me,<br />
	I&rsquo;ll not endure it: you forget yourself,<br />
	To hedge me in; I am a soldier, ay,<br />
	Older in practice, abler than yourself<br />
	To make conditions.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Go to; you are not, Cassius.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	I am.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	I say you are not.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;<br />
	Have mind upon your health, tempt me no farther.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Away, slight man!</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Is&rsquo;t possible?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Hear me, for I will speak.<br />
	Must I give way and room to your rash choler?<br />
	Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	O gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	All this? ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;<br />
	Go show your slaves how choleric you are,<br />
	And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?<br />
	Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch<br />
	Under your testy humour? By the gods,<br />
	You shall digest the venom of your spleen,<br />
	Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,<br />
	I&rsquo;ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,<br />
	When you are waspish.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Is it come to this?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	You say you are a better soldier:<br />
	Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,<br />
	And it shall please me well: for mine own part,<br />
	I shall be glad to learn of abler men.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.<br />
	I said, an elder soldier, not a better:<br />
	Did I say &ldquo;better&rdquo;?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	If you did, I care not.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	I durst not?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	No.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	What, durst not tempt him?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	For your life you durst not.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Do not presume too much upon my love;<br />
	I may do that I shall be sorry for.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	You have done that you should be sorry for.<br />
	There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,<br />
	For I am arm&rsquo;d so strong in honesty,<br />
	That they pass by me as the idle wind<br />
	Which I respect not. I did send to you<br />
	For certain sums of gold, which you denied me;&mdash;<br />
	For I can raise no money by vile means:<br />
	By Heaven, I had rather coin my heart,<br />
	And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring<br />
	From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash<br />
	By any indirection:&mdash;I did send<br />
	To you for gold to pay my legions,<br />
	Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?<br />
	Should I have answer&rsquo;d Caius Cassius so?<br />
	When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous<br />
	To lock such rascal counters from his friends,<br />
	Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,<br />
	Dash him to pieces!</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	I denied you not.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	You did.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	I did not. He was but a fool<br />
	That brought my answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:<br />
	A friend should bear his friend&rsquo;s infirmities,<br />
	But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	I do not, till you practise them on me.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	You love me not.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	I do not like your faults.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	A friendly eye could never see such faults.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	A flatterer&rsquo;s would not, though they do appear<br />
	As huge as high Olympus.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Come, Antony and young Octavius, come,<br />
	Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,<br />
	For Cassius is a-weary of the world;<br />
	Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;<br />
	Check&rsquo;d like a bondman; all his faults observed,<br />
	Set in a note-book, learn&rsquo;d and conn&rsquo;d by rote,<br />
	To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep<br />
	My spirit from mine eyes!&mdash;There is my dagger,<br />
	And here my naked breast; within, a heart<br />
	Dearer than Plutus&rsquo; mine, richer than gold:<br />
	If that thou be&rsquo;st a Roman, take it forth;<br />
	I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:<br />
	Strike as thou didst at Caesar; for I know,<br />
	When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better<br />
	Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Sheathe your dagger:<br />
	Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;<br />
	Do what you will, dishonor shall be humour.<br />
	O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb<br />
	That carries anger as the flint bears fire;<br />
	Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,<br />
	And straight is cold again.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Hath Cassius lived<br />
	To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,<br />
	When grief, and blood ill-temper&rsquo;d, vexeth him?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	When I spoke that, I was ill-temper&rsquo;d too.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	And my heart too.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	O Brutus,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	What&rsquo;s the matter?</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	&mdash;Have not you love enough to bear with me,<br />
	When that rash humor which my mother gave me<br />
	Makes me forgetful?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Yes, Cassius; and from henceforth,<br />
	When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,<br />
	He&rsquo;ll think your mother chides, and leave you so.</p>
<p>
	[Noise within.]</p>
<p>
	POET.<br />
	[Within.] Let me go in to see the generals:<br />
	There is some grudge between &lsquo;em; &lsquo;tis not meet<br />
	They be alone.</p>
<p>
	LUCILIUS.<br />
	[Within.] You shall not come to them.</p>
<p>
	POET.<br />
	[Within.] Nothing but death shall stay me.</p>
<p>
	[Enter Poet, followed by Lucilius, and Titinius.]</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	How now! What&rsquo;s the matter?</p>
<p>
	POET.<br />
	For shame, you generals! what do you mean?<br />
	Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;<br />
	For I have seen more years, I&rsquo;m sure, than ye.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Bear with him, Brutus; &lsquo;tis his fashion.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	I&rsquo;ll know his humor when he knows his time:<br />
	What should the wars do with these jigging fools?&mdash;<br />
	Companion, hence!</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Away, away, be gone!</p>
<p>
	[Exit Poet.]</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders<br />
	Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	And come yourselves and bring Messala with you<br />
	Immediately to us.</p>
<p>
	[Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius.]</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Lucius, a bowl of wine!</p>
<p>
	[Exit Lucius.]</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	I did not think you could have been so angry.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Of your philosophy you make no use,<br />
	If you give place to accidental evils.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Ha! Portia!</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	She is dead.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	How &lsquo;scaped I killing, when I cross&rsquo;d you so?&mdash;<br />
	O insupportable and touching loss!&mdash;<br />
	Upon what sickness?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Impatient of my absence,<br />
	And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony<br />
	Have made themselves so strong;&mdash;for with her death<br />
	That tidings came;&mdash;with this she fell distract,<br />
	And, her attendants absent, swallow&rsquo;d fire.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	And died so?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Even so.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	O ye immortal gods!</p>
<p>
	[Re-enter Lucius, with wine and a taper.]</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Speak no more of her.&mdash;Give me a bowl of wine.&mdash;<br />
	In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.</p>
<p>
	[Drinks.]</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.<br />
	Fill, Lucius, till the wine o&rsquo;erswell the cup;<br />
	I cannot drink too much of Brutus&rsquo; love.</p>
<p>
	[Drinks.]</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Come in, Titinius!&mdash;</p>
<p>
	[Exit Lucius.]</p>
<p>
	[Re-enter Titinius, with Messala.]</p>
<p>
	Welcome, good Messala.&mdash;<br />
	Now sit we close about this taper here,<br />
	And call in question our necessities.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Portia, art thou gone?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	No more, I pray you.&mdash;<br />
	Messala, I have here received letters,<br />
	That young Octavius and Mark Antony<br />
	Come down upon us with a mighty power,<br />
	Bending their expedition toward Philippi.</p>
<p>
	MESSALA.<br />
	Myself have letters of the selfsame tenour.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	With what addition?</p>
<p>
	MESSALA.<br />
	That by proscription and bills of outlawry<br />
	Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus<br />
	Have put to death an hundred Senators.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	There in our letters do not well agree:<br />
	Mine speak of seventy Senators that died<br />
	By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Cicero one!</p>
<p>
	MESSALA.<br />
	Cicero is dead,<br />
	And by that order of proscription.&mdash;<br />
	Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	No, Messala.</p>
<p>
	MESSALA.<br />
	Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Nothing, Messala.</p>
<p>
	MESSALA.<br />
	That, methinks, is strange.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?</p>
<p>
	MESSALA.<br />
	No, my lord.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.</p>
<p>
	MESSALA.<br />
	Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:<br />
	For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:<br />
	With meditating that she must die once,<br />
	I have the patience to endure it now.</p>
<p>
	MESSALA.<br />
	Even so great men great losses should endure.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	I have as much of this in art as you,<br />
	But yet my nature could not bear it so.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Well, to our work alive. What do you think<br />
	Of marching to Philippi presently?</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	I do not think it good.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Your reason?</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	This it is:<br />
	&lsquo;Tis better that the enemy seek us;:<br />
	So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,<br />
	Doing himself offense; whilst we, lying still,<br />
	Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.<br />
	The people &lsquo;twixt Philippi and this ground<br />
	Do stand but in a forced affection;<br />
	For they have grudged us contribution:<br />
	The enemy, marching along by them,<br />
	By them shall make a fuller number up,<br />
	Come on refresh&rsquo;d, new-added, and encouraged;<br />
	From which advantage shall we cut him off,<br />
	If at Philippi we do face him there,<br />
	These people at our back.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Hear me, good brother.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Under your pardon. You must note besides,<br />
	That we have tried the utmost of our friends,<br />
	Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:<br />
	The enemy increaseth every day;<br />
	We, at the height, are ready to decline.<br />
	There is a tide in the affairs of men<br />
	Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;<br />
	Omitted, all the voyage of their life<br />
	Is bound in shallows and in miseries.<br />
	On such a full sea are we now afloat;<br />
	And we must take the current when it serves,<br />
	Or lose our ventures.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Then, with your will, go on:<br />
	We&rsquo;ll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	The deep of night is crept upon our talk,<br />
	And nature must obey necessity;<br />
	Which we will niggard with a little rest.<br />
	There is no more to say?</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	No more. Good night:<br />
	Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Lucius!&mdash;My gown.&mdash;Farewell now, good Messala:&mdash;<br />
	Good night, Titinius:&mdash;noble, noble Cassius,<br />
	Good night, and good repose.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	O my dear brother!<br />
	This was an ill beginning of the night.<br />
	Never come such division &lsquo;tween our souls!<br />
	Let it not, Brutus.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Every thing is well.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Good night, my lord.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Good night, good brother.</p>
<p>
	TITINIUS. MESSALA.<br />
	Good night, Lord Brutus.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Farewell, everyone.&mdash;</p>
<p>
	[Exeunt Cassius, Titinius, and Messala.]</p>
<p>
	[Re-enter Lucius, with the gown.]</p>
<p>
	Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	Here in the tent.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	What, thou speak&rsquo;st drowsily:<br />
	Poor knave, I blame thee not, thou art o&rsquo;er-watch&rsquo;d.<br />
	Call Claudius and some other of my men;<br />
	I&rsquo;ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	Varro and Claudius!</p>
<p>
	[Enter Varro and Claudius.]</p>
<p>
	VARRO.<br />
	Calls my lord?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;<br />
	It may be I shall raise you by-and-by<br />
	On business to my brother Cassius.</p>
<p>
	VARRO.<br />
	So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	I would not have it so; lie down, good sirs:<br />
	It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.&mdash;<br />
	Look, Lucius, here&rsquo;s the book I sought for so;<br />
	I put it in the pocket of my gown.</p>
<p>
	[Servants lie down.]</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	I was sure your lordship did not give it me.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.<br />
	Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,<br />
	And touch thy instrument a strain or two?</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	Ay, my lord, an&rsquo;t please you.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	It does, my boy:<br />
	I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	It is my duty, sir.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	I should not urge thy duty past thy might;<br />
	I know young bloods look for a time of rest.</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	I have slept, my lord, already.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;<br />
	I will not hold thee long: if I do live,<br />
	I will be good to thee.&mdash;</p>
<p>
	[Lucius plays and sings till he falls asleep.]</p>
<p>
	This is a sleepy tune.&mdash;O murderous Slumber,<br />
	Lay&rsquo;st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,<br />
	That plays thee music?&mdash;Gentle knave, good night;<br />
	I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:<br />
	If thou dost nod, thou breakst thy instrument;<br />
	I&rsquo;ll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.&mdash;<br />
	Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn&rsquo;d down<br />
	Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.</p>
<p>
	[Enter the Ghost of Caesar.]</p>
<p>
	How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?<br />
	I think it is the weakness of mine eyes<br />
	That shapes this monstrous apparition.<br />
	It comes upon me.&mdash;Art thou any thing?<br />
	Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,<br />
	That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?<br />
	Speak to me what thou art.</p>
<p>
	GHOST.<br />
	Thy evil spirit, Brutus.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Why comest thou?</p>
<p>
	GHOST.<br />
	To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Well; then I shall see thee again?</p>
<p>
	GHOST.<br />
	Ay, at Philippi.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.</p>
<p>
	[Ghost vanishes.]<br />
	Now I have taken heart, thou vanishest:<br />
	Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.&mdash;<br />
	Boy! Lucius, Varro, Claudius! Sirs, awake!</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	The strings, my lord, are false.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	He thinks he still is at his instrument.&mdash;<br />
	Lucius, awake!</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	My lord?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	My lord, I do not know that I did cry.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	Nothing, my lord.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Sleep again, Lucius.&mdash;Sirrah Claudius!&mdash;<br />
	[To Varro.] Fellow thou, awake!</p>
<p>
	VARRO.<br />
	My lord?</p>
<p>
	CLAUDIUS.<br />
	My lord?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?</p>
<p>
	VARRO. CLAUDIUS.<br />
	Did we, my lord?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Ay: saw you any thing?</p>
<p>
	VARRO.<br />
	No, my lord, I saw nothing.</p>
<p>
	CLAUDIUS.<br />
	Nor I, my lord.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;<br />
	Bid him set on his powers betimes before,<br />
	And we will follow.</p>
<p>
	VARRO. CLAUDIUS.<br />
	It shall be done, my lord.</p>
<p>
	[Exeunt.]</p>
