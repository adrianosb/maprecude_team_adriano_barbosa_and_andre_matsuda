	ACT II.</p>
<p>
	SCENE I. Rome. BRUTUS&rsquo;S orchard.</p>
<p>
	[Enter Brutus.]</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	What, Lucius, ho!&mdash;<br />
	I cannot, by the progress of the stars,<br />
	Give guess how near to day.&mdash;Lucius, I say!&mdash;<br />
	I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.&mdash;<br />
	When, Lucius, when! Awake, I say! What, Lucius!</p>
<p>
	[Enter Lucius.]</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	Call&rsquo;d you, my lord?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:<br />
	When it is lighted, come and call me here.</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	I will, my lord.</p>
<p>
	[Exit.]</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	It must be by his death: and, for my part,<br />
	I know no personal cause to spurn at him,<br />
	But for the general. He would be crown&rsquo;d:<br />
	How that might change his nature, there&rsquo;s the question:<br />
	It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;<br />
	And that craves wary walking. Crown him?&mdash;that:<br />
	And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,<br />
	That at his will he may do danger with.<br />
	Th&rsquo; abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins<br />
	Remorse from power; and, to speak truth of Caesar,<br />
	I have not known when his affections sway&rsquo;d<br />
	More than his reason. But &lsquo;tis a common proof,<br />
	That lowliness is young ambition&rsquo;s ladder,<br />
	Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;<br />
	But, when he once attains the upmost round,<br />
	He then unto the ladder turns his back,<br />
	Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees<br />
	By which he did ascend: so Caesar may;<br />
	Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel<br />
	Will bear no color for the thing he is,<br />
	Fashion it thus,&mdash;that what he is, augmented,<br />
	Would run to these and these extremities:<br />
	And therefore think him as a serpent&rsquo;s egg<br />
	Which hatch&rsquo;d, would, as his kind grow mischievous;<br />
	And kill him in the shell.</p>
<p>
	[Re-enter Lucius.]</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	The taper burneth in your closet, sir.<br />
	Searching the window for a flint I found<br />
	This paper thus seal&rsquo;d up, and I am sure<br />
	It did not lie there when I went to bed.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Get you to bed again; it is not day.<br />
	Is not tomorrow, boy, the Ides of March?</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	I know not, sir.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Look in the calendar, and bring me word.</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	I will, sir.</p>
<p>
	[Exit.]</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	The exhalations, whizzing in the air<br />
	Give so much light that I may read by them.&mdash;</p>
<p>
	[Opens the letter and reads.]<br />
	&ldquo;Brutus, thou sleep&rsquo;st: awake and see thyself.<br />
	Shall Rome, &amp;c. Speak, strike, redress&mdash;!<br />
	Brutus, thou sleep&rsquo;st: awake!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Such instigations have been often dropp&rsquo;d<br />
	Where I have took them up.<br />
	&ldquo;Shall Rome, &amp; c.&rdquo; Thus must I piece it out:<br />
	Shall Rome stand under one man&rsquo;s awe? What, Rome?<br />
	My ancestors did from the streets of Rome<br />
	The Tarquin drive, when he was call&rsquo;d a king.&mdash;<br />
	&ldquo;Speak, strike, redress!&rdquo;&mdash;Am I entreated, then,<br />
	To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,<br />
	If the redress will follow, thou receivest<br />
	Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!</p>
<p>
	[Re-enter Lucius.]</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.</p>
<p>
	[Knocking within.]</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	&lsquo;Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.&mdash;</p>
<p>
	[Exit Lucius.]</p>
<p>
	Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar<br />
	I have not slept.<br />
	Between the acting of a dreadful thing<br />
	And the first motion, all the interim is<br />
	Like a phantasma or a hideous dream:<br />
	The genius and the mortal instruments<br />
	Are then in council; and the state of man,<br />
	Like to a little kingdom, suffers then<br />
	The nature of an insurrection.</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	Sir, &lsquo;tis your brother Cassius at the door,<br />
	Who doth desire to see you.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Is he alone?</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	No, sir, there are more with him.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Do you know them?</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	No, sir, their hats are pluck&rsquo;d about their ears,<br />
	And half their faces buried in their cloaks,<br />
	That by no means I may discover them<br />
	By any mark of favor.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Let &lsquo;em enter.&mdash;</p>
<p>
	[Exit Lucius.]<br />
	They are the faction.&mdash;O conspiracy,<br />
	Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,<br />
	When evils are most free? O, then, by day<br />
	Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough<br />
	To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;<br />
	Hide it in smiles and affability:<br />
	For if thou pass, thy native semblance on,<br />
	Not Erebus itself were dim enough<br />
	To hide thee from prevention.</p>
<p>
	[Enter Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna, Metellus Cimber, and<br />
	Trebonius.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	I think we are too bold upon your rest:<br />
	Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	I have been up this hour, awake all night.<br />
	Know I these men that come along with you?</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Yes, every man of them; and no man here<br />
	But honors you; and every one doth wish<br />
	You had but that opinion of yourself<br />
	Which every noble Roman bears of you.<br />
	This is Trebonius.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	He is welcome hither.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	This Decius Brutus.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	He is welcome too.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	They are all welcome.&mdash;<br />
	What watchful cares do interpose themselves<br />
	Betwixt your eyes and night?</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Shall I entreat a word?</p>
<p>
	[BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper apart.]</p>
<p>
	DECIUS.<br />
	Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	No.</p>
<p>
	CINNA.<br />
	O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yon grey lines<br />
	That fret the clouds are messengers of day.</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	You shall confess that you are both deceived.<br />
	Here, as I point my sword, the Sun arises;<br />
	Which is a great way growing on the South,<br />
	Weighing the youthful season of the year.<br />
	Some two months hence, up higher toward the North<br />
	He first presents his fire; and the high East<br />
	Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Give me your hands all over, one by one.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	And let us swear our resolution.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	No, not an oath: if not the face of men,<br />
	The sufferance of our souls, the time&rsquo;s abuse&mdash;<br />
	If these be motives weak, break off betimes,<br />
	And every man hence to his idle bed;<br />
	So let high-sighted tyranny range on,<br />
	Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,<br />
	As I am sure they do, bear fire enough<br />
	To kindle cowards, and to steel with valour<br />
	The melting spirits of women; then, countrymen,<br />
	What need we any spur but our own cause<br />
	To prick us to redress? what other bond<br />
	Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,<br />
	And will not palter? and what other oath<br />
	Than honesty to honesty engaged,<br />
	That this shall be, or we will fall for it?<br />
	Swear priests, and cowards, and men cautelous,<br />
	Old feeble carrions, and such suffering souls<br />
	That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear<br />
	Such creatures as men doubt: but do not stain<br />
	The even virtue of our enterprise,<br />
	Nor th&rsquo; insuppressive mettle of our spirits,<br />
	To think that or our cause or our performance<br />
	Did need an oath; when every drop of blood<br />
	That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,<br />
	Is guilty of a several bastardy,<br />
	If he do break the smallest particle<br />
	Of any promise that hath pass&rsquo;d from him.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?<br />
	I think he will stand very strong with us.</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Let us not leave him out.</p>
<p>
	CINNA.<br />
	No, by no means.</p>
<p>
	METELLUS.<br />
	O, let us have him! for his silver hairs<br />
	Will purchase us a good opinion,<br />
	And buy men&rsquo;s voices to commend our deeds:<br />
	It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;<br />
	Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,<br />
	But all be buried in his gravity.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	O, name him not! let us not break with him;<br />
	For he will never follow any thing<br />
	That other men begin.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Then leave him out.</p>
<p>
	CASCA.<br />
	Indeed, he is not fit.</p>
<p>
	DECIUS.<br />
	Shall no man else be touch&rsquo;d but only Caesar?</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Decius, well urged.&mdash;I think it is not meet,<br />
	Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,<br />
	Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him<br />
	A shrewd contriver; and you know his means,<br />
	If he improve them, may well stretch so far<br />
	As to annoy us all: which to prevent,<br />
	Let Antony and Caesar fall together.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,<br />
	To cut the head off, and then hack the limbs,<br />
	Like wrath in death, and envy afterwards;<br />
	For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.<br />
	Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.<br />
	We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;<br />
	And in the spirit of men there is no blood:<br />
	O, that we then could come by Caesar&rsquo;s spirit,<br />
	And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,<br />
	Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,<br />
	Let&rsquo;s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;<br />
	Let&rsquo;s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,<br />
	Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds;<br />
	And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,<br />
	Stir up their servants to an act of rage,<br />
	And after seem to chide &lsquo;em. This shall mark<br />
	Our purpose necessary, and not envious;<br />
	Which so appearing to the common eyes,<br />
	We shall be call&rsquo;d purgers, not murderers.<br />
	And for Mark Antony, think not of him;<br />
	For he can do no more than Caesar&rsquo;s arm<br />
	When Caesar&rsquo;s head is off.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Yet I do fear him;<br />
	For in th&rsquo; ingrafted love he bears to Caesar&mdash;</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:<br />
	If he love Caesar, all that he can do<br />
	Is to himself,&mdash;take thought and die for Caesar.<br />
	And that were much he should; for he is given<br />
	To sports, to wildness, and much company.</p>
<p>
	TREBONIUS.<br />
	There is no fear in him; let him not die;<br />
	For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.</p>
<p>
	[Clock strikes.]</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Peace! count the clock.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	The clock hath stricken three.</p>
<p>
	TREBONIUS.<br />
	&lsquo;Tis time to part.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	But it is doubtful yet<br />
	Whether Caesar will come forth today or no;<br />
	For he is superstitious grown of late,<br />
	Quite from the main opinion he held once<br />
	Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.<br />
	It may be these apparent prodigies,<br />
	The unaccustom&rsquo;d terror of this night,<br />
	And the persuasion of his augurers<br />
	May hold him from the Capitol to-day.</p>
<p>
	DECIUS.<br />
	Never fear that: if he be so resolved,<br />
	I can o&rsquo;ersway him, for he loves to hear<br />
	That unicorns may be betray&rsquo;d with trees,<br />
	And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,<br />
	Lions with toils, and men with flatterers:<br />
	But when I tell him he hates flatterers,<br />
	He says he does, being then most flattered.<br />
	Let me work;<br />
	For I can give his humor the true bent,<br />
	And I will bring him to the Capitol.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?</p>
<p>
	CINNA.<br />
	Be that the uttermost; and fail not then.</p>
<p>
	METELLUS.<br />
	Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,<br />
	Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:<br />
	I wonder none of you have thought of him.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Now, good Metellus, go along by him:<br />
	He loves me well, and I have given him reason;<br />
	Send him but hither, and I&rsquo;ll fashion him.</p>
<p>
	CASSIUS.<br />
	The morning comes upon &rsquo;s. We&rsquo;ll leave you, Brutus;&mdash;<br />
	And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember<br />
	What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;<br />
	Let not our looks put on our purposes,<br />
	But bear it as our Roman actors do,<br />
	With untired spirits and formal constancy:<br />
	And so, good morrow to you every one.&mdash;</p>
<p>
	[Exeunt all but Brutus.]</p>
<p>
	Boy! Lucius!&mdash;Fast asleep? It is no matter;<br />
	Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:<br />
	Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,<br />
	Which busy care draws in the brains of men;<br />
	Therefore thou sleep&rsquo;st so sound.</p>
<p>
	[Enter Portia.]</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Brutus, my lord!</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?<br />
	It is not for your health thus to commit<br />
	Your weak condition to the raw-cold morning.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Nor for yours neither. You&rsquo;ve ungently, Brutus,<br />
	Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,<br />
	You suddenly arose, and walk&rsquo;d about,<br />
	Musing and sighing, with your arms across;<br />
	And, when I ask&rsquo;d you what the matter was,<br />
	You stared upon me with ungentle looks:<br />
	I urged you further; then you scratch&rsquo;d your head,<br />
	And too impatiently stamp&rsquo;d with your foot:<br />
	Yet I insisted, yet you answer&rsquo;d not;<br />
	But, with an angry wafture of your hand,<br />
	Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did;<br />
	Fearing to strengthen that impatience<br />
	Which seem&rsquo;d too much enkindled; and withal<br />
	Hoping it was but an effect of humour,<br />
	Which sometime hath his hour with every man.<br />
	It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep;<br />
	And, could it work so much upon your shape<br />
	As it hath much prevail&rsquo;d on your condition,<br />
	I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,<br />
	Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	I am not well in health, and that is all.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,<br />
	He would embrace the means to come by it.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Is Brutus sick? and is it physical<br />
	To walk unbraced and suck up the humours<br />
	Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,<br />
	And will he steal out of his wholesome bed<br />
	To dare the vile contagion of the night,<br />
	And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air<br />
	To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;<br />
	You have some sick offense within your mind,<br />
	Which, by the right and virtue of my place,<br />
	I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,<br />
	I charge you, by my once commended beauty,<br />
	By all your vows of love, and that great vow<br />
	Which did incorporate and make us one,<br />
	That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,<br />
	Why you are heavy, and what men to-night<br />
	Have had resort to you; for here have been<br />
	Some six or seven, who did hide their faces<br />
	Even from darkness.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Kneel not, gentle Portia.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.<br />
	Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,<br />
	Is it excepted I should know no secrets<br />
	That appertain to you? Am I yourself<br />
	But, as it were, in sort or limitation,&mdash;<br />
	To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,<br />
	And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs<br />
	Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,<br />
	Portia is Brutus&rsquo; harlot, not his wife.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	You are my true and honorable wife;<br />
	As dear to me as are the ruddy drops<br />
	That visit my sad heart.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	If this were true, then should I know this secret.<br />
	I grant I am a woman; but withal<br />
	A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:<br />
	I grant I am a woman; but withal<br />
	A woman well reputed, Cato&rsquo;s daughter.<br />
	Think you I am no stronger than my sex,<br />
	Being so father&rsquo;d and so husbanded?<br />
	Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose &lsquo;em.<br />
	I have made strong proof of my constancy,<br />
	Giving myself a voluntary wound<br />
	Here in the thigh: can I bear that with patience<br />
	And not my husband&rsquo;s secrets?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	O ye gods,<br />
	Render me worthy of this noble wife!</p>
<p>
	[Knocking within.]</p>
<p>
	Hark, hark, one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;<br />
	And by and by thy bosom shall partake<br />
	The secrets of my heart:<br />
	All my engagements I will construe to thee,<br />
	All the charactery of my sad brows.<br />
	Leave me with haste.</p>
<p>
	[Exit Portia.]</p>
<p>
	&mdash;Lucius, who&rsquo;s that knocks?</p>
<p>
	[Re-enter Lucius with Ligarius.]</p>
<p>
	LUCIUS.<br />
	Here is a sick man that would speak with you.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.&mdash;<br />
	Boy, stand aside.&mdash;Caius Ligarius,&mdash;how?</p>
<p>
	LIGARIUS.<br />
	Vouchsafe good-morrow from a feeble tongue.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,<br />
	To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!</p>
<p>
	LIGARIUS.<br />
	I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand<br />
	Any exploit worthy the name of honour.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,<br />
	Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.</p>
<p>
	LIGARIUS.<br />
	By all the gods that Romans bow before,<br />
	I here discard my sickness. Soul of Rome!<br />
	Brave son, derived from honorable loins!<br />
	Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up<br />
	My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,<br />
	And I will strive with things impossible;<br />
	Yea, get the better of them. What&rsquo;s to do?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	A piece of work that will make sick men whole.</p>
<p>
	LIGARIUS.<br />
	But are not some whole that we must make sick?</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	That must we also. What it is, my Caius,<br />
	I shall unfold to thee, as we are going,<br />
	To whom it must be done.</p>
<p>
	LIGARIUS.<br />
	Set on your foot;<br />
	And with a heart new-fired I follow you,<br />
	To do I know not what: but it sufficeth<br />
	That Brutus leads me on.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Follow me then.</p>
<p>
	[Exeunt.]</p>
