	SCENE II. The same. The Forum.</p>
<p>
	[Enter Brutus and Cassius, with a throng of Citizens.]</p>
<p>
	CITIZENS.<br />
	We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.&mdash;<br />
	Cassius, go you into the other street<br />
	And part the numbers.&mdash;<br />
	Those that will hear me speak, let &lsquo;em stay here;<br />
	Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;<br />
	And public reasons shall be rendered<br />
	Of Caesar&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>
	FIRST CITIZEN.<br />
	I will hear Brutus speak.</p>
<p>
	SECOND CITIZEN.<br />
	I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,<br />
	When severally we hear them rendered.</p>
<p>
	[Exit Cassius, with some of the Citizens. Brutus goes into the<br />
	rostrum.]</p>
<p>
	THIRD CITIZEN.<br />
	The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Be patient till the last.<br />
	Romans, countrymen, and lovers! Hear me for my cause; and be<br />
	silent, that you may hear: believe me for mine honour, and have<br />
	respect to mine honor, that you may believe: censure me in your<br />
	wisdom; and awake your senses, that you may the better judge.<br />
	If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar&rsquo;s, to<br />
	him I say that Brutus&rsquo; love to Caesar was no less than his. If<br />
	then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is<br />
	my answer,&mdash;Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome<br />
	more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than<br />
	that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I<br />
	weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was<br />
	valiant, I honour him; but, as he was ambitious, I slew him.<br />
	There is tears for his love; joy for his fortune; honour for his<br />
	valour; and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that<br />
	would be a bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who<br />
	is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak; for him<br />
	have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his<br />
	country? If any, speak; for him have I offended. I pause for a<br />
	reply.</p>
<p>
	CITIZENS.<br />
	None, Brutus, none.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar<br />
	than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is<br />
	enroll&rsquo;d in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he<br />
	was worthy;, nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered<br />
	death.</p>
<p>
	[Enter Antony and others, with Caesar&rsquo;s body.]</p>
<p>
	Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had<br />
	no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a<br />
	place in the commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this<br />
	I depart&mdash; that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I<br />
	have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my country<br />
	to need my death.</p>
<p>
	CITIZENS.<br />
	Live, Brutus! live, live!</p>
<p>
	FIRST CITIZEN.<br />
	Bring him with triumph home unto his house.</p>
<p>
	SECOND CITIZEN.<br />
	Give him a statue with his ancestors.</p>
<p>
	THIRD CITIZEN.<br />
	Let him be Caesar.</p>
<p>
	FOURTH CITIZEN.<br />
	Caesar&rsquo;s better parts<br />
	Shall be crown&rsquo;d in Brutus.</p>
<p>
	FIRST CITIZEN.<br />
	We&rsquo;ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamours.</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	My countrymen,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	SECOND CITIZEN.<br />
	Peace! silence! Brutus speaks.</p>
<p>
	FIRST CITIZEN.<br />
	Peace, ho!</p>
<p>
	BRUTUS.<br />
	Good countrymen, let me depart alone,<br />
	And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:<br />
	Do grace to Caesar&rsquo;s corpse, and grace his speech<br />
	Tending to Caesar&rsquo;s glory; which Mark Antony,<br />
	By our permission, is allow&rsquo;d to make.<br />
	I do entreat you, not a man depart,<br />
	Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.</p>
<p>
	[Exit.]</p>
<p>
	FIRST CITIZEN.<br />
	Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.</p>
<p>
	THIRD CITIZEN.<br />
	Let him go up into the public chair;<br />
	We&rsquo;ll hear him.&mdash;Noble Antony, go up.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	For Brutus&rsquo; sake, I am beholding to you.</p>
<p>
	[Goes up.]</p>
<p>
	FOURTH CITIZEN.<br />
	What does he say of Brutus?</p>
<p>
	THIRD CITIZEN.<br />
	He says, for Brutus&rsquo; sake,<br />
	He finds himself beholding to us all.</p>
<p>
	FOURTH CITIZEN.<br />
	&lsquo;Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.</p>
<p>
	FIRST CITIZEN.<br />
	This Caesar was a tyrant.</p>
<p>
	THIRD CITIZEN.<br />
	Nay, that&rsquo;s certain:<br />
	We are blest that Rome is rid of him.</p>
<p>
	SECOND CITIZEN.<br />
	Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	You gentle Romans,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	CITIZENS.<br />
	Peace, ho! let us hear him.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;<br />
	I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.<br />
	The evil that men do lives after them;<br />
	The good is oft interred with their bones:<br />
	So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus<br />
	Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:<br />
	If it were so, it was a grievous fault;<br />
	And grievously hath Caesar answer&rsquo;d it.<br />
	Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,&mdash;<br />
	For Brutus is an honourable man;<br />
	So are they all, all honorable men,&mdash;<br />
	Come I to speak in Caesar&rsquo;s funeral.<br />
	He was my friend, faithful and just to me:<br />
	But Brutus says he was ambitious;<br />
	And Brutus is an honourable man.<br />
	He hath brought many captives home to Rome,<br />
	Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:<br />
	Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?<br />
	When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:<br />
	Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:<br />
	Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br />
	And Brutus is an honourable man.<br />
	You all did see that on the Lupercal<br />
	I thrice presented him a kingly crown,<br />
	Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?<br />
	Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br />
	And, sure, he is an honourable man.<br />
	I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,<br />
	But here I am to speak what I do know.<br />
	You all did love him once,&mdash;not without cause:<br />
	What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?&mdash;<br />
	O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,<br />
	And men have lost their reason!&mdash;Bear with me;<br />
	My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,<br />
	And I must pause till it come back to me.</p>
<p>
	FIRST CITIZEN.<br />
	Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.</p>
<p>
	SECOND CITIZEN.<br />
	If thou consider rightly of the matter,<br />
	Caesar has had great wrong.</p>
<p>
	THIRD CITIZEN.<br />
	Has he not, masters?<br />
	I fear there will a worse come in his place.</p>
<p>
	FOURTH CITIZEN.<br />
	Mark&rsquo;d ye his words? He would not take the crown;<br />
	Therefore &lsquo;tis certain he was not ambitious.</p>
<p>
	FIRST CITIZEN.<br />
	If it be found so, some will dear abide it.</p>
<p>
	SECOND CITIZEN.<br />
	Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.</p>
<p>
	THIRD CITIZEN.<br />
	There&rsquo;s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.</p>
<p>
	FOURTH CITIZEN.<br />
	Now mark him; he begins again to speak.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	But yesterday the word of Caesar might<br />
	Have stood against the world: now lies he there,<br />
	And none so poor to do him reverence.<br />
	O masters, if I were disposed to stir<br />
	Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,<br />
	I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,<br />
	Who, you all know, are honourable men:<br />
	I will not do them wrong; I rather choose<br />
	To wrong the dead, to wrong myself, and you,<br />
	Than I will wrong such honourable men.<br />
	But here&rsquo;s a parchment with the seal of Caesar,&mdash;<br />
	I found it in his closet,&mdash;&rsquo;tis his will:<br />
	Let but the commons hear this testament,&mdash;<br />
	Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read,&mdash;<br />
	And they would go and kiss dead Caesar&rsquo;s wounds,<br />
	And dip their napkins in his sacred blood;<br />
	Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,<br />
	And, dying, mention it within their wills,<br />
	Bequeathing it as a rich legacy<br />
	Unto their issue.</p>
<p>
	FOURTH CITIZEN.<br />
	We&rsquo;ll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.</p>
<p>
	CITIZENS.<br />
	The will, the will! We will hear Caesar&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;<br />
	It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.<br />
	You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;<br />
	And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,<br />
	It will inflame you, it will make you mad.<br />
	&lsquo;Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;<br />
	For if you should, O, what would come of it!</p>
<p>
	FOURTH CITIZEN.<br />
	Read the will! we&rsquo;ll hear it, Antony;<br />
	You shall read us the will,&mdash;Caesar&rsquo;s will!</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?<br />
	I have o&rsquo;ershot myself to tell you of it:<br />
	I fear I wrong the honorable men<br />
	Whose daggers have stabb&rsquo;d Caesar; I do fear it.</p>
<p>
	FOURTH CITIZEN.<br />
	They were traitors: honourable men!</p>
<p>
	CITIZENS.<br />
	The will! The testament!</p>
<p>
	SECOND CITIZEN.<br />
	They were villains, murderers. The will! read the will!</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	You will compel me, then, to read the will?<br />
	Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,<br />
	And let me show you him that made the will.<br />
	Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?</p>
<p>
	CITIZENS.<br />
	Come down.</p>
<p>
	SECOND CITIZEN.<br />
	Descend.</p>
<p>
	[He comes down.]</p>
<p>
	THIRD CITIZEN.<br />
	You shall have leave.</p>
<p>
	FOURTH CITIZEN.<br />
	A ring! stand round.</p>
<p>
	FIRST CITIZEN.<br />
	Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.</p>
<p>
	SECOND CITIZEN.<br />
	Room for Antony!&mdash;most noble Antony!</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Nay, press not so upon me; stand far&rsquo; off.</p>
<p>
	CITIZENS.<br />
	Stand back; room! bear back.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.<br />
	You all do know this mantle: I remember<br />
	The first time ever Caesar put it on;<br />
	&lsquo;Twas on a Summer&rsquo;s evening, in his tent,<br />
	That day he overcame the Nervii.<br />
	Look, in this place ran Cassius&rsquo; dagger through:<br />
	See what a rent the envious Casca made:<br />
	Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb&rsquo;d;<br />
	And as he pluck&rsquo;d his cursed steel away,<br />
	Mark how the blood of Caesar follow&rsquo;d it,&mdash;<br />
	As rushing out of doors, to be resolved<br />
	If Brutus so unkindly knock&rsquo;d, or no;<br />
	For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar&rsquo;s angel:<br />
	Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!<br />
	This was the most unkindest cut of all;<br />
	For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,<br />
	Ingratitude, more strong than traitors&rsquo; arms,<br />
	Quite vanquish&rsquo;d him: then burst his mighty heart;<br />
	And, in his mantle muffling up his face,<br />
	Even at the base of Pompey&rsquo;s statua,<br />
	Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.<br />
	O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!<br />
	Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,<br />
	Whilst bloody treason flourish&rsquo;d over us.<br />
	O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel<br />
	The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.<br />
	Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold<br />
	Our Caesar&rsquo;s vesture wounded? Look you here,<br />
	Here is himself, marr&rsquo;d, as you see, with traitors.</p>
<p>
	FIRST CITIZEN.<br />
	O piteous spectacle!</p>
<p>
	SECOND CITIZEN.<br />
	O noble Caesar!</p>
<p>
	THIRD CITIZEN.<br />
	O woeful day!</p>
<p>
	FOURTH CITIZEN.<br />
	O traitors, villains!</p>
<p>
	FIRST CITIZEN.<br />
	O most bloody sight!</p>
<p>
	SECOND CITIZEN.<br />
	We will be revenged.</p>
<p>
	CITIZENS.<br />
	Revenge,&mdash;about,&mdash;seek,&mdash;burn,&mdash;fire,&mdash;kill,&mdash;slay,&mdash;let not a<br />
	traitor live!</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Stay, countrymen.</p>
<p>
	FIRST CITIZEN.<br />
	Peace there! hear the noble Antony.</p>
<p>
	SECOND CITIZEN.<br />
	We&rsquo;ll hear him, we&rsquo;ll follow him, we&rsquo;ll die with him.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up<br />
	To such a sudden flood of mutiny.<br />
	They that have done this deed are honourable:<br />
	What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,<br />
	That made them do it; they&rsquo;re wise and honourable,<br />
	And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.<br />
	I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:<br />
	I am no orator, as Brutus is;<br />
	But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,<br />
	That love my friend; and that they know full well<br />
	That gave me public leave to speak of him:<br />
	For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,<br />
	Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,<br />
	To stir men&rsquo;s blood: I only speak right on;<br />
	I tell you that which you yourselves do know;<br />
	Show you sweet Caesar&rsquo;s wounds, poor dumb mouths,<br />
	And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,<br />
	And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony<br />
	Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue<br />
	In every wound of Caesar, that should move<br />
	The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.</p>
<p>
	CITIZENS.<br />
	We&rsquo;ll mutiny.</p>
<p>
	FIRST CITIZEN.<br />
	We&rsquo;ll burn the house of Brutus.</p>
<p>
	THIRD CITIZEN.<br />
	Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.</p>
<p>
	CITIZENS.<br />
	Peace, ho! hear Antony; most noble Antony!</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.<br />
	Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?<br />
	Alas, you know not; I must tell you then:<br />
	You have forgot the will I told you of.</p>
<p>
	CITIZENS.<br />
	Most true; the will!&mdash;let&rsquo;s stay, and hear the will.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Here is the will, and under Caesar&rsquo;s seal.<br />
	To every Roman citizen he gives,<br />
	To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.</p>
<p>
	SECOND CITIZEN.<br />
	Most noble Caesar!&mdash;we&rsquo;ll revenge his death.</p>
<p>
	THIRD CITIZEN.<br />
	O, royal Caesar!</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Hear me with patience.</p>
<p>
	CITIZENS.<br />
	Peace, ho!</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,<br />
	His private arbors, and new-planted orchards,<br />
	On this side Tiber: he hath left them you,<br />
	And to your heirs forever; common pleasures,<br />
	To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.<br />
	Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?</p>
<p>
	FIRST CITIZEN.<br />
	Never, never.&mdash;Come, away, away!<br />
	We&rsquo;ll burn his body in the holy place,<br />
	And with the brands fire the traitors&rsquo; houses.<br />
	Take up the body.</p>
<p>
	SECOND CITIZEN.<br />
	Go, fetch fire.</p>
<p>
	THIRD CITIZEN.<br />
	Pluck down benches.</p>
<p>
	FOURTH CITIZEN.<br />
	Pluck down forms, windows, any thing.</p>
<p>
	[Exeunt Citizens, with the body.]</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Now let it work.&mdash;Mischief, thou art afoot,<br />
	Take thou what course thou wilt!&mdash;</p>
<p>
	[Enter a Servant.]</p>
<p>
	How now, fellow?</p>
<p>
	SERVANT.<br />
	Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Where is he?</p>
<p>
	SERVANT.<br />
	He and Lepidus are at Caesar&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	And thither will I straight to visit him:<br />
	He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,<br />
	And in this mood will give us any thing.</p>
<p>
	SERVANT.<br />
	I heard &lsquo;em say Brutus and Cassius<br />
	Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.</p>
<p>
	ANTONY.<br />
	Belike they had some notice of the people,<br />
	How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.</p>
<p>
	[Exeunt.]</p>
