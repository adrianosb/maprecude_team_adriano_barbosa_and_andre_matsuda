	HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS (Foresail rises and discovers the watch standing, lounging, leaning, and lying in various attitudes, all singing in chorus.)</p>
<p>
	Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies! Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain! Our captain&rsquo;s commanded.-</p>
<p>
	1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR Oh, boys, don&rsquo;t be sentimental. it&rsquo;s bad for the digestion! Take a tonic, follow me! (Sings, and all follow) Our captain stood upon the deck, A spy-glass in his hand, A viewing of those gallant whales That blew at every strand. Oh, your tubs in your boats, my boys, And by your braces stand, And we&rsquo;ll have one of those fine whales, Hand, boys, over hand! So, be cheery, my lads! may your hearts never fail! While the bold harpooneer is striking the whale!</p>
<p>
	MATE&rsquo;S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK Eight bells there, forward!</p>
<p>
	2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR Avast the chorus! Eight bells there! d&rsquo;ye hear, bell-boy? Strike the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me call the watch. I&rsquo;ve the sort of mouth for that- the hogshead mouth. So, so, (thrusts his head down the scuttle,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y! Eight bells there below! Tumble up!</p>
<p>
	DUTCH SAILOR Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark this in our old Mogul&rsquo;s wine; it&rsquo;s quite as deadening to some as filliping to others. We sing; they sleep- aye, lie down there, like ground-tier butts. At &lsquo;em again! There, take this copper-pump, and hail &lsquo;em through it. Tell &lsquo;em to avast dreaming of their lassies. Tell &lsquo;em it&rsquo;s the resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to judgment. That&rsquo;s the way- that&rsquo;s it; thy throat ain&rsquo;t spoiled with eating Amsterdam butter.</p>
<p>
	FRENCH SAILOR Hist, boys! let&rsquo;s have a jig or two before we ride to anchor in Blanket Bay. What say ye? There comes the other watch. Stand by all legs! Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!</p>
<p>
	PIP (Sulky and sleepy) Don&rsquo;t know where it is.</p>
<p>
	FRENCH SAILOR Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. Jig it, men, I say; merry&rsquo;s the word; hurrah! Damn me, won&rsquo;t you dance? Form, now, Indian-file, and gallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves! Legs! legs!</p>
<p>
	ICELAND SAILOR I don&rsquo;t like your floor, maty; it&rsquo;s too springy to my taste. I&rsquo;m used to ice-floors. I&rsquo;m sorry to throw cold water on the subject; but excuse me.</p>
<p>
	MALTESE SAILOR Me too; where&rsquo;s your girls? Who but a fool would take his left hand by his right, and say to himself, how d&rsquo;ye do? Partners! I must have partners!</p>
<p>
	SICILIAN SAILOR Aye; girls and a green!- then I&rsquo;ll hop with ye; yea, turn grasshopper!</p>
<p>
	LONG-ISLAND SAILOR Well, well, ye sulkies, there&rsquo;s plenty more of us. Hoe corn when you may, say I. All legs go to harvest soon. Ah! here comes the music; now for it!</p>
<p>
	AZORE SAILOR (Ascending, and pitching the tambourine up the scuttle.) Here you are, Pip; and there&rsquo;s the windlass-bits; up you mount! Now, boys! (The half of them dance to the tambourine; some go below; some sleep or lie among the coils of rigging. Oaths a-plenty.)</p>
<p>
	AZORE SAILOR (Dancing) Go it, Pip! Bang it, bell-boy! Rig it, dig it, stig it, quig it, bell-boy! Make fire-flies; break the jinglers!</p>
<p>
	PIP Jinglers, you say?- there goes another, dropped off; I pound it so.</p>
<p>
	CHINA SAILOR Rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of thyself.</p>
<p>
	FRENCH SAILOR Merry-mad! Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through it! Split jibs! tear yourself!</p>
<p>
	TASHTEGO (Quietly smoking) That&rsquo;s a white man; he calls that fun: humph! I save my sweat.</p>
<p>
	OLD MANX SAILOR I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what they are dancing over. I&rsquo;ll dance over your grave, I will- that&rsquo;s the bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round corners. O Christ! to think of the green navies and the green-skulled crews! Well, well; belike the whole world&rsquo;s a ball, as you scholars have it; and so &lsquo;tis right to make one ballroom of it. Dance on, lads, you&rsquo;re young; I was once.</p>
<p>
	3D NANTUCKET SAILOR Spell oh!- whew! this is worse than pulling after whales in a calm- give a whiff, Tash. (They cease dancing, and gather in clusters. Meantime the sky darkens- the wind rises.)</p>
<p>
	LASCAR SAILOR By Brahma! boys, it&rsquo;ll be douse sail soon. The sky-born, high-tide Ganges turned to wind! Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!</p>
<p>
	MALTESE SAILOR (Reclining and shaking his cap) It&rsquo;s the waves- the snow&rsquo;s caps turn to jig it now. They&rsquo;ll shake their tassels soon. Now would all the waves were women, then I&rsquo;d go drown, and chassee with them evermore! There&rsquo;s naught so sweet on earth- heaven may not match it!- as those swift glances of warm, wild bosoms in the dance, when the over-arboring arms hide such ripe, bursting grapes.</p>
<p>
	SICILIAN SAILOR (Reclining) Tell me not of it! Hark ye, lad- fleet interlacings of the limbs- lithe swayings- coyings- flutterings! lip! heart! hip! all graze: unceasing touch and go! not taste, observe ye, else come satiety. Eh, Pagan? (Nudging.)</p>
<p>
	TAHITAN SAILOR (Reclining on a mat) Hail, holy nakedness of our dancing girls!- the Heeva-Heeva! Ah! low veiled, high palmed Tahiti! I still rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid! I saw thee woven in the wood, my mat! green the first day I brought ye thence; now worn and wilted quite. Ah me!- not thou nor I can bear the change! How then, if so be transplanted to yon sky? Hear I the roaring streams from Pirohitee&rsquo;s peak of spears, when they leap down the crags and drown the villages?- The blast, the blast! Up, spine, and meet it! (Leaps to his feet.)</p>
<p>
	PORTUGUESE SAILOR How the sea rolls swashing &lsquo;gainst the side! Stand by for reefing, hearties! the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell they&rsquo;ll go lunging presently.</p>
<p>
	DANISH SAILOR Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou holdest! Well done! The mate there holds ye to it stiffly. He&rsquo;s no more afraid than the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic with storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes!</p>
<p>
	4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR He has his orders, mind ye that. I heard old Ahab tell him he must always kill a squall, something as they burst a waterspout with a pistol- fire your ship right into it!</p>
<p>
	ENGLISH SAILOR Blood! but that old man&rsquo;s a grand old cove! We are the lads to hunt him up his whale!</p>
<p>
	ALL Aye! aye!</p>
<p>
	OLD MANX SAILOR How the three pines shake! Pines are the hardest sort of tree to live when shifted to any other soil, and here there&rsquo;s none but the crew&rsquo;s cursed clay. Steady, helmsman! steady. This is the sort of weather when brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at sea. Our captain has his birthmark; look yonder, boys, there&rsquo;s another in the sky lurid- like, ye see, all else pitch black.</p>
<p>
	DAGGOO What of that? Who&rsquo;s afraid of black&rsquo;s afraid of me! I&rsquo;m quarried out of it!</p>
<p>
	SPANISH SAILOR (Aside.) He wants to bully, ah!- the old grudge makes me touchy (Advancing.) Aye, harpooneer, thy race is the undeniable dark side of mankind- devilish dark at that. No offence.</p>
<p>
	DAGGOO (Grimly) None.</p>
<p>
	ST. JAGO&rsquo;S SAILOR That Spaniard&rsquo;s mad or drunk. But that can&rsquo;t be, or else in his one case our old Mogul&rsquo;s fire-waters are somewhat long in working.</p>
<p>
	5TH NANTUCKET SAILOR What&rsquo;s that I saw- lightning? Yes.</p>
<p>
	SPANISH SAILOR No; Daggoo showing his teeth.</p>
<p>
	DAGGOO (Springing) Swallow thine, mannikin! White skin, white liver!</p>
<p>
	SPANISH SAILOR (Meeting him) Knife thee heartily! big frame, small spirit!</p>
<p>
	ALL A row! a row! a row!</p>
<p>
	TASHTEGO (With a whiff) A row a&rsquo;low, and a row aloft- Gods and men- both brawlers! Humph!</p>
<p>
	BELFAST SAILOR A row! arrah a row! The Virgin be blessed, a row! Plunge in with ye!</p>
<p>
	ENGLISH SAILOR Fair play! Snatch the Spaniard&rsquo;s knife! A ring, a ring!</p>
<p>
	OLD MANX SAILOR Ready formed. There! the ringed horizon. In that ring Cain struck Abel. Sweet work, right work! No? Why then, God, mad&rsquo;st thou the ring?</p>
<p>
	MATE&rsquo;S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK Hands by the halyards! in top-gallant sails! Stand by to reef topsails!</p>
<p>
	ALL The squall! the squall! jump, my jollies! (They scatter.)</p>
<p>
	PIP (Shrinking under the windlass) Jollies? Lord help such jollies! Crish, crash! there goes the jib-stay! Blang-whang! God! Duck lower, Pip, here comes the royal yard! It&rsquo;s worse than being in the whirled woods, the last day of the year! Who&rsquo;d go climbing after chestnuts now? But there they go, all cursing, and here I don&rsquo;t. Fine prospects to &lsquo;em; they&rsquo;re on the road to heaven. Hold on hard! Jimmini, what a squall! But those chaps there are worse yet- they are your white squalls, they. White squalls? white whale, shirr! shirr! Here have I heard all their chat just now, and the white whale- shirr! shirr!- but spoken of once! and only this evening- it makes me ingle all over like my tambourine- that anaconda of an old man swore &lsquo;em in to hunt him! Oh! thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on this small black boy down here; preserve him from all men that have no bowels to feel fear!</p>
