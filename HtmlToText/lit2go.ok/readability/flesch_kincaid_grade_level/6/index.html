	<em>Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz </em>is the fourth book set in the Land of Oz (though most of the action is outside of it) written by L. Frank Baum and illustrated by John R. Neill. It was published in 1908 and reunites Dorothy with the humbug Wizard from <em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</em>. This is one of only two of the original forty Oz books (with The Emerald City of Oz) to be illustrated with watercolor paintings.</p>            </article>

	The Emerald City of Oz is the sixth of L. Frank Baum&rsquo;s fourteen Land of Oz books. Originally published in 1910, it is the story of Dorothy and her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em coming to live in Oz permanently. While they tour through the Quadling Country, the Nome King assembles allies for an invasion of Oz.</p>
<p>
	Baum had intended to cease writing Oz stories with this book, but financial pressures prompted him to write and publish The Patchwork Girl of Oz, with seven other Oz books to follow.</p>            </article>

	<em>The Story of Siegfried </em>is James Baldwin&#39;s retelling of ancient yet perpetually popular Norse and Germanic tales about the hero Siegfried. The stories tell of a young man who had many adventures that readers might find familiar from modern movies and books, such as forging a legendary sword, rescuing a beautiful woman from a deep sleep, fighting dragons and armies, and so forth. Baldwin&#39;s sources included the Eddas, the Volsung Saga, and the Nibelungenlied, some of the oldest surviving references to the legends.</p>            </article>

	<em>Sylvie and Bruno,</em> first published in 1889, and its 1893 second volume <em>Sylvie and Bruno Concluded </em>form the last novel by Lewis Carroll published during his lifetime. Both volumes were illustrated by Harry Furniss.</p>
<p>
	The novel has two main plots: one set in the real world at the time the book was published (the Victorian era), the other in the fictional world of Fairyland. While the latter plot is a fairytale with many nonsense elements and poems, similar to Carroll&rsquo;s most famous children&rsquo;s book <em>Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland,</em> the story set in Victorian Britain is a social novel, with its characters discussing various concepts and aspects of religion, society, philosophy and morality.</p>            </article>

Set in the Trojan War, the ten-year siege of Ilium by a coalition of Greek states, it tells of the battles and events during the weeks of a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles. Although the story covers only a few weeks in the final year of the war, the Iliad mentions or alludes to many of the Greek legends about the siege.</p>            </article>

	<em>Sylvie and Bruno,</em> first published in 1889, and its 1893 second volume <em>Sylvie and Bruno Concluded</em> form the last novel by Lewis Carroll published during his lifetime. Both volumes were illustrated by Harry Furniss.</p>
<p>
	The novel has two main plots: one set in the real world at the time the book was published (the Victorian era), the other in the fictional world of Fairyland. While the latter plot is a fairytale with many nonsense elements and poems, similar to Carroll&rsquo;s most famous children&rsquo;s book <em>Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland,</em> the story set in Victorian Britain is a social novel, with its characters discussing various concepts and aspects of religion, society, philosophy and morality.</p>            </article>
