	<em>Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</em> is a work of children&rsquo;s literature by the English mathematician and author, Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, written under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit-hole into a fantasy realm populated by talking playing cards and anthropomorphic creatures. The tale is fraught with satirical allusions to Dodgson&rsquo;s friends and to the lessons that British schoolchildren were expected to memorize. The Wonderland described in the tale plays with logic in ways that has made the story of lasting popularity with children as well as adults. The book is often referred to by the abbreviated title <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. This alternate title was popularized by the numerous film and television adaptations of the story produced over the years. Some printings of this title contain both <em>Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</em> and its sequel <em>Through the Looking-Glass</em>, and <em>What Alice Found There</em>.</p>

	<em>The Red Badge of Courage</em> is an impressionistic novel by Stephen Crane about the meaning of courage, as it is narrated by Henry Fleming, a recruit in the American Civil War. It is one of the most influential American war stories ever written even though the author was born after the war and had never seen battle himself. Crane met and spoke with a number of veterans as a student and he created what is widely regarded as an unusually realistic depiction of a young man in battle.</p>            </article>
