                <p>
	The next visit I paid to Nancy Brown was in the second week in March: for, though I had many spare minutes during the day, I seldom could look upon an hour as entirely my own; since, where everything was left to the caprices of Miss Matilda and her sister, there could be no order or regularity. Whatever occupation I chose, when not actually busied about them or their concerns, I had, as it were, to keep my loins girded, my shoes on my feet, and my staff in my hand; for not to be immediately forthcoming when called for, was regarded as a grave and inexcusable offence: not only by my pupils and their mother, but by the very servant, who came in breathless haste to call me, exclaiming, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re to go to the schoolroom DIRECTLY, mum, the young ladies is WAITING!!&rsquo; Climax of horror! Actually waiting for their governess!!!</p>
<p>
	But this time I was pretty sure of an hour or two to myself; for Matilda was preparing for a long ride, and Rosalie was dressing for a dinner&ndash;party at Lady Ashby&rsquo;s: so I took the opportunity of repairing to the widow&rsquo;s cottage, where I found her in some anxiety about her cat, which had been absent all day. I comforted her with as many anecdotes of that animal&rsquo;s roving propensities as I could recollect. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m feared o&rsquo; th&rsquo; gamekeepers,&rsquo; said she: &lsquo;that&rsquo;s all &lsquo;at I think on. If th&rsquo; young gentlemen had been at home, I should a&rsquo; thought they&rsquo;d been setting their dogs at her, an&rsquo; worried her, poor thing, as they did MANY a poor thing&rsquo;s cat; but I haven&rsquo;t that to be feared on now.&rsquo; Nancy&rsquo;s eyes were better, but still far from well: she had been trying to make a Sunday shirt for her son, but told me she could only bear to do a little bit at it now and then, so that it progressed but slowly, though the poor lad wanted it sadly. So I proposed to help her a little, after I had read to her, for I had plenty of time that evening, and need not return till dusk. She thankfully accepted the offer. &lsquo;An&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll be a bit o&rsquo; company for me too, Miss,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;I like as I feel lonesome without my cat.&rsquo; But when I had finished reading, and done the half of a seam, with Nancy&rsquo;s capacious brass thimble fitted on to my finger by means of a roll of paper, I was disturbed by the entrance of Mr. Weston, with the identical cat in his arms. I now saw that he could smile, and very pleasantly too.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done you a piece of good service, Nancy,&rsquo; he began: then seeing me, he acknowledged my presence by a slight bow. I should have been invisible to Hatfield, or any other gentleman of those parts. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve delivered your cat,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;from the hands, or rather the gun, of Mr. Murray&rsquo;s gamekeeper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;God bless you, sir!&rsquo; cried the grateful old woman, ready to weep for joy as she received her favourite from his arms.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Take care of it,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and don&rsquo;t let it go near the rabbit&ndash;warren, for the gamekeeper swears he&rsquo;ll shoot it if he sees it there again: he would have done so to&ndash;day, if I had not been in time to stop him. I believe it is raining, Miss Grey,&rsquo; added he, more quietly, observing that I had put aside my work, and was preparing to depart. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let me disturb you&mdash;I shan&rsquo;t stay two minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll BOTH stay while this shower gets owered,&rsquo; said Nancy, as she stirred the fire, and placed another chair beside it; &lsquo;What! There&rsquo;s room for all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I can see better here, thank you, Nancy,&rsquo; replied I, taking my work to the window, where she had the goodness to suffer me to remain unmolested, while she got a brush to remove the cat&rsquo;s hairs from Mr. Weston&rsquo;s coat, carefully wiped the rain from his hat, and gave the cat its supper, busily talking all the time: now thanking her clerical friend for what he had done; now wondering how the cat had found out the warren; and now lamenting the probable consequences of such a discovery. He listened with a quiet, good&ndash;natured smile, and at length took a seat in compliance with her pressing invitations, but repeated that he did not mean to stay.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I have another place to go to,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and I see&rsquo; (glancing at the book on the table) &lsquo;someone else has been reading to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Yes, sir; Miss Grey has been as kind as read me a chapter; an&rsquo; now she&rsquo;s helping me with a shirt for our Bill&mdash;but I&rsquo;m feared she&rsquo;ll be cold there. Won&rsquo;t you come to th&rsquo; fire, Miss?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;No, thank you, Nancy, I&rsquo;m quite warm. I must go as soon as this shower is over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Oh, Miss! You said you could stop while dusk!&rsquo; cried the provoking old woman, and Mr. Weston seized his hat.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Nay, sir,&rsquo; exclaimed she, &lsquo;pray don&rsquo;t go now, while it rains so fast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;But it strikes me I&rsquo;m keeping your visitor away from the fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;No, you&rsquo;re not, Mr. Weston,&rsquo; replied I, hoping there was no harm in a falsehood of that description.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;No, sure!&rsquo; cried Nancy. &lsquo;What, there&rsquo;s lots o&rsquo; room!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Miss Grey,&rsquo; said he, half&ndash;jestingly, as if he felt it necessary to change the present subject, whether he had anything particular to say or not, &lsquo;I wish you would make my peace with the squire, when you see him. He was by when I rescued Nancy&rsquo;s cat, and did not quite approve of the deed. I told him I thought he might better spare all his rabbits than she her cat, for which audacious assertion he treated me to some rather ungentlemanly language; and I fear I retorted a trifle too warmly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Oh, lawful sir! I hope you didn&rsquo;t fall out wi&rsquo; th&rsquo; maister for sake o&rsquo; my cat! he cannot bide answering again&mdash;can th&rsquo; maister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s no matter, Nancy: I don&rsquo;t care about it, really; I said nothing VERY uncivil; and I suppose Mr. Murray is accustomed to use rather strong language when he&rsquo;s heated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Ay, sir: it&rsquo;s a pity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;And now, I really must go. I have to visit a place a mile beyond this; and you would not have me to return in the dark: besides, it has nearly done raining now&mdash;so good&ndash;evening, Nancy. Good&ndash;evening, Miss Grey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Good&ndash;evening, Mr. Weston; but don&rsquo;t depend upon me for making your peace with Mr. Murray, for I never see him&mdash;to speak to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you; it can&rsquo;t be helped then,&rsquo; replied he, in dolorous resignation: then, with a peculiar half&ndash;smile, he added, &lsquo;But never mind; I imagine the squire has more to apologise for than I;&rsquo; and left the cottage.</p>
<p>
	I went on with my sewing as long as I could see, and then bade Nancy good&ndash;evening; checking her too lively gratitude by the undeniable assurance that I had only done for her what she would have done for me, if she had been in my place and I in hers. I hastened back to Horton Lodge, where, having entered the schoolroom, I found the tea&ndash;table all in confusion, the tray flooded with slops, and Miss Matilda in a most ferocious humour.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Miss Grey, whatever have you been about? I&rsquo;ve had tea half an hour ago, and had to make it myself, and drink it all alone! I wish you would come in sooner!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been to see Nancy Brown. I thought you would not be back from your ride.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;How could I ride in the rain, I should like to know. That damned pelting shower was vexatious enough&mdash;coming on when I was just in full swing: and then to come and find nobody in to tea! and you know I can&rsquo;t make the tea as I like it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of the shower,&rsquo; replied I (and, indeed, the thought of its driving her home had never entered my head).</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;No, of course; you were under shelter yourself, and you never thought of other people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	I bore her coarse reproaches with astonishing equanimity, even with cheerfulness; for I was sensible that I had done more good to Nancy Brown than harm to her: and perhaps some other thoughts assisted to keep up my spirits, and impart a relish to the cup of cold, overdrawn tea, and a charm to the otherwise unsightly table; and&mdash;I had almost said&mdash;to Miss Matilda&rsquo;s unamiable face. But she soon betook herself to the stables, and left me to the quiet enjoyment of my solitary meal.</p>
