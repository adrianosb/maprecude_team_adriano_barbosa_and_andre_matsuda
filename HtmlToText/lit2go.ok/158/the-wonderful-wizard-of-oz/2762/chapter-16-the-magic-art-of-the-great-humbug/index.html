                <p>
	Next morning the Scarecrow said to his friends:</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Congratulate me. I am going to Oz to get my brains at last. When I return I shall be as other men are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I have always liked you as you were,&rdquo; said Dorothy simply.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But surely you will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain is going to turn out.&rdquo; Then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful voice and went to the Throne Room, where he rapped upon the door.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Oz.</p>
<p>
	The Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the window, engaged in deep thought.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I have come for my brains,&rdquo; remarked the Scarecrow, a little uneasily.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please,&rdquo; replied Oz. &ldquo;You must excuse me for taking your head off, but I shall have to do it in order to put your brains in their proper place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the Scarecrow. &ldquo;You are quite welcome to take my head off, as long as it will be a better one when you put it on again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	So the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw. Then he entered the back room and took up a measure of bran, which he mixed with a great many pins and needles. Having shaken them together thoroughly, he filled the top of the Scarecrow&rsquo;s head with the mixture and stuffed the rest of the space with straw, to hold it in place.</p>
<p>
	When he had fastened the Scarecrow&rsquo;s head on his body again he said to him, &ldquo;Hereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot of bran-new brains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his greatest wish, and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his friends.</p>
<p>
	Dorothy looked at him curiously. His head was quite bulged out at the top with brains.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I feel wise indeed,&rdquo; he answered earnestly. &ldquo;When I get used to my brains I shall know everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head?&rdquo; asked the Tin Woodman.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;That is proof that he is sharp,&rdquo; remarked the Lion.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, I must go to Oz and get my heart,&rdquo; said the Woodman. So he walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; called Oz, and the Woodman entered and said, &ldquo;I have come for my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered the little man. &ldquo;But I shall have to cut a hole in your breast, so I can put your heart in the right place. I hope it won&rsquo;t hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<br />
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; answered the Woodman. &ldquo;I shall not feel it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	So Oz brought a pair of tinsmith&rsquo;s shears and cut a small, square hole in the left side of the Tin Woodman&rsquo;s breast. Then, going to a chest of drawers, he took out a pretty heart, made entirely of silk and stuffed with sawdust.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a beauty?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It is, indeed!&rdquo; replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased. &ldquo;But is it a kind heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, very!&rdquo; answered Oz. He put the heart in the Woodman&rsquo;s breast and then replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together where it had been cut.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;now you have a heart that any man might be proud of. I&rsquo;m sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, but it really couldn&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Never mind the patch,&rdquo; exclaimed the happy Woodman. &ldquo;I am very grateful to you, and shall never forget your kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it,&rdquo; replied Oz.</p>
<p>
	Then the Tin Woodman went back to his friends, who wished him every joy on account of his good fortune.</p>
<p>
	The Lion now walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Oz.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I have come for my courage,&rdquo; announced the Lion, entering the room.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered the little man; &ldquo;I will get it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle, the contents of which he poured into a green-gold dish, beautifully carved. Placing this before the Cowardly Lion, who sniffed at it as if he did not like it, the Wizard said:</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the Lion.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Oz, &ldquo;if it were inside of you, it would be courage. You know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it. Therefore I advise you to drink it as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The Lion hesitated no longer, but drank till the dish was empty.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;How do you feel now?&rdquo; asked Oz.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Full of courage,&rdquo; replied the Lion, who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune.</p>
<p>
	Oz, left to himself, smiled to think of his success in giving the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought they wanted. &ldquo;How can I help being a humbug,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when all these people make me do things that everybody knows can&rsquo;t be done? It was easy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy, because they imagined I could do anything. But it will take more than imagination to carry Dorothy back to Kansas, and I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know how it can be done.&rdquo;</p>
