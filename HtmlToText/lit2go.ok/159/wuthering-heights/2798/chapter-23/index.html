                <p>
	THE RAINY NIGHT had ushered in a cold, misty morning&mdash;half-frost, half-drizzle&mdash;and temporary brooks crossed our path, gurgling from the uplands. My feet were thoroughly wetted; I was cross and low; exactly the humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things. We entered the farmhouse by the kitchen way, to ascertain whether Mr. Heathcliff were really absent; because I put slight faith in his own affirmation.</p>
<p>
	Joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone, beside a roaring fire; a quart of ale on the table near him, bristling with large pieces of toasted oat-cake; and his black, short pipe in his mouth. Catherine ran to the hearth to warm herself I asked if the master was in? My question remained so long unanswered, that I thought the old man had grown deaf, and repeated it louder.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Na-ay!&rdquo; he snarled, or rather screamed through his nose. &ldquo;Na-ay! yah muh goa back whear yah coom frough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Joseph!&rdquo; cried a peevish voice, simultaneously with me, from the inner room. &ldquo;How often am I to call you? There are only a few red ashes now. Joseph! come this moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Vigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate declared he had no ear for this appeal. The housekeeper and Hareton were invisible; one gone on an errand, and the other at his work, probably. We knew Linton&rsquo;s tones, and entered.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, I hope you&rsquo;ll die in a garret! starved to death,&rdquo; said the boy, mistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant.</p>
<p>
	He stopped, on observing his error; his cousin flew to him.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Is that you, Miss Linton?&rdquo; he said, raising his head from the arm of the great chair, in which he reclined. &ldquo;No&mdash;don&rsquo;t kiss me: it takes my breath. Dear me! papa said you would call,&rdquo; continued he, after recovering a little from Catherine&rsquo;s embrace; while she stood by looking very contrite. &ldquo;Will you shut the door, if you please? you left it open; and those&mdash;those detestable creatures won&rsquo;t bring coals to the fire. It&rsquo;s so cold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I stirred up the cinders, and fetched a scuttleful myself. The invalid complained of being covered with ashes; but he had a tiresome cough, and looked feverish and ill, so I did not rebuke his temper.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, Linton,&rdquo; murmured Catherine, when his corrugated brow relaxed. &ldquo;Are you glad to see me? Can I do you any good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come before?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You should have come, instead of writing. It tired me dreadfully, writing those long letters. I&rsquo;d far rather have talked to you. Now, I can neither bear to talk, nor anything else. I wonder where Zillah is! Will you (looking at me) step into the kitchen and see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I had received no thanks for my other service; and being unwilling to run to and fro at his behest, I replied: &ldquo;Nobody is out there but Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I want to drink,&rdquo; he exclaimed fretfully, turning away. &ldquo;Zillah is constantly gadding off to Gimmerton since papa went: it&rsquo;s miserable! And I&rsquo;m obliged to come down here&mdash;they resolved never to hear me upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Is your father attentive to you, Master Heathcliff?&rdquo; I asked, perceiving Catherine to be checked in her friendly advances.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Attentive? He makes them a little more attentive at least,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The wretches! Do you know, Miss Linton, that brute Hareton laughs at me! I hate him! indeed, I hate them all: they are odious beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Cathy began searching for some water; she lighted on a pitcher in the dresser, filled a tumbler, and brought it. He bid her add a spoonful of wine from a bottle on the table; and having swallowed a small portion, appeared more tranquil, and said she was very kind.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And are you glad to see me?&rdquo; asked she, reiterating her former question, and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes, I am. It&rsquo;s something new to hear a voice like yours!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But I have been vexed, because you wouldn&rsquo;t come. And papa swore it was owing to me: he called me a pitiful, shuffling, worthless thing; and said you despised me; and if he had been in my place, he would be more the master of the Grange than your father, by this time. But you don&rsquo;t despise me do you, Miss-&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I wish you would say Catherine, or Cathy,&rdquo; interrupted my young lady. &ldquo;Despise you? No! Next to papa and Ellen, I love you better than anybody living. I don&rsquo;t love Mr. Heathcliff, though; and I dare not come when he returns; will he stay away many days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Not many,&rdquo; answered Linton; &ldquo;but he goes on to the moors frequently, since the shooting season commenced; and you might spend an hour or two with me in his absence. Do say you will. I think I should not be peevish with you: you&rsquo;d not provoke me, and you&rsquo;d always be ready to help me, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Catherine, stroking his long soft hair; &ldquo;if I could only get papa&rsquo;s consent, I&rsquo;d spend half my time with you. Pretty Linton! I wish you were my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And then you would like me as well as your father?&rdquo; observed he, more cheerfully. &ldquo;But papa says you would love me better than him and all the world, if you were my wife; so I&rsquo;d rather you were that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No I should never love anybody better than papa,&rdquo; she returned gravely. &ldquo;And people hate their wives, sometimes; but not their sisters and brothers: and if you were the latter you would live with us, and papa would be as fond of you as he is of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Linton denied that people ever hated their wives; but Cathy affirmed they did, and, in her wisdom, instanced his own father&rsquo;s aversion to her aunt. I endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue. I couldn&rsquo;t succeed till everything she knew was out. Master Heathcliff, much irritated, asserted her relation was false.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Papa told me; and papa does not tell falsehoods,&rdquo; she answered pertly:</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;My papa scorns yours!&rdquo; cried Linton. &ldquo;He calls him a sneaking fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yours is a wicked man,&rdquo; retorted Catherine; &ldquo;and you are very naughty to dare to repeat what he says. He must be wicked to have made Aunt Isabella leave him as she did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t leave him,&rdquo; said the boy; &ldquo;you shan&rsquo;t contradict me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;She did,&rdquo; cried my young lady.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you something!&rdquo; said Linton. &ldquo;Your mother hated your father: now then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Catherine, too enraged to continue.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And she loved mine,&rdquo; added he.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You little liar! I hate you now!&rdquo; she panted, and her face grew red with passion.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;She did! she did!&rdquo; sang Linton, sinking into the recess of his chair, and leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other disputant, who stood behind.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Hush, Master Heathcliff!&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s your father&rsquo;s tale, too, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t: you hold your tongue!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;She did, she did, Catherine! she did, she did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Cathy, beside herself, gave the chair a violent push, and caused him to fall against one arm. He was immediately seized by a suffocating cough that soon ended his triumph. It lasted so long that it frightened even me. As to his cousin, she wept, with all her might; aghast at the mischief she had done: though she said nothing. I held him till the fit exhausted itself. Then he thrust me away, and leant his head down silently. Catherine quelled her lamentations also, took a seat opposite, and looked solemnly into the fire.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;How do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?&rdquo; I enquired, after waiting ten minutes.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I wish she felt as I do,&rdquo; he replied: &ldquo;spiteful, cruel thing! Hareton never touches me: he never struck me in his life. And I was better today: and there-&rdquo; his voice died in a whimper.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t strike you!&rdquo; muttered Cathy, chewing her lip to prevent another burst of emotion.</p>
<p>
	He sighed and moaned like one under great suffering, and kept it up for a quarter of an hour; on purpose to distress his cousin apparently, for whenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and pathos into the inflections of his voice.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I hurt you, Linton,&rdquo; she said at length racked beyond endurance. &ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t have been hurt by that little push, and I had no idea that you could, either: you&rsquo;re not much, are you, Linton? Don&rsquo;t let me go home thinking I&rsquo;ve done you harm. Answer! speak to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak to you,&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve hurt me so, that I shall lie awake all night choking with this cough. If you had it you&rsquo;d know what it was; but you&rsquo;ll be comfortably asleep while I&rsquo;m in agony, and nobody near me. I wonder how you would like to pass those fearful nights!&rdquo; And he began to wall aloud, for very pity of himself.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t be miss who spoils your ease: you&rsquo;d be the same had she never come. However, she shall not disturb you again; and perhaps you&rsquo;ll get quieter when we leave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Must I go?&rdquo; asked Catherine dolefully, bending over him. &ldquo;Do you want me to go, Linton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t alter what you&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; he replied pettishly, shrinking from her, &ldquo;unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, then, I must go?&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Let me alone, at least,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear your talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She lingered, and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome while; but as he neither looked up nor spoke, she finally made a movement to the door and I followed. We were recalled by a scream. Linton had slid from his seat on to the hearthstone, and lay writhing in the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a child, determined to be as grievous and harassing as it can. I thoroughly gauged his disposition from his behaviour, and saw at once it would be folly to attempt humouring him. Not so my companion: she ran back in terror, knelt down, and cried, and soothed, and entreated, till he grew quiet from lack of breath: by no means from compunction at distressng her.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I shall lift him on the settle,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and he may roll about as he pleases: we can&rsquo;t stop to watch him. I hope you are satisfied, Miss Cathy, that you are not the person to benefit him; and that his condition of health is not occasioned by attachment to you. Now, then, there he is! Come away: as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care for his nonsense, he&rsquo;ll be glad to lie still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She placed a cushion under his head, and offered him some water; he rejected the latter, and tossed uneasily on the former, as if it were a stone or a block of wood. She tried to put it more comfortably.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do with that,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not high enough.&rdquo; Catherine brought another to lay above it.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too high,&rdquo; murmured the provoking thing.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;How must I arrange it, then?&rdquo; she asked despairingly.</p>
<p>
	He twined himself up to her, as she half knelt by the settle, and converted her shoulder into a support.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No, that won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be content with the cushion, Master Heathcliff. Miss has wasted too much time on you already: we cannot remain five minutes longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes, yes, we can!&rdquo; replied Cathy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s good and patient now. He&rsquo;s beginning to think I shall have far greater misery than he will tonight, if I believed he is the worse for my visit; and then I dare not come again. Tell the truth about it, Linton; for I mustn&rsquo;t come, if I have hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You must come, to cure me,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You ought to come, because you have hurt me: you know you have extremely! I was not as ill when you entered as I am at present&mdash;was I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it at all,&rdquo; said his cousin. &ldquo;However, we&rsquo;ll be friends now. And you want me: you would wish to see me sometimes, really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I told you I did,&rdquo; he replied impatiently. &ldquo;Sit on the settle and let me lean on your knee. That&rsquo;s as mamma used to do, whole afternoons together. Sit quite still and don&rsquo;t talk: but you may sing a song, if you can sing; or you may say a nice long interesting ballad&mdash;one of those you promised to teach me: or a story. I&rsquo;d rather have a ballad, though: begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Catherine repeated the longest she could remember. The employment pleased both mightily. Linton would have another; and after that another, notwithstanding my strenuous objections; and so they went on until the clock struck twelve, and we heard Hareton in the court, returning for his dinner.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And to-morrow, Catherine, will you be here to-morrow?&rdquo; asked young Heathcliff, holding her frock as she rose reluctantly.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;nor the next day.&rdquo; She, however, gave a different response evidently, for his forehead cleared as she stooped and whispered in his ear.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go to-morrow, recollect, miss!&rdquo; I commenced, when we were out of the house. &ldquo;You are not dreaming of it, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She smiled.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll take good care,&rdquo; I continued: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have that lock mended, and you can escape by no way else&rdquo;.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I can get over the wall,&rdquo; she said, laughing. &ldquo;The Grange is not a prison, Ellen, and you are not my gaoler. And besides, I&rsquo;m almost seventeen: I&rsquo;m a woman. And I&rsquo;m certain Linton would recover quickly if he had me to look after him. I&rsquo;m older than he is, you know, and wiser: less childish, am I not? And he&rsquo;ll soon do as I direct him, with some slight coaxing. He&rsquo;s a pretty little darling when he&rsquo;s good. I&rsquo;d make such a pet of him, if he were mine. We should never quarrel, should we, after we were used to each other? Don&rsquo;t you like him, Ellen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Like him!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;The worst-tempered bit of a sickly slip that ever struggled into its teens. Happily, as Mr. Heathcliff conjectured, he&rsquo;ll not win twenty. I doubt whether he&rsquo;ll see spring, indeed. And small loss to his family whenever he drops off. And lucky it is for us that his father took him: the kinder he was treated, the more tedious and selfish he&rsquo;d be. I&rsquo;m glad you have no chance of having him for a husband, Miss Catherine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	My companion waxed serious at hearing this speech. To speak of his death so regardlessly, wounded her feelings.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He&rsquo;s younger than I,&rdquo; she answered, after a protracted pause of meditation, &ldquo;and he ought to live the longest: he will&mdash;he must live as long as I do. He&rsquo;s as strong now as when he first came into the north; I&rsquo;m positive of that. It&rsquo;s only a cold that ails him, the same as papa has. You say papa will get better, and why shouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;after all, we needn&rsquo;t trouble ourselves; for listen, miss, and mind, I&rsquo;ll keep my word,&mdash;if you attempt going to Wuthering Heights again, with or without me, I shall inform Mr. Linton, and, unless he allow it, intimacy with your cousin must not be revived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It has been revived,&rdquo; muttered Cathy sulkily.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Must not be continued, then,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; was her reply, and she set off at a gallop, leaving me to toil in the rear.</p>
<p>
	We both reached home before our dinner-time; my master supposed we had been wandering through the park, and therefore he demanded no explanation of our absence. As soon as I entered, I hastened to change my soaked shoes and stockings; but sitting such a while at the Heights had done the mischief On the succeeding morning I was laid up, and during three weeks I remained incapacitated for attending to my duties: a calamity never experienced prior to that period, and never, I am thankful to say, since.</p>
<p>
	My little mistress behaved like an angel, in coming to wait on me, and cheer my solitude: the confinement brought me exceedingly low. It is wearisome, to a stirring active body: but few have slighter reasons for complaint than I had. The moment Catherine left Mr. Linton&rsquo;s room, she appeared at my bedside. Her day was divided between us; no amusement usurped a minute: she neglected her meals, her studies, and her play; and she was the fondest nurse that ever watched. She must have had a warm heart, when she loved her father so, to give so much to me. I said her days were divided between us; but the master retired early, and I generally needed nothing after six o&rsquo;clock; thus the evening was her own. Poor thing! I never considered what she did with herself after tea. And though frequently, when she looked in to bid me good-night, I remarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender fingers; instead of fancying the hue borrowed from a cold ride across the moors, I laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library.</p>
