	______________</p>
<p>
	Extract a Pair of Premisses out of each of the following: and deduce the Conclusion, if there is one:--</p>
<p>
	92. &quot;The Lion, as any one can tell you who has been chased by them as often as I have, is a very savage animal: and there are certain individuals among them, though I will not guarantee it as a general law, who do not drink coffee.&quot;</p>
<p>
	93. &quot;It was most absurd of you to offer it! You might have known, if you had had any sense, that no old sailors ever like gruel!&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;But I thought, as he was an uncle of yours--&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;An uncle of mine, indeed! Stuff!&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;You may call it stuff, if you like. All I know is, MY uncles are all old men: and they like gruel like anything!&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Well, then YOUR uncles are--&quot;</p>
<p>
	94. &quot;Do come away! I can&#39;t stand this squeezing any more. No crowded shops are comfortable, you know very well.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Well, who expects to be comfortable, out shopping?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Why, I do, of course! And I&#39;m sure there are some shops, further down the street, that are not crowded. So--&quot;</p>
<p>
	95. &quot;They say no doctors are metaphysical organists: and that lets me into a little fact about YOU, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Why, how do you make THAT out? You never heard me play the organ.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;No, doctor, but I&#39;ve heard you talk about Browning&#39;s poetry: and that showed me that you&#39;re METAPHYSICAL, at any rate. So--&quot;</p>
<p>
	___________________</p>
<p>
	Extract a Syllogism out of each of the following: and test its correctness:--</p>
<p>
	96. &quot;Don&#39;t talk to me! I&#39;ve known more rich merchants than you have: and I can tell you not ONE of them was ever an old miser since the world began!&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;And what has that got to do with old Mr. Brown?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Why, isn&#39;t he very rich?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Yes, of course he is. And what then?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Why, don&#39;t you see that it&#39;s absurd to call him a miserly merchant? Either he&#39;s not a merchant, or he&#39;s not a miser!&quot;</p>
<p>
	97. &quot;It IS so kind of you to enquire! I&#39;m really feeling a great deal better to-day.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;And is it Nature, or Art, that is to have the credit of this happy change?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Art, I think. The Doctor has given me some of that patent medicine of his.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Well, I&#39;ll never call him a humbug again. There&#39;s SOMEBODY, at any rate, that feels better after taking his medicine!&quot;</p>
<p>
	98. &quot;No, I don&#39;t like you one bit. And I&#39;ll go and play with my doll. DOLLS are never unkind.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;So you like a doll better than a cousin? Oh you little silly!&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Of course I do! COUSINS are never kind--at least no cousins I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Well, and what does THAT prove, I&#39;d like to know! If you mean that cousins aren&#39;t dolls, who ever said they were?&quot;</p>
<p>
	99. &quot;What are you talking about geraniums for? You can&#39;t tell one flower from another, at this distance! I grant you they&#39;re all RED flowers: it doesn&#39;t need a telescope to know THAT.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Well, some geraniums are red, aren&#39;t they?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I don&#39;t deny it. And what then? I suppose you&#39;ll be telling me some of those flowers are geraniums!&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Of course that&#39;s what I should tell you, if you&#39;d the sense to follow an argument! But what&#39;s the good of proving anything to YOU, I should like to know?&quot;</p>
<p>
	100. &quot;Boys, you&#39;ve passed a fairly good examination, all things considered. Now let me give you a word of advice before I go. Remember that all, who are really anxious to learn, work HARD.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I thank you, Sir, in the name of my scholars! And proud am I to think there are SOME of them, at least, that are really ANXIOUS to learn.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Very glad to hear it: and how do you make it out to be so?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Why, Sir, I know how hard they work--some of them, that is. Who should know better?&quot;</p>
<p>

	Extract from the following speech a series of Syllogisms, or arguments having the form of Syllogisms: and test their correctness.</p>
<p>
	It is supposed to be spoken by a fond mother, in answer to a friend&#39;s cautious suggestion that she is perhaps a LITTLE overdoing it, in the way of lessons, with her children.</p>
<p>
	101. &quot;Well, they&#39;ve got their own way to make in the world. WE can&#39;t leave them a fortune apiece. And money&#39;s not to be had, as YOU know, without money&#39;s worth: they must WORK if they want to live. And how are they to work, if they don&#39;t know anything? Take my word for it, there&#39;s no place for ignorance in THESE times! And all authorities agree that the time to learn is when you&#39;re young. One&#39;s got no memory afterwards, worth speaking of. A child will learn more in an hour than a grown man in five. So those, that have to learn, must learn when they&#39;re young, if ever they&#39;re to learn at all. Of course that doesn&#39;t do unless children are HEALTHY: I quite allow THAT. Well, the doctor tells me no children are healthy unless they&#39;ve got a good colour in their cheeks. And only just look at my darlings! Why, their cheeks bloom like peonies! Well, now, they tell me that, to keep children in health, you should never give them more than six hours altogether at lessons in the day, and at least two half-holidays in the week. And that&#39;s EXACTLY our plan I can assure you! We never go beyond six hours, and every Wednesday and Saturday, as ever is, not one syllable of lessons do they do after their one o&#39;clock dinner! So how you can imagine I&#39;m running any risk in the education of my precious pets is more than I can understand, I promise you!&quot;</p>
<p>
	THE END.</p>
