                <p>
	Once upon a time there was a village shop. The name over the window was &ldquo;Ginger and Pickles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	It was a little small shop just the right size for Dolls&mdash; Lucinda and Jane Doll-cook always bought their groceries at Ginger and Pickles.</p>
<p>
	The counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits. Ginger and Pickles sold red spotty pocket handkerchiefs at a penny three farthings.</p>
<p>
	They also sold sugar, and snuff and galoshes.</p>
<p>
	In fact, although it was such a small shop it sold nearly everything&mdash;except a few things that you want in a hurry&mdash;like bootlaces, hair-pins and mutton chops.</p>
<p>
	Ginger and Pickles were the people who kept the shop. Ginger was a yellow tomcat, and Pickles was a terrier.</p>
<p>
	The rabbits were always a little bit afraid of Pickles.</p>
<p>
	The shop was also patronized by mice&mdash;only the mice were rather afraid of Ginger.</p>
<p>
	Ginger usually requested Pickles to serve them, because he said it made his mouth water.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I cannot bear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to see them going out at the door carrying their little parcels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I have the same feeling about rats,&rdquo; replied Pickles, &ldquo;but it would never do to eat our customers; they would leave us and go to Tabitha Twitchit&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;On the contrary, they would go nowhere,&rdquo; replied Ginger gloomily.</p>
<p>
	(Tabitha Twitchit kept the only other shop in the village. She did not give credit.)</p>
<p>
	But there is no money in what is called the &ldquo;till.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Ginger and Pickles gave unlimited credit.</p>
<p>
	Now the meaning of &ldquo;credit&rdquo; is this&mdash;when a customer buys a bar of soap, instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it &mdash;she says she will pay another time.</p>
<p>
	And Pickles makes a low bow and says, &ldquo;With pleasure, madam,&rdquo; and it is written down in a book.</p>
<p>
	The customers come again and again, and buy quantities, in spite of being afraid of Ginger and Pickles.</p>
<p>
	The customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities, especially the toffee customers. But there was always no money; they never paid for as much as a penny-worth of peppermints.</p>
<p>
	But the sales were enormous, ten times as large as Tabitha Twitchit&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>
	As there was always no money, Ginger and Pickles were obliged to eat their own goods.</p>
<p>
	Pickles ate biscuits and Ginger ate a dried haddock.</p>
<p>
	They ate them by candle-light after the shop was closed.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It is very uncomfortable, I am afraid I shall be summoned. I have tried in vain to get a license upon credit at the Post Office;&rdquo; said Pickles. &ldquo;The place is full of policemen. I met one as I was coming home.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Let us send in the bill again to Samuel Whiskers, Ginger, he owes 22/9 for bacon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I do not believe that he intends to pay at all,&rdquo; replied Ginger.</p>
<p>
	When it came to Jan. 1st there was still no money, and Pickles was unable to buy a dog license.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It is very unpleasant, I am afraid of the police,&rdquo; said Pickles.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It is your own fault for being a terrier; I do not require a license, and neither does Kep, the Collie dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And I feel sure that Anna Maria pockets things&mdash;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Where are all the cream crackers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You have eaten them yourself.&rdquo; replied Ginger.</p>
<p>
	Ginger and Pickles retired into the back parlor.</p>
<p>
	They did accounts. They added up sums and sums, and sums.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Samuel Whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail; he has had an ounce and three-quarters of snuff since October.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What is seven pounds of butter at 1/3, and a stick of sealing wax and four matches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Send in all the bills again to everybody &lsquo;with compliments,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied Ginger.</p>
<p>
	Pickles nearly had a fit, he barked and he barked and made little rushes.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Bite him, Pickles! Bite him!&rdquo; spluttered Ginger behind a sugar barrel, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only a German doll!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The policeman went on writing in his notebook; twice he put his pencil in his mouth, and once he dipped it in the treacle.</p>
<p>
	Pickles barked till he was hoarse. But still the policeman took no notice. He had bead eyes, and his helmet was sewed on with stitches.</p>
<p>
	After a time they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been pushed in at the door. They came out of the back parlor. There was an envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a notebook!</p>
<p>
	At length on his last little rush&mdash;Pickles found that the shop was empty. The policeman had disappeared.</p>
<p>
	But the envelope remained.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Do you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman? I am afraid it is a summons,&rdquo; said Pickles.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Ginger, who had opened the envelope, &ldquo;it is the rates and taxes, 3 pounds 19 11 3/4.&rdquo; [pounds are British money, the 19 is schillings, and then pence]</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;This is the last straw,&rdquo; said Pickles, &ldquo;let us close the shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	They put up the shutters, and left. But they have not removed from the neighborhood. In fact some people wish they had gone further.</p>
<p>
	Ginger is living in the warren [game preserve for rabbits]. I do not know what occupation he pursues; he looks stout and comfortable.</p>
<p>
	Pickles is at present a game-keeper.</p>
<p>
	After a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints and candles.</p>
<p>
	But they did not keep &ldquo;self-fitting sixes&rdquo;; and it takes five mice to carry one seven inch candle.</p>
<p>
	The closing of the shop caused great inconvenience. Tabitha Twitchit immediately raised the price of everything a halfpenny; and she continued to refuse to give credit.</p>
<p>
	Of course there are the tradesmen&rsquo;s carts&mdash;the butcher, the fishman and Timothy Baker.</p>
<p>
	But a person cannot live on &ldquo;seed wigs&rdquo; and sponge cake and butter buns&mdash;not even when the sponge cake is as good as Timothy&rsquo;s!</p>
<p>
	And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints.</p>
<p>
	And when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would say nothing but &ldquo;very snug;&rdquo; which is not the way to carry on a retail business.</p>
<p>
	Besides&mdash;the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather.</p>
<p>
	So everybody was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed poster to say that she was going to reopen the shop&mdash;&ldquo;Henny&rsquo;s Opening Sale! Grand cooperative Jumble! Penny&rsquo;s penny prices! Come buy, come try, come buy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The poster really was most &lsquo;ticing.</p>
<p>
	There was a rush upon the opening day. The shop was crammed with customers, and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit canisters.</p>
<p>
	Sally Henny Penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out change, and she insists on being paid cash; but she is quite harmless.</p>
<p>
	And she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains.</p>
<p>
	There is something to please everybody.</p>
