                <p>
	Once upon a time there was a very beautiful doll&rsquo;s-house; it was red brick with white windows, and it had real muslin curtains and a front door and a chimney.</p>
<p>
	It belonged to two dolls called Lucinda and Jane; at least it belonged to Lucinda, but she never ordered meals.</p>
<p>
	Jane was the Cook; but she never did any cooking, because the dinner had been bought ready-made, in a box full of shavings.</p>
<p>
	There were two red lobsters and a ham, a fish, a pudding, and some pears and oranges.</p>
<p>
	They would not come off the plates, but they were extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>
	One morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the doll&rsquo;s perambulator. There was no one in the nursery, and it was very quiet. Presently there was a little scuffling, scratching noise in a corner near the fireplace, where there was a hole under the skirting-board.</p>
<p>
	Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment, and then popped it in again. Tom Thumb was a mouse.</p>
<p>
	A minute afterwards, Hunca Munca, his wife, put her head out, too; and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery, she ventured out on the oilcloth under the coal-box.</p>
<p>
	The doll&rsquo;s-house stood at the other side of the fire-place. Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went cautiously across the hearthrug. They pushed the front door&mdash;it was not fast.</p>
<p>
	Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went upstairs and peeped into the dining-room. Then they squeaked with joy!</p>
<p>
	Such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table! There were tin spoons, and lead knives and forks, and two dolly-chairs&mdash;all SO convenient!</p>
<p>
	Tom Thumb set to work at once to carve the ham. It was a beautiful shiny yellow, streaked with red.</p>
<p>
	The knife crumpled up and hurt him; he put his finger in his mouth.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It is not boiled enough; it is hard. You have a try, Hunca Munca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Hunca Munca stood up in her chair, and chopped at the ham with another lead knife.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Hunca Munca.</p>
<p>
	The ham broke off the plate with a jerk, and rolled under the table.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Let it alone,&rdquo; said Tom Thumb; &ldquo;give me some fish, Hunca Munca!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Hunca Munca tried every tin spoon in turn; the fish was glued to the dish.</p>
<p>
	Then Tom Thumb lost his temper. He put the ham in the middle of the floor, and hit it with the tongs and with the shovel&mdash;bang, bang, smash, smash!</p>
<p>
	The ham flew all into pieces, for underneath the shiny paint it was made of nothing but plaster!</p>
<p>
	Then there was no end to the rage and disappointment of Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca. They broke up the pudding, the lobsters, the pears and the oranges.</p>
<p>
	As the fish would not come off the plate, they put it into the red-hot crinkly paper fire in the kitchen; but it would not burn either.</p>
<p>
	Tom Thumb went up the kitchen chimney and looked out at the top&mdash; there was no soot.</p>
<p>
	While Tom Thumb was up the chimney, Hunca Munca had another disappointment. She found some tiny canisters upon the dresser, labeled&mdash; Rice&mdash;Coffee&mdash;Sago&mdash;but when she turned them upside down, there was nothing inside except red and blue beads.</p>
<p>
	Then those mice set to work to do all the mischief they could&mdash;especially Tom Thumb! He took Jane&rsquo;s clothes out of the chest of drawers in her bedroom, and he threw them out of the top floor window.</p>
<p>
	But Hunca Munca had a frugal mind. After pulling half the feathers out of Lucinda&rsquo;s bolster, she remembered that she herself was in want of a feather bed.</p>
<p>
	With Tom Thumbs&rsquo;s assistance she carried the bolster downstairs, and across the hearth-rug. It was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the mouse-hole; but they managed it somehow.</p>
<p>
	Then Hunca Munca went back and fetched a chair, a book-case, a bird-cage, and several small odds and ends. The book-case and the bird-cage refused to go into the mousehole.</p>
<p>
	Hunca Munca left them behind the coal-box, and went to fetch a cradle.</p>
<p>
	Hunca Munca was just returning with another chair, when suddenly there was a noise of talking outside upon the landing. The mice rushed back to their hole, and the dolls came into the nursery.</p>
<p>
	What a sight met the eyes of Jane and Lucinda! Lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared; and Jane leant against the kitchen dresser and smiled&mdash;but neither of them made any remark.</p>
<p>
	The book-case and the bird-cage were rescued from under the coal-box&mdash;but Hunca Munca has got the cradle, and some of Lucinda&rsquo;s clothes.</p>
<p>
	She also has some useful pots and pans, and several other things.</p>
<p>
	The little girl that the doll&rsquo;s-house belonged to, said,&mdash;&ldquo;I will get a doll dressed like a policeman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	But the nurse said,&mdash;&ldquo;I will set a mouse-trap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	So that is the story of the two Bad Mice,&mdash;but they were not so very very naughty after all, because Tom Thumb paid for everything he broke.</p>
<p>
	He found a crooked sixpence under the hearth-rug; and upon Christmas Eve, he and Hunca Munca stuffed it into one of the stockings of Lucinda and Jane.</p>
<p>
	And very early every morning&mdash; before anybody is awake&mdash;Hunca Munca comes with her dust-pan and her broom to sweep the dollies&rsquo; house!</p>
