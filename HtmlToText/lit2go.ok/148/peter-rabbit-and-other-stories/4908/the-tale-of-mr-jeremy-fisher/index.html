                <p>
	Once upon a time there was a frog called Mr. Jeremy Fisher; he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond.</p>
<p>
	The water was all slippy-sloppy in the larder and in the back passage.</p>
<p>
	But Mr. Jeremy liked getting his feet wet; nobody ever scolded him, and he never caught a cold!</p>
<p>
	He was quite pleased when he looked out and saw large drops of rain, splashing in the pond&mdash;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I will get some worms and go fishing and catch a dish of minnows for my dinner,&rdquo; said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. &ldquo;If I catch more than five fish, I will invite my friends Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newton. The Alderman, however, eats salad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Mr. Jeremy put on a mackintosh, and a pair of shiny galoshes; he took his rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept his boat.</p>
<p>
	The boat was round and green, and very like the other lily-leaves. It was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond.</p>
<p>
	Mr. Jeremy took a reed pole, and pushed the boat out into open water. &ldquo;I know a good place for minnows,&rdquo; said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.</p>
<p>
	Mr. Jeremy stuck his pole into the mud and fastened the boat to it.</p>
<p>
	Then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged his fishing tackle. He had the dearest little red float. His rod was a tough stalk of grass, his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end.</p>
<p>
	The rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the float.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;This is getting tiresome, I think I should like some lunch,&rdquo; said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.</p>
<p>
	He punted back again amongst the water-plants, and took some lunch out of his basket.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I will eat a butterfly sandwich, and wait till the shower is over,&rdquo; said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.</p>
<p>
	A great big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the toe of one of his galoshes.</p>
<p>
	Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating his sandwich.</p>
<p>
	Once or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst the rushes at the side of the pond.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I trust that is not a rat,&rdquo; said Mr. Jeremy Fisher; &ldquo;I think I had better get away from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Mr. Jeremy shoved the boat out again a little way, and dropped in the bait. There was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous bobbit!</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A minnow! A minnow! I have him by the nose!&rdquo; cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher, jerking up his rod.</p>
<p>
	But what a horrible surprise! Instead of a smooth fat minnow, Mr. Jeremy landed little Jack Sharp, the stickleback, covered with spines!</p>
<p>
	The stickleback floundered about the boat, pricking and snapping until he was quite out of breath. Then he jumped back into the water.</p>
<p>
	And a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out, and laughed at Mr. Jeremy Fisher.</p>
<p>
	And while Mr. Jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat&mdash;sucking his sore fingers and peering down into the water&mdash;a MUCH worse thing happened; a really FRIGHTFUL thing it would have been, if Mr. Jeremy had not been wearing a mackintosh!</p>
<p>
	A great big enormous trout came up&mdash;ker-pflop-p-p-p! with a splash&mdash; and it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap, &ldquo;Ow! Ow! Ow!&rdquo;&mdash;and then it turned and dived down to the bottom of the pond!</p>
<p>
	But the trout was so displeased with the taste of the mackintosh, that in less than half a minute it spat him out again; and the only thing it swallowed was Mr. Jeremy&rsquo;s galoshes.</p>
<p>
	Mr. Jeremy bounced up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle; and he swam with all his might to the edge of the pond.</p>
<p>
	He scrambled out on the first bank he came to, and he hopped home across the meadow with his mackintosh all in tatters.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What a mercy that was not a pike!&rdquo; said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. &ldquo;I have lost my rod and basket; but it does not much matter, for I am sure I should never have dared to go fishing again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came to dinner. He could not offer them fish, but he had something else in his larder.</p>
<p>
	Sir Isaac Newton wore his black and gold waistcoat.</p>
<p>
	And Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag.</p>
<p>
	And instead of a nice dish of minnows, they had a roasted grasshopper with lady-bird sauce, which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but I think it must have been nasty!</p>
