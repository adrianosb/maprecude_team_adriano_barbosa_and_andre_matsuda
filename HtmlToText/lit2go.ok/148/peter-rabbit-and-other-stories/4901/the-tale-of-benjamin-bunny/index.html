                <p>
	One morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.</p>
<p>
	He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.</p>
<p>
	A gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.</p>
<p>
	As soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road, and set off&mdash;with a hop, skip, and a jump&mdash;to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor&rsquo;s garden.</p>
<p>
	That wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all lived Benjamin&rsquo;s aunt and his cousins&mdash;Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.</p>
<p>
	Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar). She also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender).</p>
<p>
	Little Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.</p>
<p>
	He came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his Cousin Peter.</p>
<p>
	Peter was sitting by himself. He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; said little Benjamin, in a whisper, &ldquo;who has got your clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Peter replied, &ldquo;The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor&rsquo;s garden,&rdquo; and described how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.</p>
<p>
	Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that Mr. McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also; and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.</p>
<p>
	Peter said he hoped that it would rain.</p>
<p>
	At this point old Mrs. Rabbit&rsquo;s voice was heard inside the rabbit hole, calling: &ldquo;Cotton-tail! Cotton-tail! Fetch some more camomile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.</p>
<p>
	They went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood. From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor&rsquo;s garden. Peter&rsquo;s coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o&rsquo;-shanter of Mr. McGregor&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>
	Little Benjamin said: &ldquo;It spoils people&rsquo;s clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft.</p>
<p>
	It had been sown with lettuces.</p>
<p>
	They left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs.</p>
<p>
	Little Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back Peter&rsquo;s clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket-handkerchief.</p>
<p>
	They took them off the scarecrow. There had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.</p>
<p>
	Benjamin tried on the tam-o&rsquo;-shanter, but it was too big for him.</p>
<p>
	Then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions, as a little present for his Aunt.</p>
<p>
	Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.</p>
<p>
	Benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf. He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.</p>
<p>
	(The name of little Benjamin&rsquo;s papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.)</p>
<p>
	The lettuces certainly were very fine.</p>
<p>
	Peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. Presently he dropped half the onions.</p>
<p>
	Little Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree with a load of vegetables. He led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden. They went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red brick wall.</p>
<p>
	The mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny.</p>
<p>
	Presently Peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.</p>
<p>
	They got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs. Peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!</p>
<p>
	He was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>
	This is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!</p>
<p>
	Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large basket. . . .</p>
<p>
	The cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.</p>
<p>
	Perhaps she liked the smell of onions!</p>
<p>
	Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.</p>
<p>
	She sat there for FIVE HOURS.</p>
<p>
	I cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry.</p>
<p>
	The sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket.</p>
<p>
	At length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above.</p>
<p>
	The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.</p>
<p>
	He was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand.</p>
<p>
	He was looking for his son.</p>
<p>
	Old Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats. He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse, scratching off a handful of fur.</p>
<p>
	The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.</p>
<p>
	When old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the door.</p>
<p>
	Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch.</p>
<p>
	Then he took out his nephew Peter.</p>
<p>
	Then he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the garden.</p>
<p>
	When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him.</p>
<p>
	It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs&mdash;only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!</p>
<p>
	Also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up INSIDE the greenhouse, locking the door upon the OUTSIDE.</p>
<p>
	When Peter got home his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat. Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the rabbit-tobacco.</p>
