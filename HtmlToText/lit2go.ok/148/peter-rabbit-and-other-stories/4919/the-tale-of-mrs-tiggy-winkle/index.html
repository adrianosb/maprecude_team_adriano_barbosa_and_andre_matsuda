                <p>
	Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town. She was a good little girl&mdash;only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!</p>
<p>
	One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying&mdash;oh, she did cry so! &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my pocket-handkin! Three handkins and a pinny! Have YOU seen them, Tabby Kitten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen&mdash;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Sally Henny-penny, have YOU found three pocket-handkins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking&mdash;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	And then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig. Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.</p>
<p>
	Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little-town&mdash;a hill that goes up&mdash;up&mdash;into the clouds as though it had no top!</p>
<p>
	And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.</p>
<p>
	Lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her short legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way&mdash;up and up&mdash;until Little-town was right away down below&mdash;she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!</p>
<p>
	Presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hillside.</p>
<p>
	Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water&mdash;but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! And where the sand upon the path was wet&mdash;there were footmarks of a VERY small person.</p>
<p>
	Lucie ran on, and on.</p>
<p>
	The path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins&mdash;but no pocket-handkerchiefs!</p>
<p>
	But there was something else&mdash;a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		&ldquo;Lily-white and clean, oh!<br />
		With little frills between, oh!<br />
		Smooth and hot-red rusty spot<br />
		Never here be seen, oh!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Lucie knocked-once-twice, and interrupted the song. A little frightened voice called out &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?&mdash;a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams&mdash; just like any other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie&rsquo;s head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.</p>
<p>
	There was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand, stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.</p>
<p>
	Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap-where Lucie had yellow curls-that little person had PRICKLES!</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said Lucie. &ldquo;Have you seen my pocket-handkins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The little person made a bob-curtsey&mdash;&ldquo;Oh yes, if you please&rsquo;m; my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh yes if you please&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m an excellent clear-starcher!&rdquo; And she took something out of the clothesbasket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that thing?&rdquo; said Lucie,&ldquo;that&rsquo;s not my pocket-handkin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh no, if you please&rsquo;m; that&rsquo;s a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to Cock Robin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.</p>
<p>
	Then she took something else off a clothes-horse&mdash;&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t my pinny?&rdquo; said Lucie.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh no, if you please&rsquo;m; that&rsquo;s a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny Wren; look how it&rsquo;s stained with currant wine! It&rsquo;s very bad to wash!&rdquo; said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.</p>
<p>
	Mrs. Tiggy-winkle&rsquo;s nose went sniffle sniffle snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one of my pocket-handkins!&rdquo; cried Lucie&mdash;&ldquo;and there&rsquo;s my pinny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh that IS lovely!&rdquo; said Lucie.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny&mdash;look how she&rsquo;s worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! She&rsquo;ll very soon go barefoot!&rdquo; said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s another hankersniff&mdash; but it isn&rsquo;t mine; it&rsquo;s red?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh no, if you please&rsquo;m; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it DID so smell of onions! I&rsquo;ve had to wash it separately, I can&rsquo;t get out that smell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another one of mine,&rdquo; said Lucie.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What are those funny little white things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron them; she washes them herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my last pocket-handkin!&rdquo; said Lucie.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And what are you dipping into the basin of starch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;They&rsquo;re little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse&mdash;most terrible particular!&rdquo; said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve finished my ironing; I&rsquo;m going to air some clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What are these dear soft fluffy things?&rdquo; said Lucie.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Will their jackets take off?&rdquo; asked Lucie.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh yes, if you please&rsquo;m; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. And here&rsquo;s one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town. They&rsquo;re ALWAYS marked at washing!&rdquo; said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.</p>
<p>
	And she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes&mdash;small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tail-coat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing&mdash;and at last the basket was empty!</p>
<p>
	Then Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea&mdash;a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie. They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle&rsquo;s hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were HAIRPINS sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn&rsquo;t like to sit too near her.</p>
<p>
	When they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and Lucie&rsquo;s pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin.</p>
<p>
	And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill.</p>
<p>
	Then away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!</p>
<p>
	All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny!</p>
<p>
	And she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.</p>
<p>
	So that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except Lucie&rsquo;s one little bundle.</p>
<p>
	Lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; and to thank the washer-woman.&mdash;But what a VERY odd thing! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!</p>
<p>
	She was running running running up the hill&mdash;and where was her white frilled cap? And her shawl? And her gown and her petticoat?</p>
<p>
	And HOW small she had grown&mdash; and HOW brown&mdash;and covered with PRICKLES!</p>
<p>
	Why! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG!</p>
<p>
	* * * * * *</p>
<p>
	(Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile&mdash;but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?</p>
<p>
	And besides&mdash;I have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat Bells&mdash;and besides I am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!)</p>
