                <p>
	This is a Tale about a tail&mdash;a tail that belonged to a little red squirrel, and his name was Nutkin.</p>
<p>
	He had a brother called Twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake.</p>
<p>
	In the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the house of an owl who is called Old Brown.</p>
<p>
	One autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and green&mdash;Nutkin and Twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.</p>
<p>
	They made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to Owl Island to gather nuts.</p>
<p>
	Each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail for a sail.</p>
<p>
	They also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for Old Brown, and put them down upon his door-step.</p>
<p>
	Then Twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely&mdash;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Old Mr. Brown, will you favor us with permission to gather nuts upon your island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	But Nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners. He bobbed up and down like a little red CHERRY, singing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		&ldquo;Riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!<br />
		A little wee man, in a red red coat!<br />
		A staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat;<br />
		If you&rsquo;ll tell me this riddle, I&rsquo;ll give you a groat.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Now this riddle is as old as the hills; Mr. Brown paid no attention whatever to Nutkin.</p>
<p>
	He shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.</p>
<p>
	The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening.</p>
<p>
	But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of Old Brown&rsquo;s doorway, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Mr. Brown, will you favor us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old Mr. Brown with a NETTLE and singing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		&ldquo;Old Mr. B! Riddle-me-ree!<br />
		Hitty Pitty within the wall,<br />
		Hitty Pitty without the wall;<br />
		If you touch Hitty Pitty,<br />
		Hitty Pitty will bite you!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Mr. Brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.</p>
<p>
	He shut the door in Nutkin&rsquo;s face. Presently a little thread of blue SMOKE from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and Nutkin peeped through the key-hole and sang&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		&ldquo;A house full, a hole full!<br />
		And you cannot gather a bowl-full!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	The squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks.</p>
<p>
	But Nutkin gathered oak-apples&mdash;yellow and scarlet&mdash;and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old Mr. Brown.</p>
<p>
	On the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they caught seven fat minnows as a present for Old Brown.</p>
<p>
	They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl Island.</p>
<p>
	Twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but Nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all. He ran in front, singing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		&ldquo;The man in the wilderness said to me,<br />
		&lsquo;How may strawberries grow in the sea?&rsquo;<br />
		I answered him as I thought good&mdash;<br />
		&lsquo;As many red herrings as grow in the wood.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	But old Mr. Brown took no interest in riddles&mdash;not even when the answer was provided for him.</p>
<p>
	On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in PLUM PUDDING for Old Brown. Each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dock leaf, fastened with a pine-needle-pin.</p>
<p>
	But Nutkin sang as rudely as ever&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		&ldquo;Old Mr. B! riddle-me-ree!<br />
		Flour of England, fruit of Spain,<br />
		Met together in a shower of rain;<br />
		Put in a bag tied round with a string,<br />
		If you&rsquo;ll tell me this riddle,<br />
		I&rsquo;ll give you a ring!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Which was ridiculous of Nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to Old Brown.</p>
<p>
	The other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but Nutkin gathered robin&rsquo;s pin-cushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle-pins.</p>
<p>
	On the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone. They had stolen it out of a bumble BEES&rsquo; nest on the tippity top of the hill.</p>
<p>
	But Nutkin skipped up and down, singing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		&ldquo;Hum-a-bum! Buzz! Buzz! Hum-a-bum buzz!<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I went over Tipple-tine<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I met a flock of bonny swine;<br />
		Some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were the very bonniest swine<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That e&rsquo;er went over the Tipple-tine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Old Mr. Brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of Nutkin.</p>
<p>
	But he ate up the honey!</p>
<p>
	The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.</p>
<p>
	But Nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones.</p>
<p>
	On the sixth day, which was Saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time; they brought a new-laid EGG in a little rush basket as a last parting present for Old Brown.</p>
<p>
	But Nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		&ldquo;Humpty Dumpty lies in the beck,<br />
		With a white counterpane round his neck,<br />
		Forty doctors and forty wrights,<br />
		Cannot put Humpty Dumpty to rights!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Now old Mr. Brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again. But still he did not speak.</p>
<p>
	Nutkin became more and more impertinent&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		&ldquo;Old Mr. B! Old Mr. B!<br />
		Hickamore, Hackamore, on the King&rsquo;s kitchen door;<br />
		All the King&rsquo;s horses, and all the King&rsquo;s men,<br />
		Couldn&rsquo;t drive Hickamore, Hackamore,<br />
		Off the King&rsquo;s kitchen door!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Nutkin danced up and down like a SUNBEAM; but still Old Brown said nothing at all.</p>
<p>
	Nutkin began again&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		&ldquo;Authur O&rsquo;Bower has broken his band,<br />
		He comes roaring up the land!<br />
		The King of Scots with all his power,<br />
		Cannot turn Arthur of the Bower!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the WIND, and he took a running jump right onto the head of Old Brown! . . .</p>
<p>
	Then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud &ldquo;Squeak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.</p>
<p>
	When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree&mdash;there was Old Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>
	* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>
	BUT NUTKIN WAS IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET!</p>
<p>
	This looks like the end of the story; but it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>
	Old Brown carried Nutkin into his house, and held him up by the tail, intending to skin him; but Nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke in two, and he dashed up the staircase, and escaped out of the attic window.</p>
<p>
	And to this day, if you meet Nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout&mdash;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k!&rdquo;</p>
