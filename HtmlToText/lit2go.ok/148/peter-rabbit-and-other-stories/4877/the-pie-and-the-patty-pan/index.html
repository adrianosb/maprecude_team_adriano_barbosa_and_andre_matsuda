                <p>
	Pussycat sits by the fire&mdash;how should she be fair?<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In walks the little dog&mdash;says &ldquo;Cat are you there?<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you do Mistress Kitty? Mistress Cat, how<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do you do?&rdquo;<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I thank you kindly, little dog, I fare as well as you!&rdquo;<br />
	Once upon a time there was a Pussycat called Ribby, who invited a little dog called Duchess to tea.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Come in good time, my dear Duchess,&rdquo; said Ribby&rsquo;s letter, &ldquo;and we will have something so very nice. I am baking it in a pie-dish&mdash;a pie-dish with a pink rim. You never tasted anything so good! And YOU shall eat it all! I will eat muffins, my dear Duchess!&rdquo; wrote Ribby.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I will come very punctually, my dear Ribby,&rdquo; wrote Duchess; and then at the end she added&mdash;&ldquo;I hope it isn&rsquo;t mouse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	And then she thought that did not look quite polite; so she scratched out &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t mouse&rdquo; and changed it to &ldquo;I hope it will be fine,&rdquo; and she gave her letter to the postman.</p>
<p>
	But she thought a great deal about Ribby&rsquo;s pie, and she read Ribby&rsquo;s letter over and over again.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I am dreadfully afraid it WILL be mouse!&rdquo; said Duchess to herself&mdash;&ldquo;I really couldn&rsquo;t, COULDN&rsquo;T eat mouse pie. And I shall have to eat it, because it is a party. And MY pie was going to be veal and ham. A pink and white pie-dish! And so is mine; just like Ribby&rsquo;s dishes; they were both bought at Tabitha Twitchit&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh what a good idea! Why shouldn&rsquo;t I rush along and put my pie into Ribby&rsquo;s oven when Ribby isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Ribby in the meantime had received Duchess&rsquo;s answer, and as soon as she was sure that the little dog would come&mdash;she popped HER pie into the oven. There were two ovens, one above the other; some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open. Ribby put the pie into the lower oven; the door was very stiff.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The top oven bakes too quickly,&rdquo; said Ribby to herself.</p>
<p>
	Ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth. Then she went out with a can to the well, for water to fill up the kettle.</p>
<p>
	Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as well as the kitchen.</p>
<p>
	When Ribby had laid the table she went out down the field to the farm, to fetch milk and butter.</p>
<p>
	When she came back, she peeped into the bottom oven; the pie looked very comfortable.</p>
<p>
	Ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket, to the village shop to buy a packet of tea, a pound of lump sugar, and a pot of marmalade.</p>
<p>
	And just at the same time, Duchess came out of HER house, at the other end of the village.</p>
<p>
	Ribby met Duchess half-way down the street, also carrying a basket, covered with a cloth. They only bowed to one another; they did not speak, because they were going to have a party.</p>
<p>
	As soon as Duchess had got round the corner out of sight&mdash;she simply ran! Straight away to Ribby&rsquo;s house!</p>
<p>
	Ribby went into the shop and bought what she required, and came out, after a pleasant gossip with Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.</p>
<p>
	Ribby went on to Timothy Baker&rsquo;s and bought the muffins. Then she went home.</p>
<p>
	There seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage, as she was coming in at the front door. But there was nobody there.</p>
<p>
	Duchess in the meantime, had slipped out at the back door.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It is a very odd thing that Ribby&rsquo;s pie was NOT in the oven when I put mine in! And I can&rsquo;t find it anywhere; I have looked all over the house. I put MY pie into a nice hot oven at the top. I could not turn any of the other handles; I think that they are all shams,&rdquo; said Duchess, &ldquo;but I wish I could have removed the pie made of mouse! I cannot think what she has done with it? I heard Ribby coming and I had to run out by the back door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Duchess went home and brushed her beautiful black coat; and then she picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for Ribby; and passed the time until the clock struck four.</p>
<p>
	Ribby&mdash;having assured herself by careful search that there was really no one hiding in the cupboard or in the larder&mdash;went upstairs to change her dress.</p>
<p>
	She came downstairs again, and made the tea, and put the teapot on the hob. She peeped again into the BOTTOM oven, the pie had become a lovely brown, and it was steaming hot.</p>
<p>
	She sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog. &ldquo;I am glad I used the BOTTOM oven,&rdquo; said Ribby, &ldquo;the top one would certainly have been very much too hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Very punctually at four o&rsquo;clock, Duchess started to go to the party.</p>
<p>
	At a quarter past four to the minute, there came a most genteel little tap-tappity. &ldquo;Is Mrs. Ribston at home?&rdquo; inquired Duchess in the porch.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Come in! And how do you do, my dear Duchess?&rdquo; cried Ribby. &ldquo;I hope I see you well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Quite well, I thank you, and how do YOU do, my dear Ribby?&rdquo; said Duchess. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you some flowers; what a delicious smell of pie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, what lovely flowers! Yes, it is mouse and bacon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I think it wants another five minutes,&rdquo; said Ribby. &ldquo;Just a shade longer; I will pour out the tea, while we wait. Do you take sugar, my dear Duchess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh yes, please! My dear Ribby; and may I have a lump upon my nose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;With pleasure, my dear Duchess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Duchess sat up with the sugar on her nose and sniffed&mdash;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;How good that pie smells! I do love veal and ham&mdash;I mean to say mouse and bacon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She dropped the sugar in confusion, and had to go hunting under the tea-table, so did not see which oven Ribby opened in order to get out the pie.</p>
<p>
	Ribby set the pie upon the table; there was a very savory smell.</p>
<p>
	Duchess came out from under the tablecloth munching sugar, and sat up on a chair.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I will first cut the pie for you; I am going to have muffin and marmalade,&rdquo; said Ribby.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I think&rdquo;&mdash;(thought Duchess to herself)&mdash;&ldquo;I THINK it would be wiser if I helped myself to pie; though Ribby did not seem to notice anything when she was cutting it. What very small fine pieces it has cooked into! I did not remember that I had minced it up so fine; I suppose this is a quicker oven than my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The pie-dish was emptying rapidly! Duchess had had four helps already, and was fumbling with the spoon.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A little more bacon, my dear Duchess?&rdquo; said Ribby.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Thank you, my dear Ribby; I was only feeling for the patty-pan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The patty-pan? my dear Duchess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The patty-pan that held up the pie-crust,&rdquo; said Duchess, blushing under her black coat.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t put one in, my dear Duchess,&rdquo; said Ribby; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that it is necessary in pies made of mouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Duchess fumbled with the spoon&mdash; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find it!&rdquo; she said anxiously.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a patty-pan,&rdquo; said Ribby, looking perplexed.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes, indeed, my dear Ribby; where can it have gone to?&rdquo; said Duchess.</p>
<p>
	Duchess looked very much alarmed, and continued to scoop the inside of the pie-dish.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I have only four patty-pans, and they are all in the cupboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Duchess set up a howl.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I shall die! I shall die! I have swallowed a patty-pan! Oh, my dear Ribby, I do feel so ill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It is impossible, my dear Duchess; there was not a patty-pan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes there WAS, my dear Ribby, I am sure I have swallowed it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Let me prop you up with a pillow, my dear Duchess; where do you think you feel it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh I do feel so ill ALL OVER me, my dear Ribby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Shall I run for the doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh yes, yes! Fetch Dr. Maggotty, my dear Ribby: he is a Pie himself, he will certainly understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Ribby settled Duchess in an armchair before the fire, and went out and hurried to the village to look for the doctor.</p>
<p>
	She found him at the smithy.</p>
<p>
	Ribby explained that her guest had swallowed a patty-pan.</p>
<p>
	Dr. Maggotty hopped so fast that Ribby had to run. It was most conspicuous. All the village could see that Ribby was fetching the doctor.</p>
<p>
	But while Ribby had been hunting for the doctor&mdash;a curious thing had happened to Duchess, who had been left by herself, sitting before the fire, sighing and groaning and feeling very unhappy.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;How COULD I have swallowed it! Such a large thing as a patty-pan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She sat down again, and stared mournfully at the grate. The fire crackled and danced, and something sizz-z-zled!</p>
<p>
	Duchess started! She opened the door of the TOP oven;&mdash;out came a rich steamy flavor of veal and ham, and there stood a fine brown pie,&mdash; and through a hole in the top of the pie-crust there was a glimpse of a little tin patty-pan!</p>
<p>
	Duchess drew a long breath&mdash;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Then I must have been eating MOUSE! . . . No wonder I feel ill. . . . But perhaps I should feel worse if I had really swallowed a patty-pan!&rdquo; Duchess reflected&mdash;&ldquo;What a very awkward thing to have to explain to Ribby! I think I will put MY pie in the back-yard and say nothing about it. When I go home, I will run round and take it away.&rdquo; She put it outside the back-door, and sat down again by the fire, and shut her eyes; when Ribby arrived with the doctor, she seemed fast asleep.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I am feeling very much better,&rdquo; said Duchess, waking up with a jump.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I am truly glad to hear it! He has brought you a pill, my dear Duchess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I think I should feel QUITE well if he only felt my pulse,&rdquo; said Duchess, backing away from the magpie, who sidled up with something in his beak.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It is only a bread pill, you had much better take it; drink a little milk, my dear Duchess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I am feeling very much better, my dear Ribby,&rdquo; said Duchess. &ldquo;Do you not think that I had better go home before it gets dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Perhaps it might be wise, my dear Duchess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Ribby and Duchess said good-bye affectionately, and Duchess started home. Halfway up the lane she stopped and looked back; Ribby had gone in and shut her door. Duchess slipped through the fence, and ran round to the back of Ribby&rsquo;s house, and peeped into the yard.</p>
<p>
	Upon the roof of the pig-sty sat Dr. Maggotty and three jackdaws. The jackdaws were eating piecrust, and the magpie was drinking gravy out of a patty-pan.</p>
<p>
	Duchess ran home feeling uncommonly silly!</p>
<p>
	When Ribby came out for a pailful of water to wash up the tea-things, she found a pink and white pie-dish lying smashed in the middle of the yard.</p>
<p>
