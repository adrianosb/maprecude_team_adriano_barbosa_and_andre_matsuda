                <p>
	Once upon a time there was a woodmouse, and her name was Mrs. Tittlemouse.</p>
<p>
	She lived in a bank under a hedge.</p>
<p>
	Such a funny house! There were yards and yards of sandy passages, leading to store-rooms and nut cellars and seed cellars, all amongst the roots of the hedge.</p>
<p>
	There was a kitchen, a parlor, a pantry, and a larder.</p>
<p>
	Also, there was Mrs. Tittle-mouse&rsquo;s bedroom, where she slept in a little box bed!</p>
<p>
	Mrs. Tittlemouse was a most terribly tidy particular little mouse, always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors.</p>
<p>
	Sometimes a beetle lost its way in the passages.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Shuh! Shuh! Little dirty feet!&rdquo; said Mrs. Tittlemouse, clattering her dustpan.</p>
<p>
	And one day a little old woman ran up and down in a red spotty cloak.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Your house is on fire, Mother Ladybird! Fly away home to your children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Another day, a big fat spider came in to shelter from the rain.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Beg pardon, is this not Miss Muffet&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Go away, you bold bad spider! Leaving ends of cobweb all over my nice clean house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She bundled the spider out at a window.</p>
<p>
	He let himself down the hedge with a long thin bit of string.</p>
<p>
	Mrs. Tittlemouse went on her way to a distant storeroom, to fetch cherrystones and thistle-down seed for dinner.</p>
<p>
	All along the passage she sniffed, and looked at the floor.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I smell a smell of honey; is it the cowslips outside, in the hedge? I am sure I can see the marks of little dirty feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Suddenly round a corner, she met Babbitty Bumble&mdash;&ldquo;Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!&rdquo; said the bumble bee.</p>
<p>
	Mrs. Tittlemouse looked at her severely. She wished that she had a broom.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Good-day, Babbitty Bumble; I should be glad to buy some bees-wax. But what are you doing down here? Why do you always come in at a window, and say, Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz?&rdquo; Mrs. Tittle-mouse began to get cross.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Zizz, Wizz, Wizzz!&rdquo; replied Babbitty Bumble in a peevish squeak. She sidled down a passage, and disappeared into a storeroom which had been used for acorns.</p>
<p>
	Mrs. Tittlemouse had eaten the acorns before Christmas; the storeroom ought to have been empty.</p>
<p>
	But it was full of untidy dry moss.</p>
<p>
	Mrs. Tittlemouse began to pull out the moss. Three or four other bees put their heads out, and buzzed fiercely.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I am not in the habit of letting lodgings; this is an intrusion!&rdquo; said Mrs. Tittlemouse. &ldquo;I will have them turned out &mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Buzz! Buzz! Buzzz!&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>
	&rdquo;I wonder who would help me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Bizz, Wizz, Wizzz!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&mdash;&ldquo;I will not have Mr. Jackson; he never wipes his feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Mrs. Tittlemouse decided to leave the bees till after dinner.</p>
<p>
	When she got back to the parlor, she heard some one coughing in a fat voice; and there sat Mr. Jackson himself.</p>
<p>
	He was sitting all over a small rocking chair, twiddling his thumbs and smiling, with his feet on the fender.</p>
<p>
	He lived in a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Jackson? Deary me, you have got very wet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! I&rsquo;ll sit awhile and dry myself,&rdquo; said Mr. Jackson.</p>
<p>
	He sat and smiled, and the water dripped off his coat tails. Mrs. Tittlemouse went round with a mop.</p>
<p>
	He sat such a while that he had to be asked if he would take some dinner?</p>
<p>
	First she offered him cherry-stones. &ldquo;Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! No teeth, no teeth, no teeth!&rdquo; said Mr. Jackson.</p>
<p>
	He opened his mouth most unnecessarily wide; he certainly had not a tooth in his head.</p>
<p>
	Then she offered him thistle-down seed&mdash;&ldquo;Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Pouff, pouff, puff.&rdquo; said Mr. Jackson. He blew the thistle-down all over the room.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! Now what I really&mdash;REALLY should like&mdash; would be a little dish of honey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I am afraid I have not got any, Mr. Jackson!&rdquo; said Mrs. Tittlemouse.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!&rdquo; said the smiling Mr. Jackson, &ldquo;I can SMELL it; that is why I came to call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Mr. Jackson rose ponderously from the table, and began to look into the cupboards.</p>
<p>
	Mrs. Tittlemouse followed him with a dishcloth, to wipe his large wet footmarks off the parlor floor.</p>
<p>
	When he had convinced himself that there was no honey in the cupboards, he began to walk down the passage.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Indeed, indeed, you will stick fast, Mr. Jackson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	First he squeezed into the pantry.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Tiddly, widdly, widdly? No honey? No honey, Mrs. Tittlemouse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	There were three creepy-crawly people hiding in the plate rack. Two of them got away; but the littlest one he caught.</p>
<p>
	Then he squeezed into the larder. Miss Butterfly was tasting the sugar; but she flew away out of the window.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse; you seem to have plenty of visitors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And without any invitation!&rdquo; said Mrs. Thomasina Tittlemouse.</p>
<p>
	They went along the sandy passage&mdash;&ldquo;Tiddly, widdly&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Buzz! Wizz! Wizz!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He met Babbitty round a corner, and snapped her up, and put her down again.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I do not like bumble bees. They are all over bristles,&rdquo; said Mr. Jackson, wiping his mouth with his coat sleeve.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Get out, you nasty old toad!&rdquo; shrieked Babbitty Bumble.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I shall go distracted!&rdquo; scolded Mrs. Tittlemouse.</p>
<p>
	She shut herself up in the nut cellar while Mr. Jackson pulled out the bees-nest. He seemed to have no objection to stings.</p>
<p>
	When Mrs. Tittlemouse ventured to come out&mdash;everybody had gone away.</p>
<p>
	But the untidiness was something dreadful&mdash;&ldquo;Never did I see such a mess&mdash;smears of honey; and moss, and thistledown&mdash;and marks of big and little dirty feet&mdash; all over my nice clean house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She gathered up the moss and the remains of the bees-wax.</p>
<p>
	Then she went out and fetched some twigs, to partly close up the front door.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I will make it too small for Mr. Jackson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She fetched soft soap, and flannel, and a new scrubbing brush from the storeroom. But she was too tired to do any more. First she fell asleep in her chair, and then she went to bed.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Will it ever be tidy again?&rdquo; said poor Mrs. Tittlemouse.</p>
<p>
	Next morning she got up very early and began a spring cleaning which lasted a fort-night.</p>
<p>
	She swept, and scrubbed, and dusted; and she rubbed up the furniture with bees-wax, and polished her little tin spoons.</p>
<p>
	When it was all beautifully neat and clean, she gave a party to five other little mice, without Mr. Jackson.</p>
<p>
	He smelt the party and came up the bank, but he could not squeeze in at the door.</p>
<p>
	So they handed him out acorn cupfuls of honeydew through the window, and he was not at all offended.</p>
<p>
	He sat outside in the sun, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Your very good health, Mrs. Tittlemouse!&rdquo;</p>
