                <p>
	At first there was a dead silence in the Court. Then everybody began whispering or giggling at the same time, till the whole room sounded like a great hive of bees. Many people seemed to be shocked; most of them were amused; and a few were angry.</p>
<p>
	Presently up sprang the nasty lawyer with the long nose.</p>
<p>
	&quot;I protest, Your Honor,&quot; he cried, waving his arms wildly to the judge. &quot;I object. The dignity of this court is in peril. I protest.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I am the one to take care of the dignity of this court,&quot; said the judge.</p>
<p>
	Then Mr. Jenkyns got up again. (If it hadn&#39;t been such a serious matter, it was almost like a Punch-and-Judy show: somebody was always popping down and somebody else popping up).</p>
<p>
	&quot;If there is any doubt on the score of our being able to do as we say, Your Honor will have no objection, I trust, to the Doctor&#39;s giving the Court a demonstration of his powers&mdash;of showing that he actually can understand the speech of animals?&quot; I thought I saw a twinkle of amusement come into the old judge&#39;s eyes as he sat considering a moment before he answered.</p>
<p>
	&quot;No,&quot; he said at last, &quot;I don&#39;t think so.&quot; Then he turned to the Doctor.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Are you quite sure you can do this?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Quite, Your Honor,&quot; said the Doctor&mdash;&quot;quite sure.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Very well then,&quot; said the judge. &quot;If you can satisfy us that you really are able to understand canine testimony, the dog shall be admitted as a witness. I do not see, in that case, how I could object to his being heard. But I warn you that if you are trying to make a laughing-stock of this Court it will go hard with you.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I protest, I protest!&quot; yelled the long-nosed Prosecutor. &quot;This is a scandal, an outrage to the Bar!&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Sit down!&quot; said the judge in a very stern voice.</p>
<p>
	&quot;What animal does Your Honor wish me to talk with?&quot; asked the Doctor.</p>
<p>
	&quot;I would like you to talk to my own dog,&quot; said the judge. &quot;He is outside in the cloak-room. I will have him brought in; and then we shall see what you can do.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Then someone went out and fetched the judge&#39;s dog, a lovely great Russian wolf-hound with slender legs and a shaggy coat. He was a proud and beautiful creature.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Now, Doctor,&quot; said the judge, &quot;did you ever see this dog before?&mdash;Remember you are in the witness-stand and under oath.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;No, Your Honor, I never saw him before.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Very well then, will you please ask him to tell you what I had for supper last night? He was with me and watched me while I ate.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Then the Doctor and the dog started talking to one another in signs and sounds; and they kept at it for quite a long time. And the Doctor began to giggle and get so interested that he seemed to forget all about the Court and the judge and everything else.</p>
<p>
	&quot;What a time he takes!&quot; I heard a fat woman in front of me whispering. &quot;He&#39;s only pretending. Of course he can&#39;t do it! Who ever heard of talking to a dog? He must think we&#39;re children.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Haven&#39;t you finished yet?&quot; the judge asked the Doctor. &quot;It shouldn&#39;t take that long just to ask what I had for supper.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Oh no, Your Honor,&quot; said the Doctor. &quot;The dog told me that long ago. But then he went on to tell me what you did after supper.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Never mind that,&quot; said the judge. &quot;Tell me what answer he gave you to my question.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;He says you had a mutton-chop, two baked potatoes, a pickled walnut and a glass of ale.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The Honorable Eustace Beauchamp Conckley went white to the lips.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Sounds like witchcraft,&quot; he muttered. &quot;I never dreamed&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;And after your supper,&quot; the Doctor went on, &quot;he says you went to see a prize-fight and then sat up playing cards for money till twelve o&#39;clock and came home singing, &#39;We wont get&mdash;&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;That will do,&quot; the judge interrupted, &quot;I am satisfied you can do as you say. The prisoner&#39;s dog shall be admitted as a witness.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I protest, I object!&quot; screamed the Prosecutor. &quot;Your Honor, this is&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Sit down!&quot; roared the judge. &quot;I say the dog shall be heard. That ends the matter. Put the witness in the stand.&quot;</p>
<p>
	And then for the first time in the solemn history of England a dog was put in the witness-stand of Her Majesty&#39;s Court of Assizes. And it was I, Tommy Stubbins (when the Doctor made a sign to me across the room) who proudly led Bob up the aisle, through the astonished crowd, past the frowning, spluttering, long-nosed Prosecutor, and made him comfortable on a high chair in the witness-box; from where the old bulldog sat scowling down over the rail upon the amazed and gaping jury.</p>
