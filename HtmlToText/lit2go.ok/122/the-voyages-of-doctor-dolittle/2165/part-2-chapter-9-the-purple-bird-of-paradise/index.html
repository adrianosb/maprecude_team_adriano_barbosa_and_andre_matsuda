                <p>
	Polynesia was waiting for us in the front porch. She looked full of some important news.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Doctor,&quot; said she, &quot;the Purple Bird-of-Paradise has arrived!&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;At last!&quot; said the Doctor. &quot;I had begun to fear some accident had befallen her. And how is Miranda?&quot;</p>
<p>
	From the excited way in which the Doctor fumbled his key into the lock I guessed that we were not going to get our tea right away, even now.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Oh, she seemed all right when she arrived,&quot; said Polynesia&mdash;&quot;tired from her long journey of course but otherwise all right. But what DO you think? That mischief-making sparrow, Cheapside, insulted her as soon as she came into the garden. When I arrived on the scene she was in tears and was all for turning round and going straight back to Brazil to-night. I had the hardest work persuading her to wait till you came. She&#39;s in the study. I shut Cheapside in one of your book-cases and told him I&#39;d tell you exactly what had happened the moment you got home.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The Doctor frowned, then walked silently and quickly to the study.</p>
<p>
	Here we found the candles lit; for the daylight was nearly gone. Dab-Dab was standing on the floor mounting guard over one of the glass-fronted book-cases in which Cheapside had been imprisoned. The noisy little sparrow was still fluttering angrily behind the glass when we came in.</p>
<p>
	In the centre of the big table, perched on the ink-stand, stood the most beautiful bird I have ever seen. She had a deep violet-colored breast, scarlet wings and a long, long sweeping tail of gold. She was unimaginably beautiful but looked dreadfully tired. Already she had her head under her wing; and she swayed gently from side to side on top of the ink-stand like a bird that has flown long and far.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Sh!&quot; said Dab-Dab. &quot;Miranda is asleep. I&#39;ve got this little imp Cheapside in here. Listen, Doctor: for Heaven&#39;s sake send that sparrow away before he does any more mischief. He&#39;s nothing but a vulgar little nuisance. We&#39;ve had a perfectly awful time trying to get Miranda to stay. Shall I serve your tea in here, or will you come into the kitchen when you&#39;re ready?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;We&#39;ll come into the kitchen, Dab-Dab,&quot; said the Doctor. &quot;Let Cheapside out before you go, please.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Dab-Dab opened the bookcase-door and Cheapside strutted out trying hard not to look guilty.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Cheapside,&quot; said the Doctor sternly, &quot;what did you say to Miranda when she arrived?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I didn&#39;t say nothing, Doc, straight I didn&#39;t. That is, nothing much. I was picking up crumbs off the gravel path when she comes swanking into the garden, turning up her nose in all directions, as though she owned the earth&mdash;just because she&#39;s got a lot of colored plumage. A London sparrow&#39;s as good as her any day. I don&#39;t hold by these gawdy bedizened foreigners nohow. Why don&#39;t they stay in their own country?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;But what did you say to her that got her so offended?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;All I said was, &#39;You don&#39;t belong in an English garden; you ought to be in a milliner&#39;s window. That&#39;s all.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Cheapside. Don&#39;t you realize that this bird has come thousands of miles to see me&mdash;only to be insulted by your impertinent tongue as soon as she reaches my garden? What do you mean by it?&mdash;If she had gone away again before I got back to-night I would never have forgiven you&mdash;Leave the room.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Sheepishly, but still trying to look as though he didn&#39;t care, Cheapside hopped out into the passage and Dab-Dab closed the door.</p>
<p>
	The Doctor went up to the beautiful bird on the ink-stand and gently stroked its back. Instantly its head popped out from under its wing.</p>
