                <p>
	This, O Best Beloved, is another story of the High and Far-Off Times. In the very middle of those times was a Stickly-Prickly Hedgehog, and he lived on the banks of the turbid Amazon, eating shelly snails and things. And he had a friend, a Slow-Solid Tortoise, who lived on the banks of the turbid Amazon, eating green lettuces and things. And so that was all right, Best Beloved. Do you see?</p>
<p>
	But also, and at the same time, in those High and Far-Off Times, there was a Painted Jaguar, and he lived on the banks of the turbid Amazon too; and he ate everything that he could catch. When he could not catch deer or monkeys he would eat frogs and beetles; and when he could not catch frogs and beetles he went to his Mother Jaguar, and she told him how to eat hedgehogs and tortoises.</p>
<p>
	She said to him ever so many times, graciously waving her tail, &lsquo;My son, when you find a Hedgehog you must drop him into the water and then he will uncoil, and when you catch a Tortoise you must scoop him out of his shell with your paw.&rsquo; And so that was all right, Best Beloved.</p>
<p>
	One beautiful night on the banks of the turbid Amazon, Painted Jaguar found Stickly-Prickly Hedgehog and Slow-Solid Tortoise sitting under the trunk of a fallen tree. They could not run away, and so Stickly-Prickly curled himself up into a ball, because he was a Hedgehog, and Slow-Solid Tortoise drew in his head and feet into his shell as far as they would go, because he was a Tortoise; and so that was all right, Best Beloved. Do you see?</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Now attend to me,&rsquo; said Painted Jaguar, &lsquo;because this is very important. My mother said that when I meet a Hedgehog I am to drop him into the water and then he will uncoil, and when I meet a Tortoise I am to scoop him out of his shell with my paw. Now which of you is Hedgehog and which is Tortoise? because, to save my spots, I can&rsquo;t tell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Are you sure of what your Mummy told you?&rsquo; said Stickly-Prickly Hedgehog. &lsquo;Are you quite sure? Perhaps she said that when you uncoil a Tortoise you must shell him out the water with a scoop, and when you paw a Hedgehog you must drop him on the shell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Are you sure of what your Mummy told you?&rsquo; said Slow-and-Solid Tortoise. &lsquo;Are you quite sure? Perhaps she said that when you water a Hedgehog you must drop him into your paw, and when you meet a Tortoise you must shell him till he uncoils.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it was at all like that,&rsquo; said Painted Jaguar, but he felt a little puzzled; &lsquo;but, please, say it again more distinctly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;When you scoop water with your paw you uncoil it with a Hedgehog,&rsquo; said Stickly-Prickly. &lsquo;Remember that, because it&rsquo;s important.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said the Tortoise, &lsquo;when you paw your meat you drop it into a Tortoise with a scoop. Why can&rsquo;t you understand?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;You are making my spots ache,&rsquo; said Painted Jaguar; &lsquo;and besides, I didn&rsquo;t want your advice at all. I only wanted to know which of you is Hedgehog and which is Tortoise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t tell you,&rsquo; said Stickly-Prickly. &lsquo;but you can scoop me out of my shell if you like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; said Painted Jaguar. &lsquo;Now I know you&rsquo;re Tortoise. You thought I wouldn&rsquo;t! Now I will.&rsquo; Painted Jaguar darted out his paddy-paw just as Stickly-Prickly curled himself up, and of course Jaguar&rsquo;s paddy-paw was just filled with prickles. Worse than that, he knocked Stickly-Prickly away and away into the woods and the bushes, where it was too dark to find him. Then he put his paddy-paw into his mouth, and of course the prickles hurt him worse than ever. As soon as he could speak he said, &lsquo;Now I know he isn&rsquo;t Tortoise at all. But&rsquo;&mdash;and then he scratched his head with his un-prickly paw&mdash;&lsquo;how do I know that this other is Tortoise?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;But I am Tortoise,&rsquo; said Slow-and-Solid. Your mother was quite right. She said that you were to scoop me out of my shell with your paw. Begin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t say she said that a minute ago,&rsquo; said Painted Jaguar, sucking the prickles out of his paddy-paw. &lsquo;You said she said something quite different.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Well, suppose you say that I said that she said something quite different, I don&rsquo;t see that it makes any difference; because if she said what you said I said she said, it&rsquo;s just the same as if I said what she said she said. On the other hand, if you think she said that you were to uncoil me with a scoop, instead of pawing me into drops with a shell, I can&rsquo;t help that, can I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;But you said you wanted to be scooped out of your shell with my paw,&rsquo; said Painted Jaguar.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;If you&rsquo;ll think again you&rsquo;ll find that I didn&rsquo;t say anything of the kind. I said that your mother said that you were to scoop me out of my shell,&rsquo; said Slow-and-Solid.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;What will happen if I do?&rsquo; said the Jaguar most sniffily and most cautious.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, because I&rsquo;ve never been scooped out of my shell before; but I tell you truly, if you want to see me swim away you&rsquo;ve only got to drop me into the water.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rsquo; said Painted Jaguar. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve mixed up all the things my mother told me to do with the things that you asked me whether I was sure that she didn&rsquo;t say, till I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;m on my head or my painted tail; and now you come and tell me something I can understand, and it makes me more mixy than before. My mother told me that I was to drop one of you two into the water, and as you seem so anxious to be dropped I think you don&rsquo;t want to be dropped. So jump into the turbid Amazon and be quick about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I warn you that your Mummy won&rsquo;t be pleased. Don&rsquo;t tell her I didn&rsquo;t tell you,&rsquo; said Slow-Solid.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;If you say another word about what my mother said&mdash;&rsquo; the Jaguar answered, but he had not finished the sentence before Slow-and-Solid quietly dived into the turbid Amazon, swam under water for a long way, and came out on the bank where Stickly-Prickly was waiting for him.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	&lsquo;That was a very narrow escape,&rsquo; said Stickly-Prickly. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t rib Painted Jaguar. What did you tell him that you were?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I told him truthfully that I was a truthful Tortoise, but he wouldn&rsquo;t believe it, and he made me jump into the river to see if I was, and I was, and he is surprised. Now he&rsquo;s gone to tell his Mummy. Listen to him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	They could hear Painted Jaguar roaring up and down among the trees and the bushes by the side of the turbid Amazon, till his Mummy came.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Son, son!&rsquo; said his mother ever so many times, graciously waving her tail, &lsquo;what have you been doing that you shouldn&rsquo;t have done?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I tried to scoop something that said it wanted to be scooped out of its shell with my paw, and my paw is full of per-ickles,&rsquo; said Painted Jaguar.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Son, son!&rsquo; said his mother ever so many times, graciously waving her tail, &lsquo;by the prickles in your paddy-paw I see that that must have been a Hedgehog. You should have dropped him into the water.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I did that to the other thing; and he said he was a Tortoise, and I didn&rsquo;t believe him, and it was quite true, and he has dived under the turbid Amazon, and he won&rsquo;t come up again, and I haven&rsquo;t anything at all to eat, and I think we had better find lodgings somewhere else. They are too clever on the turbid Amazon for poor me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Son, son!&rsquo; said his mother ever so many times, graciously waving her tail, &lsquo;now attend to me and remember what I say. A Hedgehog curls himself up into a ball and his prickles stick out every which way at once. By this you may know the Hedgehog.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like this old lady one little bit,&rsquo; said Stickly-Prickly, under the shadow of a large leaf. &lsquo;I wonder what else she knows?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;A Tortoise can&rsquo;t curl himself up,&rsquo; Mother Jaguar went on, ever so many times, graciously waving her tail. &lsquo;He only draws his head and legs into his shell. By this you may know the tortoise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like this old lady at all&mdash;at all,&rsquo; said Slow-and-Solid Tortoise. &lsquo;Even Painted Jaguar can&rsquo;t forget those directions. It&rsquo;s a great pity that you can&rsquo;t swim, Stickly-Prickly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me,&rsquo; said Stickly-Prickly. &lsquo;Just think how much better it would be if you could curl up. This is a mess! Listen to Painted Jaguar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Painted Jaguar was sitting on the banks of the turbid Amazon sucking prickles out of his Paws and saying to himself&mdash;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t curl, but can swim&mdash;<br />
	Slow-Solid, that&rsquo;s him!<br />
	Curls up, but can&rsquo;t swim&mdash;<br />
	Stickly-Prickly, that&rsquo;s him!&rsquo;<br />
	&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll never forget that this month of Sundays,&rsquo; said Stickly-Prickly. &lsquo;Hold up my chin, Slow-and-Solid. I&rsquo;m going to try to learn to swim. It may be useful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Excellent!&rsquo; said Slow-and-Solid; and he held up Stickly-Prickly&rsquo;s chin, while Stickly-Prickly kicked in the waters of the turbid Amazon.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll make a fine swimmer yet,&rsquo; said Slow-and-Solid. &lsquo;Now, if you can unlace my back-plates a little, I&rsquo;ll see what I can do towards curling up. It may be useful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Stickly-Prickly helped to unlace Tortoise&rsquo;s back-plates, so that by twisting and straining Slow-and-Solid actually managed to curl up a tiddy wee bit.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Excellent!&rsquo; said Stickly-Prickly; &lsquo;but I shouldn&rsquo;t do any more just now. It&rsquo;s making you black in the face. Kindly lead me into the water once again and I&rsquo;ll practice that side-stroke which you say is so easy.&rsquo; And so Stickly-Prickly practiced, and Slow-Solid swam alongside.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Excellent!&rsquo; said Slow-and-Solid. &lsquo;A little more practice will make you a regular whale. Now, if I may trouble you to unlace my back and front plates two holes more, I&rsquo;ll try that fascinating bend that you say is so easy. Won&rsquo;t Painted Jaguar be surprised!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Excellent!&rsquo; said Stickly-Prickly, all wet from the turbid Amazon. &lsquo;I declare, I shouldn&rsquo;t know you from one of my own family. Two holes, I think, you said? A little more expression, please, and don&rsquo;t grunt quite so much, or Painted Jaguar may hear us. When you&rsquo;ve finished, I want to try that long dive which you say is so easy. Won&rsquo;t Painted Jaguar be surprised!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	And so Stickly-Prickly dived, and Slow-and-Solid dived alongside.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Excellent!&rsquo; said Slow-and-Solid. &lsquo;A little more attention to holding your breath and you will be able to keep house at the bottom of the turbid Amazon. Now I&rsquo;ll try that exercise of putting my hind legs round my ears which you say is so peculiarly comfortable. Won&rsquo;t Painted Jaguar be surprised!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Excellent!&rsquo; said Stickly-Prickly. &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s straining your back-plates a little. They are all overlapping now, instead of lying side by side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the result of exercise,&rsquo; said Slow-and-Solid. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that your prickles seem to be melting into one another, and that you&rsquo;re growing to look rather more like a pinecone, and less like a chestnut-burr, than you used to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Am I?&rsquo; said Stickly-Prickly. &lsquo;That comes from my soaking in the water. Oh, won&rsquo;t Painted Jaguar be surprised!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	They went on with their exercises, each helping the other, till morning came; and when the sun was high they rested and dried themselves. Then they saw that they were both of them quite different from what they had been.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Stickly-Prickly,&rsquo; said Tortoise after breakfast, &lsquo;I am not what I was yesterday; but I think that I may yet amuse Painted Jaguar.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;That was the very thing I was thinking just now,&rsquo; said Stickly-Prickly. &lsquo;I think scales are a tremendous improvement on prickles&mdash;to say nothing of being able to swim. Oh, won&rsquo;t Painted Jaguar be surprised! Let&rsquo;s go and find him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	By and by they found Painted Jaguar, still nursing his paddy-paw that had been hurt the night before. He was so astonished that he fell three times backward over his own painted tail without stopping.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Good morning!&rsquo; said Stickly-Prickly. &lsquo;And how is your dear gracious Mummy this morning?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;She is quite well, thank you,&rsquo; said Painted Jaguar; &lsquo;but you must forgive me if I do not at this precise moment recall your name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;That&rsquo;s unkind of you,&rsquo; said Stickly-Prickly, &lsquo;seeing that this time yesterday you tried to scoop me out of my shell with your paw.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;But you hadn&rsquo;t any shell. It was all prickles,&rsquo; said Painted Jaguar. &lsquo;I know it was. Just look at my paw!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;You told me to drop into the turbid Amazon and be drowned,&rsquo; said Slow-Solid. &lsquo;Why are you so rude and forgetful to-day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember what your mother told you?&rsquo; said Stickly-Prickly,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t curl, but can swim&mdash;<br />
	Stickly-Prickly, that&rsquo;s him!<br />
	Curls up, but can&rsquo;t swim&mdash;<br />
	Slow-Solid, that&rsquo;s him!&rsquo;<br />
	Then they both curled themselves up and rolled round and round Painted Jaguar till his eyes turned truly cart-wheels in his head.</p>
<p>
	Then he went to fetch his mother.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;there are two new animals in the woods to-day, and the one that you said couldn&rsquo;t swim, swims, and the one that you said couldn&rsquo;t curl up, curls; and they&rsquo;ve gone shares in their prickles, I think, because both of them are scaly all over, instead of one being smooth and the other very prickly; and, besides that, they are rolling round and round in circles, and I don&rsquo;t feel comfy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Son, son!&rsquo; said Mother Jaguar ever so many times, graciously waving her tail, &lsquo;a Hedgehog is a Hedgehog, and can&rsquo;t be anything but a Hedgehog; and a Tortoise is a Tortoise, and can never be anything else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;But it isn&rsquo;t a Hedgehog, and it isn&rsquo;t a Tortoise. It&rsquo;s a little bit of both, and I don&rsquo;t know its proper name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; said Mother Jaguar. &lsquo;Everything has its proper name. I should call it &ldquo;Armadillo&rdquo; till I found out the real one. And I should leave it alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	So Painted Jaguar did as he was told, especially about leaving them alone; but the curious thing is that from that day to this, O Best Beloved, no one on the banks of the turbid Amazon has ever called Stickly-Prickly and Slow-Solid anything except Armadillo. There are Hedgehogs and Tortoises in other places, of course (there are some in my garden); but the real old and clever kind, with their scales lying lippety-lappety one over the other, like pine-cone scales, that lived on the banks of the turbid Amazon in the High and Far-Off Days, are always called Armadillos, because they were so clever.</p>
