                <p>
	NOT always was the Kangaroo as now we do behold him, but a Different Animal with four short legs. He was grey and he was woolly, and his pride was inordinate: he danced on an outcrop in the middle of Australia, and he went to the Little God Nqa.</p>
<p>
	He went to Nqa at six before breakfast, saying, &lsquo;Make me different from all other animals by five this afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Up jumped Nqa from his seat on the sandflat and shouted, &lsquo;Go away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	He was grey and he was woolly, and his pride was inordinate: he danced on a rock-ledge in the middle of Australia, and he went to the Middle God Nquing.</p>
<p>
	He went to Nquing at eight after breakfast, saying, &lsquo; Make me different from all other animals; make me, also, wonderfully popular by five this afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Up jumped Nquing from his burrow in the spinifex and shouted, &lsquo;Go away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	He was grey and he was woolly, and his pride was inordinate: he danced on a sandbank in the middle of Australia, and he went to the Big God Nqong.</p>
<p>
	He went to Nqong at ten before dinner-time, saying, &lsquo;Make me different from all other animals; make me popular and wonderfully run after by five this afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Up jumped Nqong from his bath in the salt-pan and shouted, &lsquo;Yes, I will!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Nqong called Dingo&mdash;Yellow-Dog Dingo&mdash;always hungry, dusty in the sunshine, and showed him Kangaroo. Nqong said, &lsquo;Dingo! Wake up, Dingo! Do you see that gentleman dancing on an ashpit? He wants to be popular and very truly run after. Dingo, make him SO!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Up jumped Dingo&mdash;Yellow-Dog Dingo&mdash;and said, &lsquo;What, that cat-rabbit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Off ran Dingo&mdash;Yellow-Dog Dingo&mdash;always hungry, grinning like a coal-scuttle,&mdash;ran after Kangaroo.</p>
<p>
	Off went the proud Kangaroo on his four little legs like a bunny.</p>
<p>
	This, O Beloved of mine, ends the first part of the tale!</p>
<p>
	He ran through the desert; he ran through the mountains; he ran through the salt-pans; he ran through the reed-beds; he ran through the blue gums; he ran through the spinifex; he ran till his front legs ached.</p>
<p>
	He had to!</p>
<p>
	Still ran Dingo&mdash;Yellow-Dog Dingo&mdash;always hungry, grinning like a rat-trap, never getting nearer, never getting farther,&mdash;ran after Kangaroo.</p>
<p>
	He had to!</p>
<p>
	Still ran Kangaroo&mdash;Old Man Kangaroo. He ran through the ti-trees; he ran through the mulga; he ran through the long grass; he ran through the short grass; he ran through the Tropics of Capricorn and Cancer; he ran till his hind legs ached.</p>
<p>
	He had to!</p>
<p>
	Still ran Dingo&mdash;Yellow-Dog Dingo&mdash;hungrier and hungrier, grinning like a horse-collar, never getting nearer, never getting farther; and they came to the Wollgong River.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	Now, there wasn&rsquo;t any bridge, and there wasn&rsquo;t any ferry-boat, and Kangaroo didn&rsquo;t know how to get over; so he stood on his legs and hopped.</p>
<p>
	He had to!</p>
<p>
	He hopped through the Flinders; he hopped through the Cinders; he hopped through the deserts in the middle of Australia. He hopped like a Kangaroo.</p>
<p>
	First he hopped one yard; then he hopped three yards; then he hopped five yards; his legs growing stronger; his legs growing longer. He hadn&rsquo;t any time for rest or refreshment, and he wanted them very much.</p>
<p>
	Still ran Dingo&mdash;Yellow-Dog Dingo&mdash;very much bewildered, very much hungry, and wondering what in the world or out of it made Old Man Kangaroo hop.</p>
<p>
	For he hopped like a cricket; like a pea in a saucepan; or a new rubber ball on a nursery floor.</p>
<p>
	He had to!</p>
<p>
	He tucked up his front legs; he hopped on his hind legs; he stuck out his tail for a balance-weight behind him; and he hopped through the Darling Downs.</p>
<p>
	He had to!</p>
<p>
	Still ran Dingo&mdash;Tired-Dog Dingo&mdash;hungrier and hungrier, very much bewildered, and wondering when in the world or out of it would Old Man Kangaroo stop.</p>
<p>
	Then came Nqong from his bath in the salt-pans, and said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s five o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Down sat Dingo&mdash;Poor Dog Dingo&mdash;always hungry, dusky in the sunshine; hung out his tongue and howled.</p>
<p>
	Down sat Kangaroo&mdash;Old Man Kangaroo&mdash;stuck out his tail like a milking-stool behind him, and said, &lsquo;Thank goodness that&rsquo;s finished!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Then said Nqong, who is always a gentleman, &lsquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you grateful to Yellow-Dog Dingo? Why don&rsquo;t you thank him for all he has done for you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Then said Kangaroo&mdash;Tired Old Kangaroo&mdash;He&rsquo;s chased me out of the homes of my childhood; he&rsquo;s chased me out of my regular meal-times; he&rsquo;s altered my shape so I&rsquo;ll never get it back; and he&rsquo;s played Old Scratch with my legs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Then said Nqong, &lsquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;m mistaken, but didn&rsquo;t you ask me to make you different from all other animals, as well as to make you very truly sought after? And now it is five o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Kangaroo. &lsquo;I wish that I hadn&rsquo;t. I thought you would do it by charms and incantations, but this is a practical joke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Joke!&rsquo; said Nqong from his bath in the blue gums. &lsquo;Say that again and I&rsquo;ll whistle up Dingo and run your hind legs off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the Kangaroo. &lsquo;I must apologise. Legs are legs, and you needn&rsquo;t alter &lsquo;em so far as I am concerned. I only meant to explain to Your Lordliness that I&rsquo;ve had nothing to eat since morning, and I&rsquo;m very empty indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Dingo&mdash;Yellow-Dog Dingo,&mdash;&rsquo;I am just in the same situation. I&rsquo;ve made him different from all other animals; but what may I have for my tea?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Then said Nqong from his bath in the salt-pan, &lsquo;Come and ask me about it tomorrow, because I&rsquo;m going to wash.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	So they were left in the middle of Australia, Old Man Kangaroo and Yellow-Dog Dingo, and each said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s your fault.&rsquo;</p>
