                <p>
	March winds had come and gone; April&#39;s showers were over; May&#39;s buds had opened into flower; and the June sun was shining on the pleasant fields, when John Dolittle at last got back to his own country.</p>
<p>
	But he did not yet go home to Puddleby. First he went traveling through the land with the pushmi&ndash;pullyu in a gipsy&ndash;wagon, stopping at all the country&ndash;fairs. And there, with the acrobats on one side of them and the Punch&ndash;and&ndash;Judy show on the other, they would hang out a big sign which read, &quot;COME AND SEE THE MARVELOUS TWO&ndash;HEADED ANIMAL FROM THE JUNGLES OF AFRICA. Admission SIXPENCE.&quot;</p>
<p>
	And the pushmi&ndash;pullyu would stay inside the wagon, while the other animals would lie about underneath. The Doctor sat in a chair in front taking the sixpences and smiling on the people as they went in; and Dab&ndash;Dab was kept busy all the time scolding him because he would let the children in for nothing when she wasn&#39;t looking.</p>
<p>
	And menagerie&ndash;keepers and circus&ndash;men came and asked the Doctor to sell them the strange creature, saying they would pay a tremendous lot of money for him. But the Doctor always shook his head and said.</p>
<p>
	&quot;No. The pushmi&ndash;pullyu shall never be shut up in a cage. He shall be free always to come and go, like you and me.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Many curious sights and happenings they saw in this wandering life; but they all seemed quite ordinary after the great things they had seen and done in foreign lands. It was very interesting at first, being sort of part of a circus; but after a few weeks they all got dreadfully tired of it and the Doctor and all of them were longing to go home.</p>
<p>
	But so many people came flocking to the little wagon and paid the sixpence to go inside and see the pushmi&ndash;pullyu that very soon the Doctor was able to give up being a showman.</p>
<p>
	And one fine day, when the hollyhocks were in full bloom, he came back to Puddleby a rich man, to live in the little house with the big garden.</p>
<p>
	And the old lame horse in the stable was glad to see him; and so were the swallows who had already built their nests under the eaves of his roof and had young ones. And Dab&ndash;Dab was glad, too, to get back to the house she knew so well&mdash;although there was a terrible lot of dusting to be done, with cobwebs everywhere.</p>
<p>
	And after Jip had gone and shown his golden collar to the conceited collie next&ndash;door, he came back and began running round the garden like a crazy thing, looking for the bones he had buried long ago, and chasing the rats out of the tool&ndash;shed; while Gub&ndash;Gub dug up the horseradish which had grown three feet high in the corner by the garden&ndash;wall.</p>
<p>
	And the Doctor went and saw the sailor who had lent him the boat, and he bought two new ships for him and a rubber&ndash;doll for his baby; and he paid the grocer for the food he had lent him for the journey to Africa. And he bought another piano and put the white mice back in it&mdash;because they said the bureau&ndash;drawer was drafty.</p>
<p>
	Even when the Doctor had filled the old money&ndash;box on the dresser&ndash;shelf, he still had a lot of money left; and he had to get three more money&ndash;boxes, just as big, to put the rest in.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Money,&quot; he said, &quot;is a terrible nuisance. But it&#39;s nice not to have to worry.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Yes,&quot; said Dab&ndash;Dab, who was toasting muffins for his tea, &quot;it is indeed!&quot;</p>
<p>
	And when the Winter came again, and the snow flew against the kitchen&ndash;window, the Doctor and his animals would sit round the big, warm fire after supper; and he would read aloud to them out of his books.</p>
<p>
	But far away in Africa, where the monkeys chattered in the palm&ndash;trees before they went to bed under the big yellow moon, they would say to one another,</p>
<p>
	&quot;I wonder what The Good Man&#39;s doing now&mdash;over there, in the Land of the White Men! Do you think he ever will come back?&quot;</p>
<p>
	And Polynesia would squeak out from the vines,</p>
<p>
	&quot;I think he will&mdash;I guess he will&mdash;I hope he will!&quot;</p>
<p>
	And then the crocodile would grunt up at them from the black mud of the river,</p>
<p>
	&quot;I&#39;m SURE he will&mdash;Go to sleep!&quot;</p>
