                <p>
	Having thanked the sharks again for their kindness, the Doctor and his pets set off once more on their journey home in the swift ship with the three red sails.</p>
<p>
	As they moved out into the open sea, the animals all went downstairs to see what their new boat was like inside; while the Doctor leant on the rail at the back of the ship with a pipe in his mouth, watching the Canary Islands fade away in the blue dusk of the evening.</p>
<p>
	While he was standing there, wondering how the monkeys were getting on&mdash;and what his garden would look like when he got back to Puddleby, Dab&ndash;Dab came tumbling up the stairs, all smiles and full of news.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Doctor!&quot; she cried. &quot;This ship of the pirates is simply beautiful&mdash;absolutely. The beds downstairs are made of primrose silk&mdash;with hundreds of big pillows and cushions; there are thick, soft carpets on the floors; the dishes are made of silver; and there are all sorts of good things to eat and drink&mdash;special things; the larder&mdash;well, it&#39;s just like a shop, that&#39;s all. You never saw anything like it in your life&mdash; Just think&mdash;they kept five different kinds of sardines, those men! Come and look.... Oh, and we found a little room down there with the door locked; and we are all crazy to get in and see what&#39;s inside. Jip says it must be where the pirates kept their treasure. But we can&#39;t open the door. Come down and see if you can let us in.&quot;</p>
<p>
	So the Doctor went downstairs and he saw that it was indeed a beautiful ship. He found the animals gathered round a little door, all talking at once, trying to guess what was inside. The Doctor turned the handle but it wouldn&#39;t open. Then they all started to hunt for the key. They looked under the mat; they looked under all the carpets; they looked in all the cupboards and drawers and lockers&mdash;in the big chests in the ship&#39;s dining&ndash;room; they looked everywhere.</p>
<p>
	While they were doing this they discovered a lot of new and wonderful things that the pirates must have stolen from other ships: Kashmir shawls as thin as a cobweb, embroidered with flowers of gold; jars of fine tobacco from Jamaica; carved ivory boxes full of Russian tea; an old violin with a string broken and a picture on the back; a set of big chess&ndash;men, carved out of coral and amber; a walking&ndash;stick which had a sword inside it when you pulled the handle; six wine&ndash;glasses with turquoise and silver round the rims; and a lovely great sugar&ndash;bowl, made of mother o&#39; pearl. But nowhere in the whole boat could they find a key to fit that lock.</p>
<p>
	So they all came back to the door, and Jip peered through the key&ndash;hole. But something had been stood against the wall on the inside and he could see nothing.</p>
<p>
	While they were standing around, wondering what they should do, the owl, Too&ndash;Too, suddenly said,</p>
<p>
	&quot;Sh!&mdash;Listen!&mdash;I do believe there&#39;s some one in there!&quot;</p>
<p>
	They all kept still a moment. Then the Doctor said,</p>
<p>
	&quot;You must be mistaken, Too&ndash;Too. I don&#39;t hear anything.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I&#39;m sure of it,&quot; said the owl. &quot;Sh!&mdash;There it is again&mdash;Don&#39;t you hear that?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;No, I do not,&quot; said the Doctor. &quot;What kind of a sound is it?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I hear the noise of some one putting his hand in his pocket,&quot; said the owl.</p>
<p>
	&quot;But that makes hardly any sound at all,&quot; said the Doctor. &quot;You couldn&#39;t hear that out here.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Pardon me, but I can,&quot; said Too&ndash;Too. &quot;I tell you there is some one on the other side of that door putting his hand in his pocket. Almost everything makes SOME noise&mdash;if your ears are only sharp enough to catch it. Bats can hear a mole walking in his tunnel under the earth&mdash;and they think they&#39;re good hearers. But we owls can tell you, using only one ear, the color of a kitten from the way it winks in the dark.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Well, well!&quot; said the Doctor. &quot;You surprise me. That&#39;s very interesting.... Listen again and tell me what he&#39;s doing now.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I&#39;m not sure yet,&quot; said Too&ndash;Too, &quot;if it&#39;s a man at all. Maybe it&#39;s a woman. Lift me up and let me listen at the key&ndash;hole and I&#39;ll soon tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>
	So the Doctor lifted the owl up and held him close to the lock of the door.</p>
<p>
	After a moment Too&ndash;Too said,</p>
<p>
	&quot;Now he&#39;s rubbing his face with his left hand. It is a small hand and a small face. It MIGHT be a woman&mdash;No. Now he pushes his hair back off his forehead&mdash;It&#39;s a man all right.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Women sometimes do that,&quot; said the Doctor.</p>
<p>
	&quot;True,&quot; said the owl. &quot;But when they do, their long hair makes quite a different sound.... Sh! Make that fidgety pig keep still. Now all hold your breath a moment so I can listen well. This is very difficult, what I&#39;m doing now&mdash;and the pesky door is so thick! Sh! Everybody quite still&mdash;shut your eyes and don&#39;t breathe.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Too&ndash;Too leaned down and listened again very hard and long.</p>
<p>
	At last he looked up into the Doctor&#39;s face and said,</p>
<p>
	&quot;The man in there is unhappy. He weeps. He has taken care not to blubber or sniffle, lest we should find out that he is crying. But I heard&mdash;quite distinctly&mdash;the sound of a tear falling on his sleeve.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;How do you know it wasn&#39;t a drop of water falling off the ceiling on him?&quot; asked Gub&ndash;Gub. &quot;Pshaw!&mdash;Such ignorance!&quot; sniffed Too&ndash;Too. &quot;A drop of water falling off the ceiling would have made ten times as much noise!&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Well,&quot; said the Doctor, &quot;if the poor fellow&#39;s unhappy, we&#39;ve got to get in and see what&#39;s the matter with him. Find me an axe, and I&#39;ll chop the door down.&quot;</p>
