                <p>
	And now my written story ends. I look back, once more&mdash;for the last time&mdash;before I close these leaves.</p>
<p>
	I see myself, with Agnes at my side, journeying along the road of life. I see our children and our friends around us; and I hear the roar of many voices, not indifferent to me as I travel on.</p>
<p>
	What faces are the most distinct to me in the fleeting crowd? Lo, these; all turning to me as I ask my thoughts the question!</p>
<p>
	Here is my aunt, in stronger spectacles, an old woman of four&ndash;score years and more, but upright yet, and a steady walker of six miles at a stretch in winter weather.</p>
<p>
	Always with her, here comes Peggotty, my good old nurse, likewise in spectacles, accustomed to do needle&ndash;work at night very close to the lamp, but never sitting down to it without a bit of wax candle, a yard&ndash;measure in a little house, and a work&ndash;box with a picture of St. Paul&#39;s upon the lid.</p>
<p>
	The cheeks and arms of Peggotty, so hard and red in my childish days, when I wondered why the birds didn&#39;t peck her in preference to apples, are shrivelled now; and her eyes, that used to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face, are fainter (though they glitter still); but her rough forefinger, which I once associated with a pocket nutmeg&ndash;grater, is just the same, and when I see my least child catching at it as it totters from my aunt to her, I think of our little parlour at home, when I could scarcely walk. My aunt&#39;s old disappointment is set right, now. She is godmother to a real living Betsey Trotwood; and Dora (the next in order) says she spoils her.</p>
<p>
	There is something bulky in Peggotty&#39;s pocket. It is nothing smaller than the Crocodile Book, which is in rather a dilapidated condition by this time, with divers of the leaves torn and stitched across, but which Peggotty exhibits to the children as a precious relic. I find it very curious to see my own infant face, looking up at me from the Crocodile stories; and to be reminded by it of my old acquaintance Brooks of Sheffield.</p>
<p>
	Among my boys, this summer holiday time, I see an old man making giant kites, and gazing at them in the air, with a delight for which there are no words. He greets me rapturously, and whispers, with many nods and winks, &#39;Trotwood, you will be glad to hear that I shall finish the Memorial when I have nothing else to do, and that your aunt&#39;s the most extraordinary woman in the world, sir!&#39;</p>
<p>
	Who is this bent lady, supporting herself by a stick, and showing me a countenance in which there are some traces of old pride and beauty, feebly contending with a querulous, imbecile, fretful wandering of the mind? She is in a garden; and near her stands a sharp, dark, withered woman, with a white scar on her lip. Let me hear what they say.</p>
<p>
	&#39;Rosa, I have forgotten this gentleman&#39;s name.&#39;</p>
<p>
	Rosa bends over her, and calls to her, &#39;Mr. Copperfield.&#39;</p>
<p>
	&#39;I am glad to see you, sir. I am sorry to observe you are in mourning. I hope Time will be good to you.&#39;</p>
<p>
	Her impatient attendant scolds her, tells her I am not in mourning, bids her look again, tries to rouse her.</p>
<p>
	&#39;You have seen my son, sir,&#39; says the elder lady. &#39;Are you reconciled?&#39;</p>
<p>
	Looking fixedly at me, she puts her hand to her forehead, and moans. Suddenly, she cries, in a terrible voice, &#39;Rosa, come to me. He is dead!&#39; Rosa kneeling at her feet, by turns caresses her, and quarrels with her; now fiercely telling her, &#39;I loved him better than you ever did!&#39;&ndash; now soothing her to sleep on her breast, like a sick child. Thus I leave them; thus I always find them; thus they wear their time away, from year to year.</p>
<p>
	What ship comes sailing home from India, and what English lady is this, married to a growling old Scotch Croesus with great flaps of ears? Can this be Julia Mills?</p>
<p>
	Indeed it is Julia Mills, peevish and fine, with a black man to carry cards and letters to her on a golden salver, and a copper&ndash;coloured woman in linen, with a bright handkerchief round her head, to serve her Tiffin in her dressing&ndash;room. But Julia keeps no diary in these days; never sings Affection&#39;s Dirge; eternally quarrels with the old Scotch Croesus, who is a sort of yellow bear with a tanned hide. Julia is steeped in money to the throat, and talks and thinks of nothing else. I liked her better in the Desert of Sahara.</p>
<p>
	Or perhaps this IS the Desert of Sahara! For, though Julia has a stately house, and mighty company, and sumptuous dinners every day, I see no green growth near her; nothing that can ever come to fruit or flower. What Julia calls &#39;society&#39;, I see; among it Mr. Jack Maldon, from his Patent Place, sneering at the hand that gave it him, and speaking to me of the Doctor as &#39;so charmingly antique&#39;. But when society is the name for such hollow gentlemen and ladies, Julia, and when its breeding is professed indifference to everything that can advance or can retard mankind, I think we must have lost ourselves in that same Desert of Sahara, and had better find the way out.</p>
<p>
	And lo, the Doctor, always our good friend, labouring at his Dictionary (somewhere about the letter D), and happy in his home and wife. Also the Old Soldier, on a considerably reduced footing, and by no means so influential as in days of yore!</p>
<p>
	Working at his chambers in the Temple, with a busy aspect, and his hair (where he is not bald) made more rebellious than ever by the constant friction of his lawyer&#39;s&ndash;wig, I come, in a later time, upon my dear old Traddles. His table is covered with thick piles of papers; and I say, as I look around me:</p>
<p>
	&#39;If Sophy were your clerk, now, Traddles, she would have enough to do!&#39;</p>
<p>
	&#39;You may say that, my dear Copperfield! But those were capital days, too, in Holborn Court! Were they not?&#39;</p>
<p>
	&#39;When she told you you would be a judge? But it was not the town talk then!&#39;</p>
<p>
	&#39;At all events,&#39; says Traddles, &#39;if I ever am one &ndash;&#39; &#39;Why, you know you will be.&#39;</p>
<p>
	&#39;Well, my dear Copperfield, WHEN I am one, I shall tell the story, as I said I would.&#39;</p>
<p>
	We walk away, arm in arm. I am going to have a family dinner with Traddles. It is Sophy&#39;s birthday; and, on our road, Traddles discourses to me of the good fortune he has enjoyed.</p>
<p>
	&#39;I really have been able, my dear Copperfield, to do all that I had most at heart. There&#39;s the Reverend Horace promoted to that living at four hundred and fifty pounds a year; there are our two boys receiving the very best education, and distinguishing themselves as steady scholars and good fellows; there are three of the girls married very comfortably; there are three more living with us; there are three more keeping house for the Reverend Horace since Mrs. Crewler&#39;s decease; and all of them happy.&#39;</p>
<p>
	&#39;Except &ndash;&#39; I suggest.</p>
<p>
	&#39;Except the Beauty,&#39; says Traddles. &#39;Yes. It was very unfortunate that she should marry such a vagabond. But there was a certain dash and glare about him that caught her. However, now we have got her safe at our house, and got rid of him, we must cheer her up again.&#39;</p>
<p>
	Traddles&#39;s house is one of the very houses&mdash;or it easily may have been&mdash;which he and Sophy used to parcel out, in their evening walks. It is a large house; but Traddles keeps his papers in his dressing&ndash;room and his boots with his papers; and he and Sophy squeeze themselves into upper rooms, reserving the best bedrooms for the Beauty and the girls. There is no room to spare in the house; for more of &#39;the girls&#39; are here, and always are here, by some accident or other, than I know how to count. Here, when we go in, is a crowd of them, running down to the door, and handing Traddles about to be kissed, until he is out of breath. Here, established in perpetuity, is the poor Beauty, a widow with a little girl; here, at dinner on Sophy&#39;s birthday, are the three married girls with their three husbands, and one of the husband&#39;s brothers, and another husband&#39;s cousin, and another husband&#39;s sister, who appears to me to be engaged to the cousin. Traddles, exactly the same simple, unaffected fellow as he ever was, sits at the foot of the large table like a Patriarch; and Sophy beams upon him, from the head, across a cheerful space that is certainly not glittering with Britannia metal.</p>
<p>
	And now, as I close my task, subduing my desire to linger yet, these faces fade away. But one face, shining on me like a Heavenly light by which I see all other objects, is above them and beyond them all. And that remains.</p>
<p>
	I turn my head, and see it, in its beautiful serenity, beside me.</p>
<p>
	My lamp burns low, and I have written far into the night; but the dear presence, without which I were nothing, bears me company.</p>
<p>
	O Agnes, O my soul, so may thy face be by me when I close my life indeed; so may I, when realities are melting from me, like the shadows which I now dismiss, still find thee near me, pointing upward!</p>
