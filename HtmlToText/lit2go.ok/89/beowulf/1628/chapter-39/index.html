	&quot;THE bloody swath of Swedes and Geats<br />
	and the storm of their strife, were seen afar,<br />
	how folk against folk the fight had wakened.<br />
	The ancient king with his atheling band<br />
	sought his citadel, sorrowing much:<br />
	Ongentheow earl went up to his burg.<br />
	He had tested Hygelac&#39;s hardihood,<br />
	the proud one&#39;s prowess, would prove it no longer,<br />
	defied no more those fighting-wanderers<br />
	nor hoped from the seamen to save his hoard,<br />
	his bairn and his bride: so he bent him again,<br />
	old, to his earth-walls. Yet after him came<br />
	with slaughter for Swedes the standards of Hygelac<br />
	o&#39;er peaceful plains in pride advancing,<br />
	till Hrethelings fought in the fenced town. [footnote 1]<br />
	Then Ongentheow with edge of sword,<br />
	the hoary-bearded, was held at bay,<br />
	and the folk-king there was forced to suffer<br />
	Eofor&#39;s anger. In ire, at the king<br />
	Wulf Wonreding with weapon struck;<br />
	and the chieftain&#39;s blood, for that blow, in streams<br />
	flowed &#39;neath his hair. No fear felt he,<br />
	stout old Scylfing, but straightway repaid<br />
	in better bargain that bitter stroke<br />
	and faced his foe with fell intent.<br />
	Nor swift enough was the son of Wonred<br />
	answer to render the aged chief;<br />
	too soon on his head the helm was cloven;<br />
	blood-bedecked he bowed to earth,<br />
	and fell adown; not doomed was he yet,<br />
	and well he waxed, though the wound was sore.<br />
	Then the hardy Hygelac-thane, [footnote 2]<br />
	when his brother fell, with broad brand smote,<br />
	giants&#39; sword crashing through giants&#39;-helm<br />
	across the shield-wall: sank the king,<br />
	his folk&#39;s old herdsman, fatally hurt.<br />
	There were many to bind the brother&#39;s wounds<br />
	and lift him, fast as fate allowed<br />
	his people to wield the place-of-war.<br />
	But Eofor took from Ongentheow,<br />
	earl from other, the iron-breastplate,<br />
	hard sword hilted, and helmet too,<br />
	and the hoar-chief&#39;s harness to Hygelac carried,<br />
	who took the trappings, and truly promised<br />
	rich fee &#39;mid folk, &mdash; and fulfilled it so.<br />
	For that grim strife gave the Geatish lord,<br />
	Hrethel&#39;s offspring, when home he came,<br />
	to Eofor and Wulf a wealth of treasure,<br />
	Each of them had a hundred thousand [footnote 3]<br />
	in land and linked rings; nor at less price reckoned<br />
	mid-earth men such mighty deeds!<br />
	And to Eofor he gave his only daughter<br />
	in pledge of grace, the pride of his home.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Such is the feud, the foeman&#39;s rage,<br />
	death-hate of men: so I deem it sure<br />
	that the Swedish folk will seek us home<br />
	for this fall of their friends, the fighting-Scylfings,<br />
	when once they learn that our warrior leader<br />
	lifeless lies, who land and hoard<br />
	ever defended from all his foes,<br />
	furthered his folk&#39;s weal, finished his course<br />
	a hardy hero. &mdash; Now haste is best,<br />
	that we go to gaze on our Geatish lord,<br />
	and bear the bountiful breaker-of-rings<br />
	to the funeral pyre. No fragments merely<br />
	shall burn with the warrior. Wealth of jewels,<br />
	gold untold and gained in terror,<br />
	treasure at last with his life obtained,<br />
	all of that booty the brands shall take,<br />
	fire shall eat it. No earl must carry<br />
	memorial jewel. No maiden fair<br />
	shall wreathe her neck with noble ring:<br />
	nay, sad in spirit and shorn of her gold,<br />
	oft shall she pass o&#39;er paths of exile<br />
	now our lord all laughter has laid aside,<br />
	all mirth and revel. Many a spear<br />
	morning-cold shall be clasped amain,<br />
	lifted aloft; nor shall lilt of harp<br />
	those warriors wake; but the wan-hued raven,<br />
	fain o&#39;er the fallen, his feast shall praise<br />
	and boast to the eagle how bravely he ate<br />
	when he and the wolf were wasting the slain.&quot;</p>
<p>
	So he told his sorrowful tidings,<br />
	and little [footnote 4] he lied, the loyal man<br />
	of word or of work. The warriors rose;<br />
	sad, they climbed to the Cliff-of-Eagles,<br />
	went, welling with tears, the wonder to view.<br />
	Found on the sand there, stretched at rest,<br />
	their lifeless lord, who had lavished rings<br />
	of old upon them. Ending-day<br />
	had dawned on the doughty-one; death had seized<br />
	in woful slaughter the Weders&#39; king.<br />
	There saw they, besides, the strangest being,<br />
	loathsome, lying their leader near,<br />
	prone on the field. The fiery dragon,<br />
	fearful fiend, with flame was scorched.<br />
	Reckoned by feet, it was fifty measures<br />
	in length as it lay. Aloft erewhile<br />
	it had revelled by night, and anon come back,<br />
	seeking its den; now in death&#39;s sure clutch<br />
	it had come to the end of its earth-hall joys.<br />
	By it there stood the stoups and jars;<br />
	dishes lay there, and dear-decked swords<br />
	eaten with rust, as, on earth&#39;s lap resting,<br />
	a thousand winters they waited there.<br />
	For all that heritage huge, that gold<br />
	of bygone men, was bound by a spell, [footnote 5]<br />
	so the treasure-hall could be touched by none<br />
	of human kind, &mdash; save that Heaven&#39;s King,<br />
	God himself, might give whom he would,<br />
	Helper of Heroes, the hoard to open, &mdash;<br />
	even such a man as seemed to him meet.</p>
