	&quot;THEN he goes to his chamber, a grief-song chants<br />
	alone for his lost. Too large all seems,<br />
	homestead and house. So the helmet-of-Weders<br />
	hid in his heart for Herebeald<br />
	waves of woe. No way could he take<br />
	to avenge on the slayer slaughter so foul;<br />
	nor e&#39;en could he harass that hero at all<br />
	with loathing deed, though he loved him not.<br />
	And so for the sorrow his soul endured,<br />
	men&#39;s gladness he gave up and God&#39;s light chose.<br />
	Lands and cities he left his sons<br />
	(as the wealthy do) when he went from earth.<br />
	There was strife and struggle &#39;twixt Swede and Geat<br />
	o&#39;er the width of waters; war arose,<br />
	hard battle-horror, when Hrethel died,<br />
	and Ongentheow&#39;s offspring grew<br />
	strife-keen, bold, nor brooked o&#39;er the seas<br />
	pact of peace, but pushed their hosts<br />
	to harass in hatred by Hreosnabeorh.<br />
	Men of my folk for that feud had vengeance,<br />
	for woful war (&#39;tis widely known),<br />
	though one of them bought it with blood of his heart,<br />
	a bargain hard: for Haethcyn proved<br />
	fatal that fray, for the first-of-Geats.<br />
	At morn, I heard, was the murderer killed<br />
	by kinsman for kinsman, [footnote 1] with clash of sword,<br />
	when Ongentheow met Eofor there.<br />
	Wide split the war-helm: wan he fell,<br />
	hoary Scylfing; the hand that smote him<br />
	of feud was mindful, nor flinched from the death-blow.</p>
<p>
	&mdash; &quot;For all that he [footnote 2] gave me, my gleaming sword<br />
	repaid him at war, &mdash; such power I wielded, &mdash;<br />
	for lordly treasure: with land he entrusted me,<br />
	homestead and house. He had no need<br />
	from Swedish realm, or from Spear-Dane folk,<br />
	or from men of the Gifths, to get him help, &mdash;<br />
	some warrior worse for wage to buy!<br />
	Ever I fought in the front of all,<br />
	sole to the fore; and so shall I fight<br />
	while I bide in life and this blade shall last<br />
	that early and late hath loyal proved<br />
	since for my doughtiness Daeghrefn fell,<br />
	slain by my hand, the Hugas&#39; champion.<br />
	Nor fared he thence to the Frisian king<br />
	with the booty back, and breast-adornments;<br />
	but, slain in struggle, that standard-bearer<br />
	fell, atheling brave. Not with blade was he slain,<br />
	but his bones were broken by brawny gripe,<br />
	his heart-waves stilled. &mdash; The sword-edge now,<br />
	hard blade and my hand, for the hoard shall strive.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Beowulf spake, and a battle-vow made<br />
	his last of all: &quot;I have lived through many<br />
	wars in my youth; now once again,<br />
	old folk-defender, feud will I seek,<br />
	do doughty deeds, if the dark destroyer<br />
	forth from his cavern come to fight me!&quot;<br />
	Then hailed he the helmeted heroes all,<br />
	for the last time greeting his liegemen dear,<br />
	comrades of war: &quot;I should carry no weapon,<br />
	no sword to the serpent, if sure I knew<br />
	how, with such enemy, else my vows<br />
	I could gain as I did in Grendel&#39;s day.<br />
	But fire in this fight I must fear me now,<br />
	and poisonous breath; so I bring with me<br />
	breastplate and board. [footnote 3] From the barrow&#39;s keeper<br />
	no footbreadth flee I. One fight shall end<br />
	our war by the wall, as Wyrd allots,<br />
	all mankind&#39;s master. My mood is bold<br />
	but forbears to boast o&#39;er this battling-flyer.<br />
	&mdash; Now abide by the barrow, ye breastplate-mailed,<br />
	ye heroes in harness, which of us twain<br />
	better from battle-rush bear his wounds.<br />
	Wait ye the finish. The fight is not yours,<br />
	nor meet for any but me alone<br />
	to measure might with this monster here<br />
	and play the hero. Hardily I<br />
	shall win that wealth, or war shall seize,<br />
	cruel killing, your king and lord!&quot;</p>
<p>
	Up stood then with shield the sturdy champion,<br />
	stayed by the strength of his single manhood,<br />
	and hardy &#39;neath helmet his harness bore<br />
	under cleft of the cliffs: no coward&#39;s path!<br />
	Soon spied by the wall that warrior chief,<br />
	survivor of many a victory-field<br />
	where foemen fought with furious clashings,<br />
	an arch of stone; and within, a stream<br />
	that broke from the barrow. The brooklet&#39;s wave<br />
	was hot with fire. The hoard that way<br />
	he never could hope unharmed to near,<br />
	or endure those deeps, [footnote 4] for the dragon&#39;s flame.<br />
	Then let from his breast, for he burst with rage,<br />
	the Weder-Geat prince a word outgo;<br />
	stormed the stark-heart; stern went ringing<br />
	and clear his cry &#39;neath the cliff-rocks gray.<br />
	The hoard-guard heard a human voice;<br />
	his rage was enkindled. No respite now<br />
	for pact of peace! The poison-breath<br />
	of that foul worm first came forth from the cave,<br />
	hot reek-of-fight: the rocks resounded.<br />
	Stout by the stone-way his shield he raised,<br />
	lord of the Geats, against the loathed-one;<br />
	while with courage keen that coiled foe<br />
	came seeking strife. The sturdy king<br />
	had drawn his sword, not dull of edge,<br />
	heirloom old; and each of the two<br />
	felt fear of his foe, though fierce their mood.<br />
	Stoutly stood with his shield high-raised<br />
	the warrior king, as the worm now coiled<br />
	together amain: the mailed-one waited.<br />
	Now, spire by spire, fast sped and glided<br />
	that blazing serpent. The shield protected,<br />
	soul and body a shorter while<br />
	for the hero-king than his heart desired,<br />
	could his will have wielded the welcome respite<br />
	but once in his life! But Wyrd denied it,<br />
	and victory&#39;s honors. &mdash; His arm he lifted<br />
	lord of the Geats, the grim foe smote<br />
	with atheling&#39;s heirloom. Its edge was turned<br />
	brown blade, on the bone, and bit more feebly<br />
	than its noble master had need of then<br />
	in his baleful stress. &mdash; Then the barrow&#39;s keeper<br />
	waxed full wild for that weighty blow,<br />
	cast deadly flames; wide drove and far<br />
	those vicious fires. No victor&#39;s glory<br />
	the Geats&#39; lord boasted; his brand had failed,<br />
	naked in battle, as never it should,<br />
	excellent iron! &mdash; &#39;Twas no easy path<br />
	that Ecgtheow&#39;s honored heir must tread<br />
	over the plain to the place of the foe;<br />
	for against his will he must win a home<br />
	elsewhere far, as must all men, leaving<br />
	this lapsing life! &mdash; Not long it was<br />
	ere those champions grimly closed again.<br />
	The hoard-guard was heartened; high heaved his breast<br />
	once more; and by peril was pressed again,<br />
	enfolded in flames, the folk-commander!<br />
	Nor yet about him his band of comrades,<br />
	sons of athelings, armed stood<br />
	with warlike front: to the woods they bent them,<br />
	their lives to save. But the soul of one<br />
	with care was cumbered. Kinship true<br />
	can never be marred in a noble mind!</p>
