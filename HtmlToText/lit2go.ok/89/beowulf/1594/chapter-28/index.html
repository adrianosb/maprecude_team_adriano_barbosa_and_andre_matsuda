                <p>
	HASTENED the hardy one, henchmen with him,<br />
	sandy strand of the sea to tread<br />
	and widespread ways. The world&#39;s great candle,<br />
	sun shone from south. They strode along<br />
	with sturdy steps to the spot they knew<br />
	where the battle-king young, his burg within,<br />
	slayer of Ongentheow, shared the rings,<br />
	shelter-of-heroes. To Hygelac<br />
	Beowulf&#39;s coming was quickly told, &mdash;<br />
	that there in the court the clansmen&#39;s refuge,<br />
	the shield-companion sound and alive,<br />
	hale from the hero-play homeward strode.<br />
	With haste in the hall, by highest order,<br />
	room for the rovers was readily made.<br />
	By his sovran he sat, come safe from battle,<br />
	kinsman by kinsman. His kindly lord<br />
	he first had greeted in gracious form,<br />
	with manly words. The mead dispensing,<br />
	came through the high hall Haereth&#39;s daughter,<br />
	winsome to warriors, wine-cup bore<br />
	to the hands of the heroes. Hygelac then<br />
	his comrade fairly with question plied<br />
	in the lofty hall, sore longing to know<br />
	what manner of sojourn the Sea-Geats made.<br />
	&quot;What came of thy quest, my kinsman Beowulf,<br />
	when thy yearnings suddenly swept thee yonder<br />
	battle to seek o&#39;er the briny sea,<br />
	combat in Heorot? Hrothgar couldst thou<br />
	aid at all, the honored chief,<br />
	in his wide-known woes? With waves of care<br />
	my sad heart seethed; I sore mistrusted<br />
	my loved one&#39;s venture: long I begged thee<br />
	by no means to seek that slaughtering monster,<br />
	but suffer the South-Danes to settle their feud<br />
	themselves with Grendel. Now God be thanked<br />
	that safe and sound I can see thee now!&quot;</p>
<p>
	Beowulf spake, the bairn of Ecgtheow:&mdash;<br />
	&quot;&#39;Tis known and unhidden, Hygelac Lord,<br />
	to many men, that meeting of ours,<br />
	struggle grim between Grendel and me,<br />
	which we fought on the field where full too many<br />
	sorrows he wrought for the Scylding-Victors,<br />
	evils unending. These all I avenged.<br />
	No boast can be from breed of Grendel,<br />
	any on earth, for that uproar at dawn,<br />
	from the longest-lived of the loathsome race<br />
	in fleshly fold! &mdash; But first I went<br />
	Hrothgar to greet in the hall of gifts,<br />
	where Healfdene&#39;s kinsman high-renowned,<br />
	soon as my purpose was plain to him,<br />
	assigned me a seat by his son and heir.<br />
	The liegemen were lusty; my life-days never<br />
	such merry men over mead in hall<br />
	have I heard under heaven! The high-born queen,<br />
	people&#39;s peace-bringer, passed through the hall,<br />
	cheered the young clansmen, clasps of gold,<br />
	ere she sought her seat, to sundry gave.<br />
	Oft to the heroes Hrothgar&#39;s daughter,<br />
	to earls in turn, the ale-cup tendered, &mdash;<br />
	she whom I heard these hall-companions<br />
	Freawaru name, when fretted gold<br />
	she proffered the warriors. Promised is she,<br />
	gold-decked maid, to the glad son of Froda.<br />
	Sage this seems to the Scylding&#39;s-friend,<br />
	kingdom&#39;s-keeper: he counts it wise<br />
	the woman to wed so and ward off feud,<br />
	store of slaughter. But seldom ever<br />
	when men are slain, does the murder-spear sink<br />
	but briefest while, though the bride be fair! [footnote 1]</p>
<p>
	&quot;Nor haply will like it the Heathobard lord,<br />
	and as little each of his liegemen all,<br />
	when a thane of the Danes, in that doughty throng,<br />
	goes with the lady along their hall,<br />
	and on him the old-time heirlooms glisten<br />
	hard and ring-decked, Heathobard&#39;s treasure,<br />
	weapons that once they wielded fair<br />
	until they lost at the linden-play [footnote 2]<br />
	liegeman leal and their lives as well.<br />
	Then, over the ale, on this heirloom gazing,<br />
	some ash-wielder old who has all in mind<br />
	that spear-death of men, [footnote 3] &mdash; he is stern of mood,<br />
	heavy at heart, &mdash; in the hero young<br />
	tests the temper and tries the soul<br />
	and war-hate wakens, with words like these:&mdash;<br />
	Canst thou not, comrade, ken that sword<br />
	which to the fray thy father carried<br />
	in his final feud, &#39;neath the fighting-mask,<br />
	dearest of blades, when the Danish slew him<br />
	and wielded the war-place on Withergild&#39;s fall,<br />
	after havoc of heroes, those hardy Scyldings?<br />
	Now, the son of a certain slaughtering Dane,<br />
	proud of his treasure, paces this hall,<br />
	joys in the killing, and carries the jewel [footnote 4]<br />
	that rightfully ought to be owned by thee!<br />
	Thus he urges and eggs him all the time<br />
	with keenest words, till occasion offers<br />
	that Freawaru&#39;s thane, for his father&#39;s deed,<br />
	after bite of brand in his blood must slumber,<br />
	losing his life; but that liegeman flies<br />
	living away, for the land he kens.<br />
	And thus be broken on both their sides<br />
	oaths of the earls, when Ingeld&#39;s breast<br />
	wells with war-hate, and wife-love now<br />
	after the care-billows cooler grows.<br />
	&quot;So [footnote 5] I hold not high the Heathobards&#39; faith<br />
	due to the Danes, or their during love<br />
	and pact of peace. &mdash; But I pass from that,<br />
	turning to Grendel, O giver-of-treasure,<br />
	and saying in full how the fight resulted,<br />
	hand-fray of heroes. When heaven&#39;s jewel<br />
	had fled o&#39;er far fields, that fierce sprite came,<br />
	night-foe savage, to seek us out<br />
	where safe and sound we sentried the hall.<br />
	To Hondscio then was that harassing deadly,<br />
	his fall there was fated. He first was slain,<br />
	girded warrior. Grendel on him<br />
	turned murderous mouth, on our mighty kinsman,<br />
	and all of the brave man&#39;s body devoured.<br />
	Yet none the earlier, empty-handed,<br />
	would the bloody-toothed murderer, mindful of bale,<br />
	outward go from the gold-decked hall:<br />
	but me he attacked in his terror of might,<br />
	with greedy hand grasped me. A glove hung by him [footnote 6]<br />
	wide and wondrous, wound with bands;<br />
	and in artful wise it all was wrought,<br />
	by devilish craft, of dragon-skins.<br />
	Me therein, an innocent man,<br />
	the fiendish foe was fain to thrust<br />
	with many another. He might not so,<br />
	when I all angrily upright stood.<br />
	&#39;Twere long to relate how that land-destroyer<br />
	I paid in kind for his cruel deeds;<br />
	yet there, my prince, this people of thine<br />
	got fame by my fighting. He fled away,<br />
	and a little space his life preserved;<br />
	but there staid behind him his stronger hand<br />
	left in Heorot; heartsick thence<br />
	on the floor of the ocean that outcast fell.<br />
	Me for this struggle the Scyldings&#39;-friend<br />
	paid in plenty with plates of gold,<br />
	with many a treasure, when morn had come<br />
	and we all at the banquet-board sat down.<br />
	Then was song and glee. The gray-haired Scylding,<br />
	much tested, told of the times of yore.<br />
	Whiles the hero his harp bestirred,<br />
	wood-of-delight; now lays he chanted<br />
	of sooth and sadness, or said aright<br />
	legends of wonder, the wide-hearted king;<br />
	or for years of his youth he would yearn at times,<br />
	for strength of old struggles, now stricken with age,<br />
	hoary hero: his heart surged full<br />
	when, wise with winters, he wailed their flight.<br />
	Thus in the hall the whole of that day<br />
	at ease we feasted, till fell o&#39;er earth<br />
	another night. Anon full ready<br />
	in greed of vengeance, Grendel&#39;s mother<br />
	set forth all doleful. Dead was her son<br />
	through war-hate of Weders; now, woman monstrous<br />
	with fury fell a foeman she slew,<br />
	avenged her offspring. From Aeschere old,<br />
	loyal councillor, life was gone;<br />
	nor might they e&#39;en, when morning broke,<br />
	those Danish people, their death-done comrade<br />
	burn with brands, on balefire lay<br />
	the man they mourned. Under mountain stream<br />
	she had carried the corpse with cruel hands.<br />
	For Hrothgar that was the heaviest sorrow<br />
	of all that had laden the lord of his folk.<br />
	The leader then, by thy life, besought me<br />
	(sad was his soul) in the sea-waves&#39; coil<br />
	to play the hero and hazard my being<br />
	for glory of prowess: my guerdon he pledged.<br />
	I then in the waters &mdash; &#39;tis widely known &mdash;<br />
	that sea-floor-guardian savage found.<br />
	Hand-to-hand there a while we struggled;<br />
	billows welled blood; in the briny hall<br />
	her head I hewed with a hardy blade<br />
	from Grendel&#39;s mother, &mdash; and gained my life,<br />
	though not without danger. My doom was not yet.<br />
	Then the haven-of-heroes, Healfdene&#39;s son,<br />
	gave me in guerdon great gifts of price.</p>
<p>
	Footnotes<br />
	1. Beowulf gives his uncle the king not mere gossip of his journey, but a statesmanlike forecast of the outcome of certain policies at the Danish court. Talk of interpolation here is absurd. As both Beowulf and Hygelac know, &mdash; and the folk for whom the Beowulf was put together also knew, &mdash; Froda was king of the Heathobards (probably the Langobards, once near neigh- bors of Angle and Saxon tribes on the continent), and had fallen in fight with the Danes. Hrothgar will set aside this feud by giving his daughter as &quot;peace-weaver&quot; and wife to the young king Ingeld, son of the slain Froda. But Beowulf, on general principles and from his observation of the particular case, foretells trouble.</p>
<p>
	2. Play of shields, battle. A Danish warrior cuts down Froda in the fight, and takes his sword and armor, leaving them to a son. This son is selected to accompany his mistress, the young princess Freawaru, to her new home when she is Ingeld&#39;s queen. Heedlessly he wears the sword of Froda in hall. An old warrior points it out to Ingeld, and eggs him on to vengeance. At his instigation the Dane is killed; but the murderer, afraid of results, and knowing the land, escapes. So the old feud must break out again.</p>
<p>
	3. That is, their disastrous battle and the slaying of their king.</p>
<p>
	4. The sword.</p>
<p>
	5. Beowulf returns to his forecast. Things might well go somewhat as follows, he says; sketches a little tragic story; and with this prophecy by illustration returns to the tale of his adventure.</p>
<p>
	6. Not an actual glove, but a sort of bag.</p>
