                <p>
	Well, once upon a time there were a woman, and she baked five pies. And when they come out of the oven, they was that overbaked the crust were too hard to eat. So she says to her darter:</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Darter,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;put you them there pies on the shelf an&rsquo; leave &lsquo;em there a little, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll come agin&mdash;&rdquo; She meant, you know, the crust &lsquo;ud get soft.</p>
<p>
	But the gal, she says to herself, &ldquo;Well, if they&rsquo;ll come agin, I&rsquo;ll ate &lsquo;em now.&rdquo; And she set to work and ate &lsquo;em all, first and last.</p>
<p>
	Well, come supper time, the woman she said, &ldquo;Goo you and git one o&rsquo; them there pies; I daresay they&rsquo;ve come agin, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The gal, she went an&rsquo; she looked, and there warn&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but the dishes. So back she come and says she, &ldquo;Noo, they ain&rsquo;t come agin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Not none on &lsquo;em?&rdquo; says the mother.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Not none on &lsquo;em,&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, come agin, or not come agin,&rdquo; says the woman, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; one for supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t, if they ain&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; says the gal.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But I can,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;Goo you and bring the best of &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Best or worst,&rdquo; says the gal, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve ate &lsquo;em all, and you can&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; one till that&rsquo;s come agin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Well, the woman she were wholly bate, and she took her spinnin&rsquo; to the door to spin, and as she span she sang:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		&ldquo;My darter ha&rsquo; ate five, five pies to-day&mdash;<br />
		My darter ha&rsquo; ate five, five pies to-day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	The king, he were a comin&rsquo; down the street and he hard her sing, but what she sang he couldn&rsquo;t hare, so he stopped and said:</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What were that you was a singin of, woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The woman, she were ashamed to let him hare what her darter had been a-doin&rsquo;, so she sang, &lsquo;stids o&rsquo; that:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		&ldquo;My darter ha&rsquo; spun five, five skeins to-day&mdash;<br />
		My darter ha&rsquo; spun five, five skeins to-day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	&ldquo;S&rsquo;ars o&rsquo; mine!&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;I never heerd tell of any one as could do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Then he said: &ldquo;Look you here, I want a wife, and I&rsquo;ll marry your darter. But look you here,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;&rsquo;leven months out o&rsquo; the year she shall have all the vittles she likes to eat, and all the gownds she likes to git, and all the cumpny she likes to hev; but the last month o&rsquo; the year she&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; to spin five skeins iv&rsquo;ry day, an&rsquo; if she doon&rsquo;t, I shall kill her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; says the woman; for she thowt what a grand marriage that was. And as for them five skeins, when te come tew, there&rsquo;d be plenty o&rsquo; ways of gettin&rsquo; out of it, and likeliest, he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; forgot about it.</p>
<p>
	Well, so they were married. An&rsquo; for &lsquo;leven months the gal had all the vittles she liked to ate, and all the gownds she liked to git, and all the cumpny she liked to have.</p>
<p>
	But when the time was gettin&rsquo; oover, she began to think about them there skeins an&rsquo; to wonder if he had &lsquo;em in mind. But not one word did he say about &lsquo;em, an&rsquo; she whoolly thowt he&rsquo;d forgot &lsquo;em.</p>
<p>
	Howsivir, the last day o&rsquo; the last month, he takes her to a room she&rsquo;d niver set eyes on afore. There worn&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; in it but a spinnin&rsquo; wheel and a stool. An&rsquo; says he, &ldquo;Now, me dear, hare you&rsquo;ll be shut in to-morrow with some vittles and some flax, and if you hain&rsquo;t spun five skeins by the night, yar hid&rsquo;ll goo off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	An&rsquo; awa&rsquo; he went about his business.</p>
<p>
	Well, she were that frightened. She&rsquo;d allus been such a gatless gal, that she didn&rsquo;t se much as know how to spin, an&rsquo; what were she to dew to-morrer, with no one to come nigh her to help her? She sat down on a stool in the kitchen, and lork! How she did cry!</p>
<p>
	Howsivir, all on a sudden she hard a sort of a knockin&rsquo; low down on the door. She upped and oped it, an&rsquo; what should she see but a small little black thing with a long tail. That looked up at her right kewrious, an&rsquo; that said:</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What are yew a-cryin&rsquo; for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Wha&rsquo;s that to yew?&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Niver yew mind,&rdquo; that said, &ldquo;but tell me what you&rsquo;re a cryin&rsquo; for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;That oon&rsquo;t dew me noo good if I dew,&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yew doon&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; that said, an&rsquo; twirled that&rsquo;s tail round.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;that oon&rsquo;t dew no harm, if that doon&rsquo;t dew no good,&rdquo; and she upped and told about the pies an&rsquo; the skeins an&rsquo; everything.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;This is what I&rsquo;ll dew,&rdquo; says the little black thing: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come to yar winder iv&rsquo;ry mornin&rsquo; an&rsquo; take the flax an&rsquo; bring it spun at night&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your pay?&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>
	That looked out o&rsquo; the corners o&rsquo; that&rsquo;s eyes an&rsquo; that said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you three guesses every night to guess my name, an&rsquo; if you hain&rsquo;t guessed it afore the month&rsquo;s up, yew shall be mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Well, she thowt she&rsquo;d be sure to guess that&rsquo;s name afore the month was up. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;I agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; that says, an&rsquo; lork! how that twirled that&rsquo;s tail.</p>
<p>
	Well, the next day, har husband, he took her inter the room, an&rsquo; there was the flax an&rsquo; the day&rsquo;s vittles.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s the flax,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;an&rsquo; if that ain&rsquo;t spun up this night, off goo yar hid.&rdquo; An&rsquo; then he went out an&rsquo; locked the door.</p>
<p>
	He&rsquo;d hardly goon, when there was a knockin&rsquo; agin the winder.</p>
<p>
	She upped and she oped it, and there sure enough was the little oo&rsquo;d thing a settin&rsquo; on the ledge.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the flax?&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Here te be,&rdquo; says she. And she gonned it to him.</p>
<p>
	Well, come the evenin&rsquo;, a knockin&rsquo; come agin to the winder. She upped an&rsquo; she oped it, and there were the little oo&rsquo;d thing, with five skeins of flax on his arm.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Here te be,&rdquo; says he, an&rsquo; he gonned it to her.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Now, what&rsquo;s my name?&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What, is that Bill?&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Noo, that ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says he. An&rsquo; he twirled his tail.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Is that Ned?&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Noo, that ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says he. An&rsquo; he twirled his tail.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, is that Mark?&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Noo, that ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says he. An&rsquo; he twirled his tail harder, an&rsquo; awa&rsquo; he flew.</p>
<p>
	Well, when har husban&rsquo; he come in, there was the five skeins riddy for him.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I see I shorn&rsquo;t hev for to kill you to-night, me dare,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hev yar vittles and yar flax in the mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; says he, an&rsquo; away he goes.</p>
<p>
	Well, ivery day the flax an&rsquo; the vittles, they was browt, an&rsquo; ivery day that there little black impet used for to come mornin&rsquo;s and evenin&rsquo;s. An&rsquo; all the day the darter, she set a tryin&rsquo; fur to think of names to say to it when te come at night. But she niver hot on the right one. An&rsquo; as that got to-warts the ind o&rsquo; the month, the impet that began for to look soo maliceful, an&rsquo; that twirled that&rsquo;s tail faster an&rsquo; faster each time she gave a guess.</p>
<p>
	At last te came to the last day but one. The impet that come at night along o&rsquo; the five skeins, an&rsquo; that said:</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What, hain&rsquo;t yew got my name yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Is that Nicodemus?&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Noo, t&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; that says.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Is that Sammle?&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Noo, t&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; that says.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A-well, is that Methusalem?&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Noo, t&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t that norther,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>
	Then that looks at her with that&rsquo;s eyes like a cool o&rsquo; fire, an that says, &ldquo;Woman, there&rsquo;s only to-morrer night, an&rsquo; then yar&rsquo;ll be mine!&rdquo; An&rsquo; away te flew.</p>
<p>
	Well, she felt that horrud. Howsomediver, she hard the king a-comin&rsquo; along the passage. In he came, an&rsquo; when he see the five skeins, he says, says he:</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, me dare,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see but what yew&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; your skeins ready to-morrer night as well, an&rsquo; as I reckon I shorn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; to kill you, I&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; supper in here to-night.&rdquo; So they brought supper an&rsquo; another stool for him, and down the tew they sot.</p>
<p>
	Well, he hadn&rsquo;t eat but a mouthful or so, when he stops and begins to laugh.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A-why,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I was out a-huntin&rsquo; to-day, an&rsquo; I got away to a place in the wood I&rsquo;d never seen afore. An&rsquo; there was an old chalk pit. An&rsquo; I heerd a sort of a hummin&rsquo;, kind o&rsquo;. So I got off my hobby, an&rsquo; I went right quiet to the pit, an&rsquo; I looked down. Well, what should there be but the funniest little black thing yew iver set eyes on. An&rsquo; what was that a dewin&rsquo; on, but that had a little spinnin&rsquo; wheel, an&rsquo; that were a-spinnin&rsquo; wonnerful fast, an&rsquo; a-twirlin&rsquo; that&rsquo;s tail. An&rsquo; as that span, that sang:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		&ldquo;Nimmy, nimmy not,<br />
		My name&rsquo;s Tom Tit Tot.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Well, when the darter heerd this, she fared as if she could ha&rsquo; jumped outer her skin for joy, but she di&rsquo;n&rsquo;t say a word.</p>
<p>
	Next day, that there little thing looked soo maliceful when he come for the flax. An&rsquo; when night came, she heerd that a-knockin&rsquo; agin the winder panes. She oped the winder, an&rsquo; that come right in on the ledge. That were grinnin&rsquo; from are to are, an&rsquo; Oo! tha&rsquo;s tail were twirlin&rsquo; round so fast.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What&rsquo;s my name?&rdquo; that says, as that gonned her the skeins.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Is that Solomon?&rdquo; she says, pretendin&rsquo; to be a-feard.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Noo, tain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; that says, an&rsquo; that come fudder inter the room.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, is that Zebedee?&rdquo; says she agin.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Noo, tain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says the impet. An&rsquo; then that laughed an&rsquo; twirled that&rsquo;s tail till yew cou&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hardly see it.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Take time, woman,&rdquo; that says; &ldquo;next guess, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re mine.&rdquo; An&rsquo; that stretched out that&rsquo;s black hands at her.</p>
<p>
	Well, she backed a step or two, an&rsquo; she looked at it, and then she laughed out, an&rsquo; says she, a pointin&rsquo; of her finger at it:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		&ldquo;Nimmy, nimmy not,<br />
		Yar name&rsquo;s Tom Tit Tot.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Well, when that hard her, that shruck awful an&rsquo; awa&rsquo; that flew into the dark, an&rsquo; she niver saw it noo more.</p>
