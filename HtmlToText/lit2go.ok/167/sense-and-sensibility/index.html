	<em>Sense and Sensibility</em> is a novel of manners and societal expectations. The story concerns two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood (Elinor representing &ldquo;sense&rdquo; and Marianne &ldquo;sensibility&rdquo;). Along with their mother and younger sister Margaret, they are left impoverished after the death of their father. The family is forced to move to a country cottage, offered to them by a generous relative. Before the move, Elinor forms an attachment to Edward Ferrars, and after the move, Marianne forms one for John Willoughby. These attachments lead to problems both personally and socially, and they must learn important lessons about themselves before resolutions can occur.</p>
<p>
	The novel was published in 1811 and was the first of Austen&#39;s works to be published, although it was originally printed under the pseudonym &quot;A Lady.&quot;</p>    </p>

	Willoughby calls again the next morning, and the family are again convinced of his charms, as he comes to admire them, and Marianne in particular. An attraction is growing.      </dd>

      <dd>
        
	Mrs. Dashwood and the girls are busied with more engagements in the neighborhood than they could have expected. In all social engagements to which the Dashwoods are invited, Willoughby is invited as well; his attachment to Marianne continues to grow, but not everyone likes it.      </dd>

	The party is supposed to go on a picnic to the estate of Colonel Brandon&rsquo;s brother-in-law, but they end up not going at all because Colonel Brandon gets a distressing letter that morning, and is forced to leave to attend to related business. Marianne is growing increasingly more reckless, and is exposing herself imprudently to the possibility of great disappointment in her relationship with Willoughby.      </dd>

      </dt>
      <dd>
        
	Mrs. Jennings continues to ponder over what exactly drew Colonel Brandon away so suddenly. Willoughby is becoming an even more attentive guest at the cottage, spending a great deal more time there than Allenham with his aunt.      </dd>

      <dd>
        
	Mrs. Dashwood is happy to see that Edward has come, and welcomes him very warmly as their guest. Again, the theme of money is shown to be of importance to the Dashwood girls; they cannot sustain themselves on their very small fortunes, and this limits their choices.      </dd>

      <dd>
        
	Marianne and Elinor are again shown to be foils in their responses to misfortune in their love lives. This chapter shows a certain confrontation between the gossipy mirth of Mrs. Jennings and her daughter, and the propriety, and perhaps even unsociability, shown by Lady Middleton and Mr. Palmer.      </dd>

	Marianne has finally seen her errors of being selfish and unjust toward many; her repentance is sincere, and she also laments her impropriety with Willoughby.      </dd>

	Marianne&rsquo;s transformation seems complete at this point; her affections for Willoughby are put to rest, and even her mother, who was once fond of him, has decided to forgive and forget. It seems at this point that Elinor&rsquo;s hopes for happiness are destroyed, as she does not have a suitor as Marianne still does.      </dd>

	Two years have passed. Edward is welcomed back by his mother, although he does not regain his inheritance from Robert. Mrs. Ferrars and even John and Fanny come and visit them at Delaford. Mrs. Dashwood and her two remaining daughters spend most of their time at Delaford, both to be near Elinor, and out of the hope that Marianne might accept the Colonel.      </dd>
