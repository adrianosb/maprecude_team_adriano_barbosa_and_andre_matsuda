                <p>
	&ldquo;Sydney,&rdquo; said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his jackal; &ldquo;mix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before, and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver&rsquo;s papers before the setting in of the long vacation. The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and bring grist to the mill again.</p>
<p>
	Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much application. It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him through the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at intervals for the last six hours.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?&rdquo; said Stryver the portly, with his hands in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he lay on his back.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Now, look here! I am going to tell you something that will rather surprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as shrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;DO you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes. And not for money. What do you say now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel disposed to say much. Who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Do I know her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I am not going to guess, at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning, with my brains frying and sputtering in my head. if you want me to guess, you must ask me to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well then, I&rsquo;ll tell you, said Stryver, coming slowly into a sitting posture. &ldquo;Sydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you, because you are such an insensible dog.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; returned Sydney, busy concocting the punch, &ldquo;are such a sensitive and poetical spirit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, &ldquo;though I don&rsquo;t prefer any claim to being the soul of Romance (for I hope I know better), still I am a tenderer sort of fellow than YOU.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You are a luckier, if you mean that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that. I mean I am a man of more&mdash;more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Say gallantry, while you are about it,&rdquo; suggested Carton.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well! I&rsquo;ll say gallantry. My meaning is that I am a man,&rdquo; said Stryver, inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, &ldquo;who cares more to be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how to be agreeable, in a woman&rsquo;s society, than you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Sydney Carton.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No; but before I go on,&rdquo; said Stryver, shaking his head in his bullying way, I&rsquo;ll have this out with you. You&rsquo;ve been at Doctor Manette&rsquo;s house as much as I have, or more than I have. Why, I have been ashamed of your moroseness there! Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have been ashamed of you, Sydney!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to be ashamed of anything,&rdquo; returned Sydney; &ldquo;you ought to be much obliged to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You shall not get off in that way,&rdquo; rejoined Stryver, shouldering the rejoinder at him; &ldquo;no, Sydney, it&rsquo;s my duty to tell you&mdash;and I tell you to your face to do you good&mdash;that you are a devilish ill-conditioned fellow in that sort of society. You are a disagreeable fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo; said Stryver, squaring himself; &ldquo;I have less need to make myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances. Why do I do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I never saw you do it yet,&rdquo; muttered Carton.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I do it because it&rsquo;s politic; I do it on principle. And look at me! I get on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,&rdquo; answered Carton, with a careless air; &ldquo;I wish you would keep to that. As to me&mdash;will you never understand that I am incorrigible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He asked the question with some appearance of scorn.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You have no business to be incorrigible,&rdquo; was his friend&rsquo;s answer, delivered in no very soothing tone.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I have no business to be, at all, that I know of,&rdquo; said Sydney Carton. &ldquo;Who is the lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable, Sydney,&rdquo; said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious friendliness for the disclosure he was about to make, &ldquo;because I know you don&rsquo;t mean half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no importance. I make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to me in slighting terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Certainly; and in these chambers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend; drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll. The young lady is Miss Manette. If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been a little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not. You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when I think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man&rsquo;s opinion of a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music of mine, who had no ear for music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers, looking at his friend.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Now you know all about it, Syd,&rdquo; said Mr. Stryver. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about fortune: she is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind to please myself: on the whole, I think I can afford to please myself. She will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man, and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her, but she is worthy of good fortune. Are you astonished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, &ldquo;Why should I be astonished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You approve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, &ldquo;Why should I not approve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said his friend Stryver, &ldquo;you take it more easily than I fancied you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. Yes, Sydney, I have had enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it; I feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels inclined to go to it (when he doesn&rsquo;t, he can stay away), and I feel that Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me credit. So I have made up my mind. And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to say a word to YOU about YOUR prospects. You are in a bad way, you know; you really are in a bad way. You don&rsquo;t know the value of money, you Eve hard, you&rsquo;ll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor; you really ought to think about a nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look twice as big as he was, and four times as offensive.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Now, let me recommend you,&rdquo; pursued Stryver, &ldquo;to look it in the face. I have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the face, you, in your different way. Marry. Provide somebody to take care of you. Never mind your having no enjoyment of women&rsquo;s society, nor understanding of it, nor tact for it. Find out somebody. Find out some respectable woman with a little property&mdash;somebody in the landlady way, or lodging-letting way&mdash;and marry her, against a rainy day. That&rsquo;s the kind of thing for YOU. Now think of it, Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think of it,&rdquo; said Sydney.</p>
