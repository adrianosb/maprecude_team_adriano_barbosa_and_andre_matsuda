	SCENE. Venice. A public place</p>
<p>
	(Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK.)</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Three thousand ducats; well?</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Ay, sir, for three months.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	For three months; well?</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Antonio shall become bound; well?</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your<br />
	answer?</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Three thousand ducats, for three months, and Antonio bound.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Your answer to that.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Antonio is a good man.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Ho, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a good man<br />
	is to have you understand me that he is sufficient; yet his means<br />
	are in supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another<br />
	to the Indies; I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a<br />
	third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he<br />
	hath, squandered abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but<br />
	men; there be land-rats and water-rats, land-thieves and<br />
	water-thieves,&mdash;I mean pirates,&mdash;and then there is the peril of<br />
	waters, winds, and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,<br />
	sufficient. Three thousand ducats- I think I may take his bond.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Be assured you may.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured, I<br />
	will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	If it please you to dine with us.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which your<br />
	prophet, the Nazarite, conjured the devil into. I will buy with<br />
	you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so<br />
	following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray<br />
	with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?</p>
<p>
	(Enter ANTONIO)</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	This is Signior Antonio.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	(Aside) How like a fawning publican he looks!<br />
	I hate him for he is a Christian;<br />
	But more for that in low simplicity<br />
	He lends out money gratis, and brings down<br />
	The rate of usance here with us in Venice.<br />
	If I can catch him once upon the hip,<br />
	I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.<br />
	He hates our sacred nation; and he rails,<br />
	Even there where merchants most do congregate,<br />
	On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,<br />
	Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe<br />
	If I forgive him!</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Shylock, do you hear?</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	I am debating of my present store,<br />
	And, by the near guess of my memory,<br />
	I cannot instantly raise up the gross<br />
	Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?<br />
	Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,<br />
	Will furnish me. But soft! how many months<br />
	Do you desire? (To ANTONIO) Rest you fair, good signior;<br />
	Your worship was the last man in our mouths.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow<br />
	By taking nor by giving of excess,<br />
	Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,<br />
	I&#39;ll break a custom. (To BASSANIO) Is he yet possess&#39;d<br />
	How much ye would?</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	And for three months.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	I had forgot; three months; you told me so.<br />
	Well then, your bond; and, let me see. But hear you,<br />
	Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow<br />
	Upon advantage.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	I do never use it.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	When Jacob graz&#39;d his uncle Laban&#39;s sheep,&mdash;<br />
	This Jacob from our holy Abram was,<br />
	As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,<br />
	The third possessor; ay, he was the third,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	And what of him? Did he take interest?</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	No, not take interest; not, as you would say,<br />
	Directly interest; mark what Jacob did.<br />
	When Laban and himself were compromis&#39;d<br />
	That all the eanlings which were streak&#39;d and pied<br />
	Should fall as Jacob&#39;s hire, the ewes, being rank,<br />
	In end of autumn turned to the rams;<br />
	And when the work of generation was<br />
	Between these woolly breeders in the act,<br />
	The skilful shepherd peel&#39;d me certain wands,<br />
	And, in the doing of the deed of kind,<br />
	He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,<br />
	Who, then conceiving, did in eaning time<br />
	Fall parti-colour&#39;d lambs, and those were Jacob&#39;s.<br />
	This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;<br />
	And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv&#39;d for;<br />
	A thing not in his power to bring to pass,<br />
	But sway&#39;d and fashion&#39;d by the hand of heaven.<br />
	Was this inserted to make interest good?<br />
	Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.<br />
	But note me, signior.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Mark you this, Bassanio,<br />
	The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.<br />
	An evil soul producing holy witness<br />
	Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,<br />
	A goodly apple rotten at the heart.<br />
	O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Three thousand ducats; &#39;tis a good round sum.<br />
	Three months from twelve; then let me see the rate.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Signior Antonio, many a time and oft<br />
	In the Rialto you have rated me<br />
	About my moneys and my usances;<br />
	Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,<br />
	For suff&#39;rance is the badge of all our tribe;<br />
	You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,<br />
	And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine,<br />
	And all for use of that which is mine own.<br />
	Well then, it now appears you need my help;<br />
	Go to, then; you come to me, and you say<br />
	&#39;Shylock, we would have moneys.&#39; You say so:<br />
	You that did void your rheum upon my beard,<br />
	And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur<br />
	Over your threshold; moneys is your suit.<br />
	What should I say to you? Should I not say<br />
	&#39;Hath a dog money? Is it possible<br />
	A cur can lend three thousand ducats?&#39; Or<br />
	Shall I bend low and, in a bondman&#39;s key,<br />
	With bated breath and whisp&#39;ring humbleness,<br />
	Say this:&mdash;<br />
	&#39;Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;<br />
	You spurn&#39;d me such a day; another time<br />
	You call&#39;d me dog; and for these courtesies<br />
	I&#39;ll lend you thus much moneys?&#39;</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	I am as like to call thee so again,<br />
	To spet on thee again, to spurn thee too.<br />
	If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not<br />
	As to thy friends,&mdash;for when did friendship take<br />
	A breed for barren metal of his friend?&mdash;<br />
	But lend it rather to thine enemy;<br />
	Who if he break thou mayst with better face<br />
	Exact the penalty.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Why, look you, how you storm!<br />
	I would be friends with you, and have your love,<br />
	Forget the shames that you have stain&#39;d me with,<br />
	Supply your present wants, and take no doit<br />
	Of usance for my moneys, and you&#39;ll not hear me:<br />
	This is kind I offer.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	This were kindness.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	This kindness will I show.<br />
	Go with me to a notary, seal me there<br />
	Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,<br />
	If you repay me not on such a day,<br />
	In such a place, such sum or sums as are<br />
	Express&#39;d in the condition, let the forfeit<br />
	Be nominated for an equal pound<br />
	Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken<br />
	In what part of your body pleaseth me.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Content, in faith; I&#39;ll seal to such a bond,<br />
	And say there is much kindness in the Jew.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	You shall not seal to such a bond for me;<br />
	I&#39;ll rather dwell in my necessity.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it;<br />
	Within these two months, that&#39;s a month before<br />
	This bond expires, I do expect return<br />
	Of thrice three times the value of this bond.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	O father Abram, what these Christians are,<br />
	Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect<br />
	The thoughts of others. Pray you, tell me this;<br />
	If he should break his day, what should I gain<br />
	By the exaction of the forfeiture?<br />
	A pound of man&#39;s flesh, taken from a man,<br />
	Is not so estimable, profitable neither,<br />
	As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,<br />
	To buy his favour, I extend this friendship;<br />
	If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;<br />
	And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Then meet me forthwith at the notary&#39;s;<br />
	Give him direction for this merry bond,<br />
	And I will go and purse the ducats straight,<br />
	See to my house, left in the fearful guard<br />
	Of an unthrifty knave, and presently<br />
	I&#39;ll be with you.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Hie thee, gentle Jew.</p>
<p>
