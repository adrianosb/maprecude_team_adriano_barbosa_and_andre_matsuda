	SCENE. Venice. A court of justice</p>
<p>
	(Enter the DUKE: the Magnificoes; ANTONIO, BASSANIO, GRATIANO,<br />
	SALARINO, SALANIO, and Others.)</p>
<p>
	DUKE.<br />
	What, is Antonio here?</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Ready, so please your Grace.</p>
<p>
	DUKE.<br />
	I am sorry for thee; thou art come to answer<br />
	A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,<br />
	Uncapable of pity, void and empty<br />
	From any dram of mercy.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	I have heard<br />
	Your Grace hath ta&#39;en great pains to qualify<br />
	His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,<br />
	And that no lawful means can carry me<br />
	Out of his envy&#39;s reach, I do oppose<br />
	My patience to his fury, and am arm&#39;d<br />
	To suffer with a quietness of spirit<br />
	The very tyranny and rage of his.</p>
<p>
	DUKE.<br />
	Go one, and call the Jew into the court.</p>
<p>
	SALARINO.<br />
	He is ready at the door; he comes, my lord.</p>
<p>
	(Enter SHYLOCK.)</p>
<p>
	DUKE.<br />
	Make room, and let him stand before our face.<br />
	Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,<br />
	That thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice<br />
	To the last hour of act; and then, &#39;tis thought,<br />
	Thou&#39;lt show thy mercy and remorse, more strange<br />
	Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;<br />
	And where thou now exacts the penalty,&mdash;<br />
	Which is a pound of this poor merchant&#39;s flesh,&mdash;<br />
	Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,<br />
	But, touch&#39;d with human gentleness and love,<br />
	Forgive a moiety of the principal,<br />
	Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,<br />
	That have of late so huddled on his back,<br />
	Enow to press a royal merchant down,<br />
	And pluck commiseration of his state<br />
	From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,<br />
	From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train&#39;d<br />
	To offices of tender courtesy.<br />
	We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	I have possess&#39;d your Grace of what I purpose,<br />
	And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn<br />
	To have the due and forfeit of my bond.<br />
	If you deny it, let the danger light<br />
	Upon your charter and your city&#39;s freedom.<br />
	You&#39;ll ask me why I rather choose to have<br />
	A weight of carrion flesh than to receive<br />
	Three thousand ducats. I&#39;ll not answer that,<br />
	But say it is my humour: is it answer&#39;d?<br />
	What if my house be troubled with a rat,<br />
	And I be pleas&#39;d to give ten thousand ducats<br />
	To have it ban&#39;d? What, are you answer&#39;d yet?<br />
	Some men there are love not a gaping pig;<br />
	Some that are mad if they behold a cat;<br />
	And others, when the bagpipe sings i&#39; the nose,<br />
	Cannot contain their urine; for affection,<br />
	Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood<br />
	Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:<br />
	As there is no firm reason to be render&#39;d,<br />
	Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;<br />
	Why he, a harmless necessary cat;<br />
	Why he, a wauling bagpipe; but of force<br />
	Must yield to such inevitable shame<br />
	As to offend, himself being offended;<br />
	So can I give no reason, nor I will not,<br />
	More than a lodg&#39;d hate and a certain loathing<br />
	I bear Antonio, that I follow thus<br />
	A losing suit against him. Are you answered?</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,<br />
	To excuse the current of thy cruelty.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	I am not bound to please thee with my answer.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Do all men kill the things they do not love?</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Hates any man the thing he would not kill?</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Every offence is not a hate at first.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	What! wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	I pray you, think you question with the Jew:<br />
	You may as well go stand upon the beach,<br />
	And bid the main flood bate his usual height;<br />
	You may as well use question with the wolf,<br />
	Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;<br />
	You may as well forbid the mountain pines<br />
	To wag their high tops and to make no noise<br />
	When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;<br />
	You may as well do anything most hard<br />
	As seek to soften that&mdash;than which what&#39;s harder?&mdash;<br />
	His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,<br />
	Make no moe offers, use no farther means,<br />
	But with all brief and plain conveniency.<br />
	Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	For thy three thousand ducats here is six.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	If every ducat in six thousand ducats<br />
	Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,<br />
	I would not draw them; I would have my bond.</p>
<p>
	DUKE.<br />
	How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?<br />
	You have among you many a purchas&#39;d slave,<br />
	Which, fike your asses and your dogs and mules,<br />
	You use in abject and in slavish parts,<br />
	Because you bought them; shall I say to you<br />
	&#39;Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?<br />
	Why sweat they under burdens? let their beds<br />
	Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates<br />
	Be season&#39;d with such viands? You will answer<br />
	&#39;The slaves are ours.&#39; So do I answer you:<br />
	The pound of flesh which I demand of him<br />
	Is dearly bought; &#39;tis mine, and I will have it.<br />
	If you deny me, fie upon your law!<br />
	There is no force in the decrees of Venice.<br />
	I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?</p>
<p>
	DUKE.<br />
	Upon my power I may dismiss this court,<br />
	Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,<br />
	Whom I have sent for to determine this,<br />
	Come here to-day.</p>
<p>
	SALARINO.<br />
	My lord, here stays without<br />
	A messenger with letters from the doctor,<br />
	New come from Padua.</p>
<p>
	DUKE.<br />
	Bring us the letters; call the messenger.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!<br />
	The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all,<br />
	Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	I am a tainted wether of the flock,<br />
	Meetest for death; the weakest kind of fruit<br />
	Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me.<br />
	You cannot better be employ&#39;d, Bassanio,<br />
	Than to live still, and write mine epitaph.</p>
<p>
	(Enter NERISSA dressed like a lawyer&#39;s clerk.)</p>
<p>
	DUKE.<br />
	Came you from Padua, from Bellario?</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	From both, my lord. Bellario greets your Grace.</p>
<p>
	(Presents a letter.)</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,<br />
	Thou mak&#39;st thy knife keen; but no metal can,<br />
	No, not the hangman&#39;s axe, bear half the keenness<br />
	Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	O, be thou damn&#39;d, inexecrable dog!<br />
	And for thy life let justice be accus&#39;d.<br />
	Thou almost mak&#39;st me waver in my faith,<br />
	To hold opinion with Pythagoras<br />
	That souls of animals infuse themselves<br />
	Into the trunks of men. Thy currish spirit<br />
	Govern&#39;d a wolf who, hang&#39;d for human slaughter,<br />
	Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,<br />
	And, whilst thou lay&#39;st in thy unhallow&#39;d dam,<br />
	Infus&#39;d itself in thee; for thy desires<br />
	Are wolfish, bloody, starv&#39;d and ravenous.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,<br />
	Thou but offend&#39;st thy lungs to speak so loud;<br />
	Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall<br />
	To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.</p>
<p>
	DUKE.<br />
	This letter from Bellario doth commend<br />
	A young and learned doctor to our court.<br />
	Where is he?</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	He attendeth here hard by,<br />
	To know your answer, whether you&#39;ll admit him.</p>
<p>
	DUKE OF VENICE.<br />
	With all my heart: some three or four of you<br />
	Go give him courteous conduct to this place.<br />
	Meantime, the court shall hear Bellario&#39;s letter.</p>
<p>
	CLERK.<br />
	&#39;Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt<br />
	of your letter I am very sick; but in the instant that your<br />
	messenger came, in loving visitation was with me a young doctor<br />
	of Rome; his name is Balthazar. I acquainted him with the cause<br />
	in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant; we<br />
	turn&#39;d o&#39;er many books together; he is furnished with my opinion<br />
	which, bettered with his own learning,&mdash;the greatness whereof I<br />
	cannot enough commend,&mdash;comes with him at my importunity to fill<br />
	up your Grace&#39;s request in my stead. I beseech you let his lack<br />
	of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation,<br />
	for I never knew so young a body with so old a head. I leave him<br />
	to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his<br />
	commendation.&#39;</p>
<p>
	DUKE.<br />
	YOU hear the learn&#39;d Bellario, what he writes;<br />
	And here, I take it, is the doctor come.</p>
<p>
	(Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws.)</p>
<p>
	Give me your hand; come you from old Bellario?</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	I did, my lord.</p>
<p>
	DUKE.<br />
	You are welcome; take your place.<br />
	Are you acquainted with the difference<br />
	That holds this present question in the court?</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	I am informed throughly of the cause.<br />
	Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?</p>
<p>
	DUKE OF VENICE.<br />
	Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Is your name Shylock?</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Shylock is my name.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;<br />
	Yet in such rule that the Venetian law<br />
	Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.<br />
	(To ANTONIO.) You stand within his danger, do you not?</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Ay, so he says.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Do you confess the bond?</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	I do.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Then must the Jew be merciful.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	The quality of mercy is not strain&#39;d;<br />
	It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven<br />
	Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest:<br />
	It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.<br />
	&#39;Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes<br />
	The throned monarch better than his crown;<br />
	His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,<br />
	The attribute to awe and majesty,<br />
	Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;<br />
	But mercy is above this sceptred sway,<br />
	It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,<br />
	It is an attribute to God himself;<br />
	And earthly power doth then show likest God&#39;s<br />
	When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,<br />
	Though justice be thy plea, consider this,<br />
	That in the course of justice none of us<br />
	Should see salvation; we do pray for mercy,<br />
	And that same prayer doth teach us all to render<br />
	The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much<br />
	To mitigate the justice of thy plea,<br />
	Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice<br />
	Must needs give sentence &#39;gainst the merchant there.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,<br />
	The penalty and forfeit of my bond.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Is he not able to discharge the money?</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Yes; here I tender it for him in the court;<br />
	Yea, twice the sum; if that will not suffice,<br />
	I will be bound to pay it ten times o&#39;er<br />
	On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart;<br />
	If this will not suffice, it must appear<br />
	That malice bears down truth. And, I beseech you,<br />
	Wrest once the law to your authority;<br />
	To do a great right do a little wrong,<br />
	And curb this cruel devil of his will.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	It must not be; there is no power in Venice<br />
	Can alter a decree established;<br />
	&#39;Twill be recorded for a precedent,<br />
	And many an error by the same example<br />
	Will rush into the state. It cannot be.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!<br />
	O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	I pray you, let me look upon the bond.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Here &#39;tis, most reverend doctor; here it is.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Shylock, there&#39;s thrice thy money offer&#39;d thee.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	An oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven.<br />
	Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?<br />
	No, not for Venice.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Why, this bond is forfeit;<br />
	And lawfully by this the Jew may claim<br />
	A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off<br />
	Nearest the merchant&#39;s heart. Be merciful.<br />
	Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	When it is paid according to the tenour.<br />
	It doth appear you are a worthy judge;<br />
	You know the law; your exposition<br />
	Hath been most sound; I charge you by the law,<br />
	Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,<br />
	Proceed to judgment. By my soul I swear<br />
	There is no power in the tongue of man<br />
	To alter me. I stay here on my bond.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Most heartily I do beseech the court<br />
	To give the judgment.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Why then, thus it is:<br />
	You must prepare your bosom for his knife.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	O noble judge! O excellent young man!</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	For the intent and purpose of the law<br />
	Hath full relation to the penalty,<br />
	Which here appeareth due upon the bond.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	&#39;Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,<br />
	How much more elder art thou than thy looks!</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Therefore, lay bare your bosom.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Ay, &#39;his breast&#39;:<br />
	So says the bond:&mdash;doth it not, noble judge?&mdash;<br />
	&#39;Nearest his heart&#39;: those are the very words.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	It is so. Are there balance here to weigh<br />
	The flesh?</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	I have them ready.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,<br />
	To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Is it so nominated in the bond?</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	It is not so express&#39;d; but what of that?<br />
	&#39;Twere good you do so much for charity.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	I cannot find it; &#39;tis not in the bond.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	You, merchant, have you anything to say?</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	But little: I am arm&#39;d and well prepar&#39;d.<br />
	Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well.!<br />
	Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you,<br />
	For herein Fortune shows herself more kind<br />
	Than is her custom: it is still her use<br />
	To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,<br />
	To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow<br />
	An age of poverty; from which lingering penance<br />
	Of such misery doth she cut me off.<br />
	Commend me to your honourable wife:<br />
	Tell her the process of Antonio&#39;s end;<br />
	Say how I lov&#39;d you; speak me fair in death;<br />
	And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge<br />
	Whether Bassanio had not once a love.<br />
	Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,<br />
	And he repents not that he pays your debt;<br />
	For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,<br />
	I&#39;ll pay it instantly with all my heart.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Antonio, I am married to a wife<br />
	Which is as dear to me as life itself;<br />
	But life itself, my wife, and all the world,<br />
	Are not with me esteem&#39;d above thy life;<br />
	I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all<br />
	Here to this devil, to deliver you.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Your wife would give you little thanks for that,<br />
	If she were by to hear you make the offer.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	I have a wife whom, I protest, I love;<br />
	I would she were in heaven, so she could<br />
	Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	&#39;Tis well you offer it behind her back;<br />
	The wish would make else an unquiet house.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	These be the Christian husbands! I have a daughter;<br />
	Would any of the stock of Barabbas<br />
	Had been her husband, rather than a Christian!<br />
	We trifle time; I pray thee, pursue sentence.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	A pound of that same merchant&#39;s flesh is thine.<br />
	The court awards it and the law doth give it.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Most rightful judge!</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.<br />
	The law allows it and the court awards it.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Tarry a little; there is something else.<br />
	This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;<br />
	The words expressly are &#39;a pound of flesh&#39;:<br />
	Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;<br />
	But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed<br />
	One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods<br />
	Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate<br />
	Unto the state of Venice.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Is that the law?</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Thyself shalt see the act;<br />
	For, as thou urgest justice, be assur&#39;d<br />
	Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desir&#39;st.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	O learned judge! Mark, Jew: alearned judge!</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	I take this offer then: pay the bond thrice,<br />
	And let the Christian go.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Here is the money.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Soft!<br />
	The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:&mdash;<br />
	He shall have nothing but the penalty.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Therefore, prepare thee to cut off the flesh.<br />
	Shed thou no blood; nor cut thou less nor more,<br />
	But just a pound of flesh: if thou tak&#39;st more,<br />
	Or less, than a just pound, be it but so much<br />
	As makes it light or heavy in the substance,<br />
	Or the division of the twentieth part<br />
	Of one poor scruple; nay, if the scale do turn<br />
	But in the estimation of a hair,<br />
	Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!<br />
	Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Give me my principal, and let me go.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	I have it ready for thee; here it is.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	He hath refus&#39;d it in the open court;<br />
	He shall have merely justice, and his bond.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	A Daniel still say I; a second Daniel!<br />
	I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Shall I not have barely my principal?</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture<br />
	To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Why, then the devil give him good of it!<br />
	I&#39;ll stay no longer question.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Tarry, Jew.<br />
	The law hath yet another hold on you.<br />
	It is enacted in the laws of Venice,<br />
	If it be prov&#39;d against an alien<br />
	That by direct or indirect attempts<br />
	He seek the life of any citizen,<br />
	The party &#39;gainst the which he doth contrive<br />
	Shall seize one half his goods; the other half<br />
	Comes to the privy coffer of the state;<br />
	And the offender&#39;s life lies in the mercy<br />
	Of the duke only, &#39;gainst all other voice.<br />
	In which predicament, I say, thou stand&#39;st;<br />
	For it appears by manifest proceeding<br />
	That indirectly, and directly too,<br />
	Thou hast contrived against the very life<br />
	Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr&#39;d<br />
	The danger formerly by me rehears&#39;d.<br />
	Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the duke.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself;<br />
	And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,<br />
	Thou hast not left the value of a cord;<br />
	Therefore thou must be hang&#39;d at the state&#39;s charge.</p>
<p>
	DUKE.<br />
	That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,<br />
	I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.<br />
	For half thy wealth, it is Antonio&#39;s;<br />
	The other half comes to the general state,<br />
	Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that:<br />
	You take my house when you do take the prop<br />
	That doth sustain my house; you take my life<br />
	When you do take the means whereby I live.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	What mercy can you render him, Antonio?</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	A halter gratis; nothing else, for God&#39;s sake!</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	So please my lord the Duke and all the court<br />
	To quit the fine for one half of his goods;<br />
	I am content, so he will let me have<br />
	The other half in use, to render it<br />
	Upon his death unto the gentleman<br />
	That lately stole his daughter:<br />
	Two things provided more, that, for this favour,<br />
	He presently become a Christian;<br />
	The other, that he do record a gift,<br />
	Here in the court, of all he dies possess&#39;d<br />
	Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.</p>
<p>
	DUKE.<br />
	He shall do this, or else I do recant<br />
	The pardon that I late pronounced here.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	I am content.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Clerk, draw a deed of gift.</p>
<p>
	SHYLOCK.<br />
	I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;<br />
	I am not well; send the deed after me<br />
	And I will sign it.</p>
<p>
	DUKE.<br />
	Get thee gone, but do it.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers;<br />
	Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,<br />
	To bring thee to the gallows, not to the font.</p>
<p>
	(Exit SHYLOCK.)</p>
<p>
	DUKE.<br />
	Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon;<br />
	I must away this night toward Padua,<br />
	And it is meet I presently set forth.</p>
<p>
	DUKE.<br />
	I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.<br />
	Antonio, gratify this gentleman,<br />
	For in my mind you are much bound to him.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt DUKE, Magnificoes, and Train.)</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend<br />
	Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted<br />
	Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof<br />
	Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,<br />
	We freely cope your courteous pains withal.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	And stand indebted, over and above,<br />
	In love and service to you evermore.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	He is well paid that is well satisfied;<br />
	And I, delivering you, am satisfied,<br />
	And therein do account myself well paid:<br />
	My mind was never yet more mercenary.<br />
	I pray you, know me when we meet again:<br />
	I wish you well, and so I take my leave.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further;<br />
	Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,<br />
	Not as fee. Grant me two things, I pray you,<br />
	Not to deny me, and to pardon me.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	You press me far, and therefore I will yield.</p>
<p>
	(To ANTONIO)<br />
	Give me your gloves, I&#39;ll wear them for your sake.</p>
<p>
	(To BASSANIO)<br />
	And, for your love, I&#39;ll take this ring from you.<br />
	Do not draw back your hand; I&#39;ll take no more;<br />
	And you in love shall not deny me this.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	This ring, good sir? alas, it is a trifle;<br />
	I will not shame myself to give you this.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	I will have nothing else but only this;<br />
	And now, methinks, I have a mind to it.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	There&#39;s more depends on this than on the value.<br />
	The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,<br />
	And find it out by proclamation:<br />
	Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	I see, sir, you are liberal in offers;<br />
	You taught me first to beg, and now methinks<br />
	You teach me how a beggar should be answer&#39;d.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;<br />
	And, when she put it on, she made me vow<br />
	That I should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	That &#39;scuse serves many men to save their gifts.<br />
	And if your wife be not a mad-woman,<br />
	And know how well I have deserv&#39;d this ring,<br />
	She would not hold out enemy for ever<br />
	For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt PORTIA and NERISSA.)</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:<br />
	Let his deservings, and my love withal,<br />
	Be valued &#39;gainst your wife&#39;s commandment.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;<br />
	Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,<br />
	Unto Antonio&#39;s house. Away! make haste.</p>
<p>
	(Exit GRATIANO.)</p>
<p>
	Come, you and I will thither presently;<br />
	And in the morning early will we both<br />
	Fly toward Belmont. Come, Antonio.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt.)</p>
