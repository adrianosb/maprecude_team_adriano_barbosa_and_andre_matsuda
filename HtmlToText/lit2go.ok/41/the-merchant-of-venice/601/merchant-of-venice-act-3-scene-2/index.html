	SCENE. Belmont. A room in PORTIA&#39;s house.</p>
<p>
	(Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and Attendants.)</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	I pray you tarry; pause a day or two<br />
	Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,<br />
	I lose your company; therefore forbear a while.<br />
	There&#39;s something tells me, but it is not love,<br />
	I would not lose you; and you know yourself<br />
	Hate counsels not in such a quality.<br />
	But lest you should not understand me well,&mdash;<br />
	And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,&mdash;<br />
	I would detain you here some month or two<br />
	Before you venture for me. I could teach you<br />
	How to choose right, but then I am forsworn;<br />
	So will I never be; so may you miss me;<br />
	But if you do, you&#39;ll make me wish a sin,<br />
	That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,<br />
	They have o&#39;erlook&#39;d me and divided me:<br />
	One half of me is yours, the other half yours,<br />
	Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,<br />
	And so all yours. O! these naughty times<br />
	Puts bars between the owners and their rights;<br />
	And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,<br />
	Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.<br />
	I speak too long, but &#39;tis to peise the time,<br />
	To eke it, and to draw it out in length,<br />
	To stay you from election.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Let me choose;<br />
	For as I am, I live upon the rack.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Upon the rack, Bassanio! Then confess<br />
	What treason there is mingled with your love.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	None but that ugly treason of mistrust,<br />
	Which makes me fear th&#39; enjoying of my love:<br />
	There may as well be amity and life<br />
	&#39;Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,<br />
	Where men enforced do speak anything.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Promise me life, and I&#39;ll confess the truth.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Well then, confess and live.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	&#39;Confess&#39; and &#39;love&#39;<br />
	Had been the very sum of my confession:<br />
	O happy torment, when my torturer<br />
	Doth teach me answers for deliverance!<br />
	But let me to my fortune and the caskets.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Away, then! I am lock&#39;d in one of them:<br />
	If you do love me, you will find me out.<br />
	Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof;<br />
	Let music sound while he doth make his choice;<br />
	Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,<br />
	Fading in music: that the comparison<br />
	May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream<br />
	And watery death-bed for him. He may win;<br />
	And what is music then? Then music is<br />
	Even as the flourish when true subjects bow<br />
	To a new-crowned monarch; such it is<br />
	As are those dulcet sounds in break of day<br />
	That creep into the dreaming bridegroom&#39;s ear<br />
	And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,<br />
	With no less presence, but with much more love,<br />
	Than young Alcides when he did redeem<br />
	The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy<br />
	To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice;<br />
	The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,<br />
	With bleared visages come forth to view<br />
	The issue of th&#39; exploit. Go, Hercules!<br />
	Live thou, I live. With much much more dismay<br />
	I view the fight than thou that mak&#39;st the fray.</p>
<p>
	(A Song, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself.)</p>
<p>
	Tell me where is fancy bred,<br />
	Or in the heart or in the head,<br />
	How begot, how nourished?<br />
	Reply, reply.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	It is engend&#39;red in the eyes,<br />
	With gazing fed; and fancy dies<br />
	In the cradle where it lies.<br />
	Let us all ring fancy&#39;s knell:<br />
	I&#39;ll begin it.&mdash;Ding, dong, bell.</p>
<p>
	(ALL.) Ding, dong, bell.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	So may the outward shows be least themselves:<br />
	The world is still deceiv&#39;d with ornament.<br />
	In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt<br />
	But, being season&#39;d with a gracious voice,<br />
	Obscures the show of evil? In religion,<br />
	What damned error but some sober brow<br />
	Will bless it, and approve it with a text,<br />
	Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?<br />
	There is no vice so simple but assumes<br />
	Some mark of virtue on his outward parts.<br />
	How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false<br />
	As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins<br />
	The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;<br />
	Who, inward search&#39;d, have livers white as milk;<br />
	And these assume but valour&#39;s excrement<br />
	To render them redoubted! Look on beauty<br />
	And you shall see &#39;tis purchas&#39;d by the weight:<br />
	Which therein works a miracle in nature,<br />
	Making them lightest that wear most of it:<br />
	So are those crisped snaky golden locks<br />
	Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,<br />
	Upon supposed fairness, often known<br />
	To be the dowry of a second head,<br />
	The skull that bred them, in the sepulchre.<br />
	Thus ornament is but the guiled shore<br />
	To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf<br />
	Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,<br />
	The seeming truth which cunning times put on<br />
	To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,<br />
	Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;<br />
	Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge<br />
	&#39;Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,<br />
	Which rather threaten&#39;st than dost promise aught,<br />
	Thy plainness moves me more than eloquence,<br />
	And here choose I: joy be the consequence!</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	(Aside) How all the other passions fleet to air,<br />
	As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embrac&#39;d despair,<br />
	And shuddering fear, and green-ey&#39;d jealousy!<br />
	O love! be moderate; allay thy ecstasy;<br />
	In measure rain thy joy; scant this excess;<br />
	I feel too much thy blessing; make it less,<br />
	For fear I surfeit!</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	What find I here? (Opening the leaden casket.)<br />
	Fair Portia&#39;s counterfeit! What demi-god<br />
	Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?<br />
	Or whether riding on the balls of mine,<br />
	Seem they in motion? Here are sever&#39;d lips,<br />
	Parted with sugar breath; so sweet a bar<br />
	Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs<br />
	The painter plays the spider, and hath woven<br />
	A golden mesh t&#39; entrap the hearts of men<br />
	Faster than gnats in cobwebs: but her eyes!&mdash;<br />
	How could he see to do them? Having made one,<br />
	Methinks it should have power to steal both his,<br />
	And leave itself unfurnish&#39;d: yet look, how far<br />
	The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow<br />
	In underprizing it, so far this shadow<br />
	Doth limp behind the substance. Here&#39;s the scroll,<br />
	The continent and summary of my fortune.</p>
<p>
	&#39;You that choose not by the view,<br />
	Chance as fair and choose as true!<br />
	Since this fortune falls to you,<br />
	Be content and seek no new.<br />
	If you be well pleas&#39;d with this,<br />
	And hold your fortune for your bliss,<br />
	Turn to where your lady is<br />
	And claim her with a loving kiss.&#39;</p>
<p>
	A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave; {Kissing her.)<br />
	I come by note, to give and to receive.<br />
	Like one of two contending in a prize,<br />
	That thinks he hath done well in people&#39;s eyes,<br />
	Hearing applause and universal shout,<br />
	Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt<br />
	Whether those peals of praise be his or no;<br />
	So, thrice-fair lady, stand I, even so,<br />
	As doubtful whether what I see be true,<br />
	Until confirm&#39;d, sign&#39;d, ratified by you.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,<br />
	Such as I am: though for myself alone<br />
	I would not be ambitious in my wish<br />
	To wish myself much better, yet for you<br />
	I would be trebled twenty times myself,<br />
	A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times<br />
	More rich;<br />
	That only to stand high in your account,<br />
	I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends,<br />
	Exceed account. But the full sum of me<br />
	Is sum of something which, to term in gross,<br />
	Is an unlesson&#39;d girl, unschool&#39;d, unpractis&#39;d;<br />
	Happy in this, she is not yet so old<br />
	But she may learn; happier than this,<br />
	She is not bred so dull but she can learn;<br />
	Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit<br />
	Commits itself to yours to be directed,<br />
	As from her lord, her governor, her king.<br />
	Myself and what is mine to you and yours<br />
	Is now converted. But now I was the lord<br />
	Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,<br />
	Queen o&#39;er myself; and even now, but now,<br />
	This house, these servants, and this same myself,<br />
	Are yours- my lord&#39;s. I give them with this ring,<br />
	Which when you part from, lose, or give away,<br />
	Let it presage the ruin of your love,<br />
	And be my vantage to exclaim on you.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Madam, you have bereft me of all words,<br />
	Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;<br />
	And there is such confusion in my powers<br />
	As, after some oration fairly spoke<br />
	By a beloved prince, there doth appear<br />
	Among the buzzing pleased multitude;<br />
	Where every something, being blent together,<br />
	Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,<br />
	Express&#39;d and not express&#39;d. But when this ring<br />
	Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:<br />
	O! then be bold to say Bassanio&#39;s dead.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	My lord and lady, it is now our time,<br />
	That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,<br />
	To cry, good joy. Good joy, my lord and lady!</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,<br />
	I wish you all the joy that you can wish;<br />
	For I am sure you can wish none from me;<br />
	And when your honours mean to solemnize<br />
	The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you<br />
	Even at that time I may be married too.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	I thank your lordship, you have got me one.<br />
	My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:<br />
	You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;<br />
	You lov&#39;d, I lov&#39;d; for intermission<br />
	No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.<br />
	Your fortune stood upon the caskets there,<br />
	And so did mine too, as the matter falls;<br />
	For wooing here until I sweat again,<br />
	And swearing till my very roof was dry<br />
	With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,<br />
	I got a promise of this fair one here<br />
	To have her love, provided that your fortune<br />
	Achiev&#39;d her mistress.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Is this true, Nerissa?</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	Madam, it is, so you stand pleas&#39;d withal.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	Yes, faith, my lord.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Our feast shall be much honour&#39;d in your marriage.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	We&#39;ll play with them the first boy for a thousand<br />
	ducats.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	What! and stake down?</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	No; we shall ne&#39;er win at that sport, and stake down.<br />
	But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel?<br />
	What, and my old Venetian friend, Salanio!</p>
<p>
	(Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALANIO.)</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Lorenzo and Salanio, welcome hither,<br />
	If that the youth of my new interest here<br />
	Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,<br />
	I bid my very friends and countrymen,<br />
	Sweet Portia, welcome.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	So do I, my lord;<br />
	They are entirely welcome.</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,<br />
	My purpose was not to have seen you here;<br />
	But meeting with Salanio by the way,<br />
	He did entreat me, past all saying nay,<br />
	To come with him along.</p>
<p>
	SALANIO.<br />
	I did, my lord,<br />
	And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio<br />
	Commends him to you.</p>
<p>
	(Gives BASSANIO a letter)</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Ere I ope his letter,<br />
	I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.</p>
<p>
	SALANIO.<br />
	Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;<br />
	Nor well, unless in mind; his letter there<br />
	Will show you his estate.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.<br />
	Your hand, Salanio. What&#39;s the news from Venice?<br />
	How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?<br />
	I know he will be glad of our success:<br />
	We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.</p>
<p>
	SALANIO.<br />
	I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper.<br />
	That steal the colour from Bassanio&#39;s cheek:<br />
	Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world<br />
	Could turn so much the constitution<br />
	Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!<br />
	With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,<br />
	And I must freely have the half of anything<br />
	That this same paper brings you.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	O sweet Portia!<br />
	Here are a few of the unpleasant&#39;st words<br />
	That ever blotted paper. Gentle lady,<br />
	When I did first impart my love to you,<br />
	I freely told you all the wealth I had<br />
	Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;<br />
	And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,<br />
	Rating myself at nothing, you shall see<br />
	How much I was a braggart. When I told you<br />
	My state was nothing, I should then have told you<br />
	That I was worse than nothing; for indeed<br />
	I have engag&#39;d myself to a dear friend,<br />
	Engag&#39;d my friend to his mere enemy,<br />
	To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,<br />
	The paper as the body of my friend,<br />
	And every word in it a gaping wound<br />
	Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salanio?<br />
	Hath all his ventures fail&#39;d? What, not one hit?<br />
	From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,<br />
	From Lisbon, Barbary, and India?<br />
	And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch<br />
	Of merchant-marring rocks?</p>
<p>
	SALANIO.<br />
	Not one, my lord.<br />
	Besides, it should appear that, if he had<br />
	The present money to discharge the Jew,<br />
	He would not take it. Never did I know<br />
	A creature that did bear the shape of man,<br />
	So keen and greedy to confound a man.<br />
	He plies the duke at morning and at night,<br />
	And doth impeach the freedom of the state,<br />
	If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,<br />
	The duke himself, and the magnificoes<br />
	Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;<br />
	But none can drive him from the envious plea<br />
	Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.</p>
<p>
	JESSICA.<br />
	When I was with him, I have heard him swear<br />
	To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,<br />
	That he would rather have Antonio&#39;s flesh<br />
	Than twenty times the value of the sum<br />
	That he did owe him; and I know, my lord,<br />
	If law, authority, and power, deny not,<br />
	It will go hard with poor Antonio.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,<br />
	The best condition&#39;d and unwearied spirit<br />
	In doing courtesies; and one in whom<br />
	The ancient Roman honour more appears<br />
	Than any that draws breath in Italy.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	What sum owes he the Jew?</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	For me, three thousand ducats.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	What! no more?<br />
	Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;<br />
	Double six thousand, and then treble that,<br />
	Before a friend of this description<br />
	Shall lose a hair through Bassanio&#39;s fault.<br />
	First go with me to church and call me wife,<br />
	And then away to Venice to your friend;<br />
	For never shall you lie by Portia&#39;s side<br />
	With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold<br />
	To pay the petty debt twenty times over:<br />
	When it is paid, bring your true friend along.<br />
	My maid Nerissa and myself meantime,<br />
	Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!<br />
	For you shall hence upon your wedding day.<br />
	Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer;<br />
	Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.<br />
	But let me hear the letter of your friend.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	&#39;Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried,<br />
	my creditors grow cruel, my estate is very low, my bond to the<br />
	Jew is forfeit; and since, in paying it, it is impossible I<br />
	should live, all debts are clear&#39;d between you and I, if I might<br />
	but see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your pleasure; if<br />
	your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.&#39;</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	O love, dispatch all business and be gone!</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Since I have your good leave to go away,<br />
	I will make haste; but, till I come again,<br />
	No bed shall e&#39;er be guilty of my stay,<br />
	Nor rest be interposer &#39;twixt us twain.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt.)</p>
