	SCENE. Belmont. A room in PORTIA&#39;S house</p>
<p>
	(Enter PORTIA and NERISSA.)</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this<br />
	great world.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the<br />
	same abundance as your good fortunes are; and yet, for aught I<br />
	see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that<br />
	starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be<br />
	seated in the mean: superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but<br />
	competency lives longer.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Good sentences, and well pronounced.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	They would be better, if well followed.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do,<br />
	chapels had been churches, and poor men&#39;s cottages princes&#39;<br />
	palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions; I<br />
	can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one<br />
	of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may devise<br />
	laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o&#39;er a cold decree;<br />
	such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o&#39;er the meshes of good<br />
	counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to<br />
	choose me a husband. O me, the word &#39;choose&#39;! I may neither<br />
	choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike; so is the will of a<br />
	living daughter curb&#39;d by the will of a dead father. Is it not<br />
	hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death<br />
	have good inspirations; therefore the lott&#39;ry that he hath<br />
	devised in these three chests, of gold, silver, and lead, whereof<br />
	who chooses his meaning chooses you, will no doubt never be<br />
	chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. But<br />
	what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these<br />
	princely suitors that are already come?</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	I pray thee over-name them; and as thou namest them, I will<br />
	describe them; and according to my description, level at my<br />
	affection.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	First, there is the Neapolitan prince.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Ay, that&#39;s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of<br />
	his horse; and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good<br />
	parts that he can shoe him himself; I am much afeard my lady his<br />
	mother play&#39;d false with a smith.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	Then is there the County Palatine.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	He doth nothing but frown, as who should say &#39;An you will<br />
	not have me, choose.&#39; He hears merry tales and smiles not: I fear<br />
	he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so<br />
	full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be married<br />
	to a death&#39;s-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of<br />
	these. God defend me from these two!</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In<br />
	truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he! why, he hath a<br />
	horse better than the Neapolitan&#39;s, a better bad habit of<br />
	frowning than the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man. If a<br />
	throstle sing he falls straight a-capering; he will fence with<br />
	his own shadow; if I should marry him, I should marry twenty<br />
	husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him; for if he<br />
	love me to madness, I shall never requite him.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron of<br />
	England?</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me,<br />
	nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you<br />
	will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth<br />
	in the English. He is a proper man&#39;s picture; but alas, who can<br />
	converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I think he<br />
	bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet<br />
	in Germany, and his behaviour everywhere.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed<br />
	a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him<br />
	again when he was able; I think the Frenchman became his surety,<br />
	and sealed under for another.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony&#39;s nephew?</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Very vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most<br />
	vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk: when he is best, he is<br />
	a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little<br />
	better than a beast. An the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I<br />
	shall make shift to go without him.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket,<br />
	you should refuse to perform your father&#39;s will, if you should<br />
	refuse to accept him.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep<br />
	glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket; for if the devil be<br />
	within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I<br />
	will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords;<br />
	they have acquainted me with their determinations, which is<br />
	indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more<br />
	suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father&#39;s<br />
	imposition, depending on the caskets.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as<br />
	Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father&#39;s will. I<br />
	am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable; for there is not<br />
	one among them but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God<br />
	grant them a fair departure.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	Do you not remember, lady, in your father&#39;s time, a Venetian, a<br />
	scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis<br />
	of Montferrat?</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, so was he called.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes<br />
	looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.</p>
<p>
	(Enter a SERVANT.)</p>
<p>
	How now! what news?</p>
<p>
	SERVANT.<br />
	The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their<br />
	leave; and there is a forerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of<br />
	Morocco, who brings word the Prince his master will be here<br />
	to-night.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I<br />
	can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his<br />
	approach; if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion<br />
	of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.<br />
	Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.<br />
	Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the<br />
	door.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt)</p>
