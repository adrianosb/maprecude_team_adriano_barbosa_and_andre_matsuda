	SCENE. Belmont. The avenue to PORTIA&#39;s house.</p>
<p>
	(Enter LORENZO and JESSICA.)</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,<br />
	When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees,<br />
	And they did make no noise, in such a night,<br />
	Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls,<br />
	And sigh&#39;d his soul toward the Grecian tents,<br />
	Where Cressid lay that night.</p>
<p>
	JESSICA.<br />
	In such a night<br />
	Did Thisby fearfully o&#39;ertrip the dew,<br />
	And saw the lion&#39;s shadow ere himself,<br />
	And ran dismay&#39;d away.</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	In such a night<br />
	Stood Dido with a willow in her hand<br />
	Upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love<br />
	To come again to Carthage.</p>
<p>
	JESSICA.<br />
	In such a night<br />
	Medea gather&#39;d the enchanted herbs<br />
	That did renew old AEson.</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	In such a night<br />
	Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew,<br />
	And with an unthrift love did run from Venice<br />
	As far as Belmont.</p>
<p>
	JESSICA.<br />
	In such a night<br />
	Did young Lorenzo swear he lov&#39;d her well,<br />
	Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,&mdash;<br />
	And ne&#39;er a true one.</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	In such a night<br />
	Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,<br />
	Slander her love, and he forgave it her.</p>
<p>
	JESSICA.<br />
	I would out-night you, did no body come;<br />
	But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.</p>
<p>
	(Enter STEPHANO.)</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	Who comes so fast in silence of the night?</p>
<p>
	STEPHANO.<br />
	A friend.</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	A friend! What friend? Your name, I pray you, friend?</p>
<p>
	STEPHANO.<br />
	Stephano is my name, and I bring word<br />
	My mistress will before the break of day<br />
	Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about<br />
	By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays<br />
	For happy wedlock hours.</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	Who comes with her?</p>
<p>
	STEPHANO.<br />
	None but a holy hermit and her maid.<br />
	I pray you, is my master yet return&#39;d?</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	He is not, nor we have not heard from him.<br />
	But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,<br />
	And ceremoniously let us prepare<br />
	Some welcome for the mistress of the house.</p>
<p>
	(Enter LAUNCELOT.)</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT. Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	Who calls?</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo! Sola, sola!</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	Leave holloaing, man. Here!</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	Sola! Where? where?</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	Here!</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	Tell him there&#39;s a post come from my master with his<br />
	horn full of good news; my master will be here ere morning.</p>
<p>
	(Exit)</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	Sweet soul, let&#39;s in, and there expect their coming.<br />
	And yet no matter; why should we go in?<br />
	My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,<br />
	Within the house, your mistress is at hand;<br />
	And bring your music forth into the air.</p>
<p>
	(Exit STEPHANO.)</p>
<p>
	How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!<br />
	Here will we sit and let the sounds of music<br />
	Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night<br />
	Become the touches of sweet harmony.<br />
	Sit, Jessica: look how the floor of heaven<br />
	Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold;<br />
	There&#39;s not the smallest orb which thou behold&#39;st<br />
	But in his motion like an angel sings,<br />
	Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;<br />
	Such harmony is in immortal souls;<br />
	But, whilst this muddy vesture of decay<br />
	Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.</p>
<p>
	(Enter Musicians.)</p>
<p>
	Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn;<br />
	With sweetest touches pierce your mistress&#39; ear.<br />
	And draw her home with music.</p>
<p>
	(Music.)</p>
<p>
	JESSICA.<br />
	I am never merry when I hear sweet music.</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	The reason is, your spirits are attentive;<br />
	For do but note a wild and wanton herd,<br />
	Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,<br />
	Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,<br />
	Which is the hot condition of their blood;<br />
	If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,<br />
	Or any air of music touch their ears,<br />
	You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,<br />
	Their savage eyes turn&#39;d to a modest gaze<br />
	By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet<br />
	Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods;<br />
	Since nought so stockish, hard, and full of rage,<br />
	But music for the time doth change his nature.<br />
	The man that hath no music in himself,<br />
	Nor is not mov&#39;d with concord of sweet sounds,<br />
	Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;<br />
	The motions of his spirit are dull as night,<br />
	And his affections dark as Erebus.<br />
	Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.</p>
<p>
	(Enter PORTIA and NERISSA, at a distance.)</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	That light we see is burning in my hall.<br />
	How far that little candle throws his beams!<br />
	So shines a good deed in a naughty world.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	So doth the greater glory dim the less:<br />
	A substitute shines brightly as a king<br />
	Until a king be by, and then his state<br />
	Empties itself, as doth an inland brook<br />
	Into the main of waters. Music! hark!</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	It is your music, madam, of the house.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Nothing is good, I see, without respect:<br />
	Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark<br />
	When neither is attended; and I think<br />
	The nightingale, if she should sing by day,<br />
	When every goose is cackling, would be thought<br />
	No better a musician than the wren.<br />
	How many things by season season&#39;d are<br />
	To their right praise and true perfection!<br />
	Peace, ho! The moon sleeps with Endymion,<br />
	And would not be awak&#39;d!</p>
<p>
	(Music ceases.)</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	That is the voice,<br />
	Or I am much deceiv&#39;d, of Portia.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,<br />
	By the bad voice.</p>
<p>
	LORENZO. Dear lady, welcome home.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	We have been praying for our husbands&#39; welfare,<br />
	Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.<br />
	Are they return&#39;d?</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	Madam, they are not yet;<br />
	But there is come a messenger before,<br />
	To signify their coming.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Go in, Nerissa:<br />
	Give order to my servants that they take<br />
	No note at all of our being absent hence;<br />
	Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.</p>
<p>
	(A tucket sounds.)</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet.<br />
	We are no tell-tales, madam, fear you not.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	This night methinks is but the daylight sick;<br />
	It looks a little paler; &#39;tis a day<br />
	Such as the day is when the sun is hid.</p>
<p>
	(Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and their Followers.)</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	We should hold day with the Antipodes,<br />
	If you would walk in absence of the sun.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Let me give light, but let me not be light,<br />
	For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,<br />
	And never be Bassanio so for me:<br />
	But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	I thank you, madam; give welcome to my friend:<br />
	This is the man, this is Antonio,<br />
	To whom I am so infinitely bound.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	You should in all sense be much bound to him,<br />
	For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	No more than I am well acquitted of.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Sir, you are very welcome to our house.<br />
	It must appear in other ways than words,<br />
	Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO. (To NERISSA)<br />
	By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;<br />
	In faith, I gave it to the judge&#39;s clerk.<br />
	Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,<br />
	Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	A quarrel, ho, already! What&#39;s the matter?</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring<br />
	That she did give me, whose posy was<br />
	For all the world like cutlers&#39; poetry<br />
	Upon a knife, &#39;Love me, and leave me not.&#39;</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	What talk you of the posy, or the value?<br />
	You swore to me, when I did give it you,<br />
	That you would wear it till your hour of death,<br />
	And that it should lie with you in your grave;<br />
	Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,<br />
	You should have been respective and have kept it.<br />
	Gave it a judge&#39;s clerk! No, God&#39;s my judge,<br />
	The clerk will ne&#39;er wear hair on&#39;s face that had it.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	He will, an if he live to be a man.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	Ay, if a woman live to be a man.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,<br />
	A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy<br />
	No higher than thyself, the judge&#39;s clerk;<br />
	A prating boy that begg&#39;d it as a fee;<br />
	I could not for my heart deny it him.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	You were to blame,&mdash;I must be plain with you,&mdash;<br />
	To part so slightly with your wife&#39;s first gift,<br />
	A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger,<br />
	And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.<br />
	I gave my love a ring, and made him swear<br />
	Never to part with it, and here he stands,<br />
	I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it<br />
	Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth<br />
	That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,<br />
	You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief;<br />
	An &#39;twere to me, I should be mad at it.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.(Aside)<br />
	Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,<br />
	And swear I lost the ring defending it.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away<br />
	Unto the judge that begg&#39;d it, and indeed<br />
	Deserv&#39;d it too; and then the boy, his clerk,<br />
	That took some pains in writing, he begg&#39;d mine;<br />
	And neither man nor master would take aught<br />
	But the two rings.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	What ring gave you, my lord?<br />
	Not that, I hope, which you receiv&#39;d of me.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	If I could add a lie unto a fault,<br />
	I would deny it; but you see my finger<br />
	Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Even so void is your false heart of truth;<br />
	By heaven, I will ne&#39;er come in your bed<br />
	Until I see the ring.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	Nor I in yours<br />
	Till I again see mine.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Sweet Portia,<br />
	If you did know to whom I gave the ring,<br />
	If you did know for whom I gave the ring,<br />
	And would conceive for what I gave the ring,<br />
	And how unwillingly I left the ring,<br />
	When nought would be accepted but the ring,<br />
	You would abate the strength of your displeasure.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	If you had known the virtue of the ring,<br />
	Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,<br />
	Or your own honour to contain the ring,<br />
	You would not then have parted with the ring.<br />
	What man is there so much unreasonable,<br />
	If you had pleas&#39;d to have defended it<br />
	With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty<br />
	To urge the thing held as a ceremony?<br />
	Nerissa teaches me what to believe:<br />
	I&#39;ll die for&#39;t but some woman had the ring.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,<br />
	No woman had it, but a civil doctor,<br />
	Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me,<br />
	And begg&#39;d the ring; the which I did deny him,<br />
	And suffer&#39;d him to go displeas&#39;d away;<br />
	Even he that had held up the very life<br />
	Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?<br />
	I was enforc&#39;d to send it after him;<br />
	I was beset with shame and courtesy;<br />
	My honour would not let ingratitude<br />
	So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;<br />
	For, by these blessed candles of the night,<br />
	Had you been there, I think you would have begg&#39;d<br />
	The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Let not that doctor e&#39;er come near my house;<br />
	Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,<br />
	And that which you did swear to keep for me,<br />
	I will become as liberal as you;<br />
	I&#39;ll not deny him anything I have,<br />
	No, not my body, nor my husband&#39;s bed.<br />
	Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.<br />
	Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus;<br />
	If you do not, if I be left alone,<br />
	Now, by mine honour which is yet mine own,<br />
	I&#39;ll have that doctor for mine bedfellow.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	And I his clerk; therefore be well advis&#39;d<br />
	How you do leave me to mine own protection.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	Well, do you so: let not me take him then;<br />
	For, if I do, I&#39;ll mar the young clerk&#39;s pen.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;<br />
	And in the hearing of these many friends<br />
	I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,<br />
	Wherein I see myself,&mdash;</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Mark you but that!<br />
	In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,<br />
	In each eye one; swear by your double self,<br />
	And there&#39;s an oath of credit.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Nay, but hear me:<br />
	Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear<br />
	I never more will break an oath with thee.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	I once did lend my body for his wealth,<br />
	Which, but for him that had your husband&#39;s ring,<br />
	Had quite miscarried; I dare be bound again,<br />
	My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord<br />
	Will never more break faith advisedly.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,<br />
	And bid him keep it better than the other.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	By heaven! it is the same I gave the doctor!</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio,<br />
	For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,<br />
	For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor&#39;s clerk,<br />
	In lieu of this, last night did lie with me.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	Why, this is like the mending of high ways<br />
	In summer, where the ways are fair enough.<br />
	What! are we cuckolds ere we have deserv&#39;d it?</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	Speak not so grossly. You are all amaz&#39;d:<br />
	Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;<br />
	It comes from Padua, from Bellario:<br />
	There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,<br />
	Nerissa there, her clerk: Lorenzo here<br />
	Shall witness I set forth as soon as you,<br />
	And even but now return&#39;d; I have not yet<br />
	Enter&#39;d my house. Antonio, you are welcome;<br />
	And I have better news in store for you<br />
	Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;<br />
	There you shall find three of your argosies<br />
	Are richly come to harbour suddenly.<br />
	You shall not know by what strange accident<br />
	I chanced on this letter.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	I am dumb.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,<br />
	Unless he live until he be a man.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow:<br />
	When I am absent, then lie with my wife.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;<br />
	For here I read for certain that my ships<br />
	Are safely come to road.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	How now, Lorenzo!<br />
	My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.</p>
<p>
	NERISSA.<br />
	Ay, and I&#39;ll give them him without a fee.<br />
	There do I give to you and Jessica,<br />
	From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,<br />
	After his death, of all he dies possess&#39;d of.</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way<br />
	Of starved people.</p>
<p>
	PORTIA.<br />
	It is almost morning,<br />
	And yet I am sure you are not satisfied<br />
	Of these events at full. Let us go in;<br />
	And charge us there upon inter&#39;gatories,<br />
	And we will answer all things faithfully.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	Let it be so: he first inter&#39;gatory<br />
	That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,<br />
	Whe&#39;r till the next night she had rather stay,<br />
	Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:<br />
	But were the day come, I should wish it dark,<br />
	Till I were couching with the doctor&#39;s clerk.<br />
	Well, while I live, I&#39;ll fear no other thing<br />
	So sore as keeping safe Nerissa&#39;s ring.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt.)</p>
<p>
