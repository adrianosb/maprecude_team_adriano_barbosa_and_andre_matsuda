	SCENE. Venice. A street</p>
<p>
	(Enter LAUNCELOT GOBBO.)</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this<br />
	Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying<br />
	to me &#39;Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot&#39; or &#39;good Gobbo&#39; or<br />
	&#39;good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.&#39;<br />
	My conscience says &#39;No; take heed, honest Launcelot, take heed,<br />
	honest Gobbo&#39; or, as aforesaid, &#39;honest Launcelot Gobbo, do not<br />
	run; scorn running with thy heels.&#39; Well, the most courageous<br />
	fiend bids me pack. &#39;Via!&#39; says the fiend; &#39;away!&#39; says the<br />
	fiend. &#39;For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,&#39; says the fiend<br />
	&#39;and run.&#39; Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my<br />
	heart, says very wisely to me &#39;My honest friend Launcelot, being<br />
	an honest man&#39;s son&#39;&mdash;or rather &#39;an honest woman&#39;s son&#39;;&mdash;for<br />
	indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a<br />
	kind of taste;&mdash;well, my conscience says &#39;Launcelot, budge not.&#39;<br />
	&#39;Budge,&#39; says the fiend. &#39;Budge not,&#39; says my conscience.<br />
	&#39;Conscience,&#39; say I, (you counsel well.&#39; &#39;Fiend,&#39; say I, &#39;you<br />
	counsel well.&#39; To be ruled by my conscience, I should stay with<br />
	the Jew my master, who, God bless the mark! is a kind of devil;<br />
	and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend,<br />
	who, saving your reverence! is the devil himself. Certainly the<br />
	Jew is the very devil incarnal; and, in my conscience, my<br />
	conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel<br />
	me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly<br />
	counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment; I<br />
	will run.</p>
<p>
	(Enter OLD GOBBO, with a basket)</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	Master young man, you, I pray you; which is the way to Master<br />
	Jew&#39;s?</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	(Aside) O heavens! This is my true-begotten father, who, being<br />
	more<br />
	than sand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me not: I will try<br />
	confusions with him.</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to Master<br />
	Jew&#39;s?</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but, at<br />
	the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at the very next<br />
	turning, turn of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew&#39;s<br />
	house.</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	Be God&#39;s sonties, &#39;twill be a hard way to hit. Can you tell<br />
	me whether one Launcelot, that dwells with him, dwell with him or<br />
	no?</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	Talk you of young Master Launcelot? (Aside) Mark me<br />
	now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you of young Master<br />
	Launcelot?</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	No master, sir, but a poor man&#39;s son; his father, though I<br />
	say&#39;t, is an honest exceeding poor man, and, God be thanked, well<br />
	to live.</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	Well, let his father be what &#39;a will, we talk of young<br />
	Master Launcelot.</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	Your worship&#39;s friend, and Launcelot, sir.</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk<br />
	you of young Master Launcelot?</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	Of Launcelot, an&#39;t please your mastership.</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master Launcelot,<br />
	father; for the young gentleman,&mdash;according to Fates and<br />
	Destinies<br />
	and such odd sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of<br />
	learning,&mdash;is indeed deceased; or, as you would say in plain<br />
	terms, gone to heaven.</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my<br />
	very prop.</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a prop? Do<br />
	you know me, father?</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	Alack the day! I know you not, young gentleman; but I pray<br />
	you tell me, is my boy&mdash;God rest his soul!&mdash;alive or dead?</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	Do you not know me, father?</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the<br />
	knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his own child. Well,<br />
	old man, I will tell you news of your son. Give me your blessing;<br />
	truth will come to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man&#39;s son<br />
	may, but in the end truth will out.</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	Pray you, sir, stand up; I am sure you are not Launcelot, my boy.</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	Pray you, let&#39;s have no more fooling about it, but give<br />
	me your blessing; I am Launcelot, your boy that was, your son<br />
	that is, your child that shall be.</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	I cannot think you are my son.</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	I know not what I shall think of that; but I am Launcelot, the<br />
	Jew&#39;s man, and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother.</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	Her name is Margery, indeed: I&#39;ll be sworn, if thou be<br />
	Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood. Lord worshipped<br />
	might he be, what a beard hast thou got! Thou hast got more hair<br />
	on thy chin than Dobbin my thill-horse has on his tail.</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	It should seem, then, that Dobbin&#39;s tail grows backward;<br />
	I am sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face<br />
	when I last saw him.</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	Lord! how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy master<br />
	agree? I have brought him a present. How &#39;gree you now?</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	Well, well; but, for mine own part, as I have set up my<br />
	rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have run some ground.<br />
	My master&#39;s a very Jew. Give him a present! Give him a halter. I<br />
	am famished in his service; you may tell every finger I have with<br />
	my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come; give me your present to<br />
	one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries. If I<br />
	serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare<br />
	fortune! Here comes the man: to him, father; for I am a Jew, if I<br />
	serve the Jew any longer.</p>
<p>
	(Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO, with and other Followers.)</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper be<br />
	ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See these letters<br />
	delivered, put the liveries to making, and desire Gratiano to<br />
	come anon to my lodging.</p>
<p>
	(Exit a SERVANT)</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	To him, father.</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	God bless your worship!</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Gramercy; wouldst thou aught with me?</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	Here&#39;s my son, sir, a poor boy&mdash;</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew&#39;s man, that would,<br />
	sir,&mdash;as my father shall specify&mdash;</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve&mdash;</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and<br />
	have a desire, as my father shall specify&mdash;</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	His master and he, saving your worship&#39;s reverence, are<br />
	scarce cater-cousins&mdash;</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done<br />
	me wrong, doth cause me,&mdash;as my father, being I hope an old man,<br />
	shall frutify unto you&mdash;</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your<br />
	worship; and my suit is&mdash;</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as<br />
	your worship shall know by this honest old man; and, though I say<br />
	it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	One speak for both. What would you?</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	Serve you, sir.</p>
<p>
	GOBBO.<br />
	That is the very defect of the matter, sir.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	I know thee well; thou hast obtain&#39;d thy suit.<br />
	Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,<br />
	And hath preferr&#39;d thee, if it be preferment<br />
	To leave a rich Jew&#39;s service to become<br />
	The follower of so poor a gentleman.</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	The old proverb is very well parted between my master<br />
	Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of God, sir, and he hath<br />
	enough.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Thou speak&#39;st it well. Go, father, with thy son.<br />
	Take leave of thy old master, and inquire<br />
	My lodging out. (To a SERVANT) Give him a livery<br />
	More guarded than his fellows&#39;; see it done.</p>
<p>
	LAUNCELOT.<br />
	Father, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have ne&#39;er a<br />
	tongue in my head! (Looking on his palm) Well; if any man in<br />
	Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book,<br />
	I<br />
	shall have good fortune. Go to; here&#39;s a simple line of life:<br />
	here&#39;s a small trifle of wives; alas, fifteen wives is nothing;<br />
	a&#39;leven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one man.<br />
	And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life<br />
	with the edge of a feather-bed; here are simple &#39;scapes. Well, if<br />
	Fortune be a woman, she&#39;s a good wench for this gear. Father,<br />
	come; I&#39;ll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt LAUNCELOT and OLD GOBBO.)</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:<br />
	These things being bought and orderly bestow&#39;d,<br />
	Return in haste, for I do feast to-night<br />
	My best esteem&#39;d acquaintance; hie thee, go.</p>
<p>
	LEONARDO.<br />
	My best endeavours shall be done herein.</p>
<p>
	(Enter GRATIANO.)</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	Where&#39;s your master?</p>
<p>
	LEONARDO.<br />
	Yonder, sir, he walks.</p>
<p>
	(Exit.)</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	Signior Bassanio!&mdash;</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Gratiano!</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	I have suit to you.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	You have obtain&#39;d it.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Why, then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;<br />
	Thou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice;<br />
	Parts that become thee happily enough,<br />
	And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;<br />
	But where thou art not known, why there they show<br />
	Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain<br />
	To allay with some cold drops of modesty<br />
	Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behaviour<br />
	I be misconstrued in the place I go to,<br />
	And lose my hopes.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	Signior Bassanio, hear me:<br />
	If I do not put on a sober habit,<br />
	Talk with respect, and swear but now and then,<br />
	Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,<br />
	Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes<br />
	Thus with my hat, and sigh, and say &#39;amen&#39;;<br />
	Use all the observance of civility,<br />
	Like one well studied in a sad ostent<br />
	To please his grandam, never trust me more.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Well, we shall see your bearing.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	Nay, but I bar to-night; you shall not gauge me<br />
	By what we do to-night.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	No, that were pity;<br />
	I would entreat you rather to put on<br />
	Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends<br />
	That purpose merriment. But fare you well;<br />
	I have some business.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	And I must to Lorenzo and the rest;<br />
	But we will visit you at supper-time.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt.)</p>
