	SCENE. Venice. A street</p>
<p>
	(Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO)</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	In sooth, I know not why I am so sad;<br />
	It wearies me; you say it wearies you;<br />
	But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,<br />
	What stuff &#39;tis made of, whereof it is born,<br />
	I am to learn;<br />
	And such a want-wit sadness makes of me<br />
	That I have much ado to know myself.</p>
<p>
	SALARINO.<br />
	Your mind is tossing on the ocean;<br />
	There where your argosies, with portly sail&mdash;<br />
	Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,<br />
	Or as it were the pageants of the sea&mdash;<br />
	Do overpeer the petty traffickers,<br />
	That curtsy to them, do them reverence,<br />
	As they fly by them with their woven wings.</p>
<p>
	SALANIO.<br />
	Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,<br />
	The better part of my affections would<br />
	Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still<br />
	Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,<br />
	Peering in maps for ports, and piers, and roads;<br />
	And every object that might make me fear<br />
	Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt<br />
	Would make me sad.</p>
<p>
	SALARINO.<br />
	My wind, cooling my broth<br />
	Would blow me to an ague, when I thought<br />
	What harm a wind too great might do at sea.<br />
	I should not see the sandy hour-glass run<br />
	But I should think of shallows and of flats,<br />
	And see my wealthy Andrew dock&#39;d in sand,<br />
	Vailing her high top lower than her ribs<br />
	To kiss her burial. Should I go to church<br />
	And see the holy edifice of stone,<br />
	And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,<br />
	Which, touching but my gentle vessel&#39;s side,<br />
	Would scatter all her spices on the stream,<br />
	Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,<br />
	And, in a word, but even now worth this,<br />
	And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought<br />
	To think on this, and shall I lack the thought<br />
	That such a thing bechanc&#39;d would make me sad?<br />
	But tell not me; I know Antonio<br />
	Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Believe me, no; I thank my fortune for it,<br />
	My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,<br />
	Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate<br />
	Upon the fortune of this present year;<br />
	Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</p>
<p>
	SALARINO.<br />
	Why, then you are in love.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Fie, fie!</p>
<p>
	SALARINO.<br />
	Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad<br />
	Because you are not merry; and &#39;twere as easy<br />
	For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,<br />
	Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,<br />
	Nature hath fram&#39;d strange fellows in her time:<br />
	Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,<br />
	And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper;<br />
	And other of such vinegar aspect<br />
	That they&#39;ll not show their teeth in way of smile<br />
	Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.</p>
<p>
	(Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO.)</p>
<p>
	SALANIO.<br />
	Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,<br />
	Gratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare ye well;<br />
	We leave you now with better company.</p>
<p>
	SALARINO.<br />
	I would have stay&#39;d till I had made you merry,<br />
	If worthier friends had not prevented me.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Your worth is very dear in my regard.<br />
	I take it your own business calls on you,<br />
	And you embrace th&#39; occasion to depart.</p>
<p>
	SALARINO.<br />
	Good morrow, my good lords.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say when.<br />
	You grow exceeding strange; must it be so?</p>
<p>
	SALARINO.<br />
	We&#39;ll make our leisures to attend on yours.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt SALARINO and SALANIO.)</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,<br />
	We two will leave you; but at dinner-time,<br />
	I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	I will not fail you.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	You look not well, Signior Antonio;<br />
	You have too much respect upon the world;<br />
	They lose it that do buy it with much care.<br />
	Believe me, you are marvellously chang&#39;d.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;<br />
	A stage, where every man must play a part,<br />
	And mine a sad one.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	Let me play the fool;<br />
	With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come;<br />
	And let my liver rather heat with wine<br />
	Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.<br />
	Why should a man whose blood is warm within<br />
	Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster,<br />
	Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundice<br />
	By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio&mdash;<br />
	I love thee, and &#39;tis my love that speaks&mdash;<br />
	There are a sort of men whose visages<br />
	Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,<br />
	And do a wilful stillness entertain,<br />
	With purpose to be dress&#39;d in an opinion<br />
	Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit;<br />
	As who should say &#39;I am Sir Oracle,<br />
	And when I ope my lips let no dog bark.&#39;<br />
	O my Antonio, I do know of these<br />
	That therefore only are reputed wise<br />
	For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,<br />
	If they should speak, would almost damn those ears<br />
	Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.<br />
	I&#39;ll tell thee more of this another time.<br />
	But fish not with this melancholy bait,<br />
	For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.<br />
	Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile;<br />
	I&#39;ll end my exhortation after dinner.</p>
<p>
	LORENZO.<br />
	Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.<br />
	I must be one of these same dumb wise men,<br />
	For Gratiano never lets me speak.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	Well, keep me company but two years moe,<br />
	Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Fare you well; I&#39;ll grow a talker for this gear.</p>
<p>
	GRATIANO.<br />
	Thanks, i&#39; faith, for silence is only commendable<br />
	In a neat&#39;s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO.)</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Is that anything now?</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than<br />
	any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid<br />
	in, two bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find<br />
	them, and when you have them they are not worth the search.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Well; tell me now what lady is the same<br />
	To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,<br />
	That you to-day promis&#39;d to tell me of?</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	&#39;Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,<br />
	How much I have disabled mine estate<br />
	By something showing a more swelling port<br />
	Than my faint means would grant continuance;<br />
	Nor do I now make moan to be abridg&#39;d<br />
	From such a noble rate; but my chief care<br />
	Is to come fairly off from the great debts<br />
	Wherein my time, something too prodigal,<br />
	Hath left me gag&#39;d. To you, Antonio,<br />
	I owe the most, in money and in love;<br />
	And from your love I have a warranty<br />
	To unburden all my plots and purposes<br />
	How to get clear of all the debts I owe.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;<br />
	And if it stand, as you yourself still do,<br />
	Within the eye of honour, be assur&#39;d<br />
	My purse, my person, my extremest means,<br />
	Lie all unlock&#39;d to your occasions.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,<br />
	I shot his fellow of the self-same flight<br />
	The self-same way, with more advised watch,<br />
	To find the other forth; and by adventuring both<br />
	I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof,<br />
	Because what follows is pure innocence.<br />
	I owe you much; and, like a wilful youth,<br />
	That which I owe is lost; but if you please<br />
	To shoot another arrow that self way<br />
	Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,<br />
	As I will watch the aim, or to find both,<br />
	Or bring your latter hazard back again<br />
	And thankfully rest debtor for the first.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	You know me well, and herein spend but time<br />
	To wind about my love with circumstance;<br />
	And out of doubt you do me now more wrong<br />
	In making question of my uttermost<br />
	Than if you had made waste of all I have.<br />
	Then do but say to me what I should do<br />
	That in your knowledge may by me be done,<br />
	And I am prest unto it; therefore, speak.</p>
<p>
	BASSANIO.<br />
	In Belmont is a lady richly left,<br />
	And she is fair and, fairer than that word,<br />
	Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes<br />
	I did receive fair speechless messages:<br />
	Her name is Portia&mdash;nothing undervalu&#39;d<br />
	To Cato&#39;s daughter, Brutus&#39; Portia:<br />
	Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,<br />
	For the four winds blow in from every coast<br />
	Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks<br />
	Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;<br />
	Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos&#39; strond,<br />
	And many Jasons come in quest of her.<br />
	O my Antonio! had I but the means<br />
	To hold a rival place with one of them,<br />
	I have a mind presages me such thrift<br />
	That I should questionless be fortunate.</p>
<p>
	ANTONIO.<br />
	Thou know&#39;st that all my fortunes are at sea;<br />
	Neither have I money nor commodity<br />
	To raise a present sum; therefore go forth,<br />
	Try what my credit can in Venice do;<br />
	That shall be rack&#39;d, even to the uttermost,<br />
	To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.<br />
	Go presently inquire, and so will I,<br />
	Where money is; and I no question make<br />
	To have it of my trust or for my sake.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt)</p>
