	SCENE. A street.</p>
<p>
	(Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO)</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Where the devil should this Romeo be?<br />
	Came he not home to-night?</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Not to his father&#39;s; I spoke with his man.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.<br />
	Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,<br />
	Hath sent a letter to his father&#39;s house.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	A challenge, on my life.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Romeo will answer it.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Any man that can write may answer a letter.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Nay, he will answer the letter&#39;s master, how he<br />
	dares, being dared.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a<br />
	white wench&#39;s black eye; shot through the ear with a<br />
	love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the<br />
	blind bow-boy&#39;s butt-shaft: and is he a man to<br />
	encounter Tybalt?</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Why, what is Tybalt?</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is<br />
	the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as<br />
	you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and<br />
	proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and<br />
	the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk<br />
	button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the<br />
	very first house, of the first and second cause:<br />
	ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the<br />
	hai!</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	The what?</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting<br />
	fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! &#39;By Jesu,<br />
	a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good<br />
	whore!&#39; Why, is not this a lamentable thing,<br />
	grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with<br />
	these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these<br />
	perdona-mi&#39;s, who stand so much on the new form,<br />
	that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their<br />
	bones, their bones!</p>
<p>
	(Enter ROMEO)</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,<br />
	how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers<br />
	that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a<br />
	kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to<br />
	be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;<br />
	Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey<br />
	eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior<br />
	Romeo, bon jour! there&#39;s a French salutation<br />
	to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit<br />
	fairly last night.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in<br />
	such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	That&#39;s as much as to say, such a case as yours<br />
	constrains a man to bow in the hams.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Meaning, to court&#39;sy.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Thou hast most kindly hit it.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	A most courteous exposition.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Pink for flower.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Right.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Why, then is my pump well flowered.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast<br />
	worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it<br />
	is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	O single-soled jest, solely singular for the<br />
	singleness.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I&#39;ll cry a match.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have<br />
	done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of<br />
	thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:<br />
	was I with you there for the goose?</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast<br />
	not there for the goose.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Nay, good goose, bite not.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most<br />
	sharp sauce.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	O here&#39;s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an<br />
	inch narrow to an ell broad!</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	I stretch it out for that word &#39;broad;&#39; which added<br />
	to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?<br />
	now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art<br />
	thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:<br />
	for this drivelling love is like a great natural,<br />
	that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Stop there, stop there.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:<br />
	for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and<br />
	meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Here&#39;s goodly gear!</p>
<p>
	(Enter Nurse and PETER)</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	A sail, a sail!</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Two, two; a shirt and a smock.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	Peter!</p>
<p>
	PETER<br />
	Anon!</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	My fan, Peter.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan&#39;s the<br />
	fairer face.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	God ye good morrow, gentlemen.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	Is it good den?</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	&#39;Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the<br />
	dial is now upon the prick of noon.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	Out upon you! what a man are you!</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to<br />
	mar.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	By my troth, it is well said; &#39;for himself to mar,&#39;<br />
	quoth a&#39;? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I<br />
	may find the young Romeo?</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when<br />
	you have found him than he was when you sought him:<br />
	I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	You say well.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i&#39; faith;<br />
	wisely, wisely.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with<br />
	you.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	She will indite him to some supper.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	What hast thou found?</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,<br />
	that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.</p>
<p>
	(Sings)</p>
<p>
	An old hare hoar,<br />
	And an old hare hoar,<br />
	Is very good meat in lent<br />
	But a hare that is hoar<br />
	Is too much for a score,<br />
	When it hoars ere it be spent.<br />
	Romeo, will you come to your father&#39;s? we&#39;ll<br />
	to dinner, thither.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	I will follow you.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,</p>
<p>
	(Singing)</p>
<p>
	&#39;lady, lady, lady.&#39;</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO)</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy<br />
	merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,<br />
	and will speak more in a minute than he will stand<br />
	to in a month.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	An a&#39; speak any thing against me, I&#39;ll take him<br />
	down, an a&#39; were lustier than he is, and twenty such<br />
	Jacks; and if I cannot, I&#39;ll find those that shall.<br />
	Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am<br />
	none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by<br />
	too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?</p>
<p>
	PETER<br />
	I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon<br />
	should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare<br />
	draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a<br />
	good quarrel, and the law on my side.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about<br />
	me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:<br />
	and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you<br />
	out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:<br />
	but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into<br />
	a fool&#39;s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross<br />
	kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman<br />
	is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double<br />
	with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered<br />
	to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I<br />
	protest unto thee&mdash;</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	Good heart, and, i&#39; faith, I will tell her as much:<br />
	Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as<br />
	I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Bid her devise<br />
	Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;<br />
	And there she shall at Friar Laurence&#39; cell<br />
	Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	No truly sir; not a penny.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Go to; I say you shall.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:<br />
	Within this hour my man shall be with thee<br />
	And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;<br />
	Which to the high top-gallant of my joy<br />
	Must be my convoy in the secret night.<br />
	Farewell; be trusty, and I&#39;ll quit thy pains:<br />
	Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	What say&#39;st thou, my dear nurse?</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	Is your man secret? Did you ne&#39;er hear say,<br />
	Two may keep counsel, putting one away?</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	I warrant thee, my man&#39;s as true as steel.</p>
<p>
	NURSE<br />
	Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady&mdash;Lord,<br />
	Lord! when &#39;twas a little prating thing:&mdash;O, there<br />
	is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain<br />
	lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief<br />
	see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her<br />
	sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer<br />
	man; but, I&#39;ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks<br />
	as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not<br />
	rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	Ah. mocker! that&#39;s the dog&#39;s name; R is for<br />
	the&mdash;No; I know it begins with some other<br />
	letter:&mdash;and she hath the prettiest sententious of<br />
	it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good<br />
	to hear it.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Commend me to thy lady.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	Ay, a thousand times.</p>
<p>
	(Exit Romeo)</p>
<p>
	Peter!</p>
<p>
	PETER<br />
	Anon!</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt)</p>
