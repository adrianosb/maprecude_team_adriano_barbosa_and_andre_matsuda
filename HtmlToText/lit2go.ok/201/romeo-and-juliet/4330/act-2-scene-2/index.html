	SCENE. Capulet&#39;s orchard.</p>
<p>
	(Enter ROMEO)</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	He jests at scars that never felt a wound.</p>
<p>
	(JULIET appears above at a window)</p>
<p>
	But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?<br />
	It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.<br />
	Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,<br />
	Who is already sick and pale with grief,<br />
	That thou her maid art far more fair than she:<br />
	Be not her maid, since she is envious;<br />
	Her vestal livery is but sick and green<br />
	And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.<br />
	It is my lady, O, it is my love!<br />
	O, that she knew she were!<br />
	She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?<br />
	Her eye discourses; I will answer it.<br />
	I am too bold, &#39;tis not to me she speaks:<br />
	Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,<br />
	Having some business, do entreat her eyes<br />
	To twinkle in their spheres till they return.<br />
	What if her eyes were there, they in her head?<br />
	The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,<br />
	As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven<br />
	Would through the airy region stream so bright<br />
	That birds would sing and think it were not night.<br />
	See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!<br />
	O, that I were a glove upon that hand,<br />
	That I might touch that cheek!</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Ay me!</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	She speaks:<br />
	O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art<br />
	As glorious to this night, being o&#39;er my head<br />
	As is a winged messenger of heaven<br />
	Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes<br />
	Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him<br />
	When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds<br />
	And sails upon the bosom of the air.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?<br />
	Deny thy father and refuse thy name;<br />
	Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,<br />
	And I&#39;ll no longer be a Capulet.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	&#39;Tis but thy name that is my enemy;<br />
	Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.<br />
	What&#39;s Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,<br />
	Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part<br />
	Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!<br />
	What&#39;s in a name? that which we call a rose<br />
	By any other name would smell as sweet;<br />
	So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call&#39;d,<br />
	Retain that dear perfection which he owes<br />
	Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,<br />
	And for that name which is no part of thee<br />
	Take all myself.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	I take thee at thy word:<br />
	Call me but love, and I&#39;ll be new baptized;<br />
	Henceforth I never will be Romeo.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	What man art thou that thus bescreen&#39;d in night<br />
	So stumblest on my counsel?</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	By a name<br />
	I know not how to tell thee who I am:<br />
	My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,<br />
	Because it is an enemy to thee;<br />
	Had I it written, I would tear the word.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words<br />
	Of that tongue&#39;s utterance, yet I know the sound:<br />
	Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?<br />
	The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,<br />
	And the place death, considering who thou art,<br />
	If any of my kinsmen find thee here.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	With love&#39;s light wings did I o&#39;er-perch these walls;<br />
	For stony limits cannot hold love out,<br />
	And what love can do that dares love attempt;<br />
	Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	If they do see thee, they will murder thee.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye<br />
	Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,<br />
	And I am proof against their enmity.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	I would not for the world they saw thee here.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	I have night&#39;s cloak to hide me from their sight;<br />
	And but thou love me, let them find me here:<br />
	My life were better ended by their hate,<br />
	Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	By whose direction found&#39;st thou out this place?</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;<br />
	He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.<br />
	I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far<br />
	As that vast shore wash&#39;d with the farthest sea,<br />
	I would adventure for such merchandise.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Thou know&#39;st the mask of night is on my face,<br />
	Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek<br />
	For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night<br />
	Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny<br />
	What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!<br />
	Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say &#39;Ay,&#39;<br />
	And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear&#39;st,<br />
	Thou mayst prove false; at lovers&#39; perjuries<br />
	Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,<br />
	If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:<br />
	Or if thou think&#39;st I am too quickly won,<br />
	I&#39;ll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,<br />
	So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.<br />
	In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,<br />
	And therefore thou mayst think my &#39;havior light:<br />
	But trust me, gentleman, I&#39;ll prove more true<br />
	Than those that have more cunning to be strange.<br />
	I should have been more strange, I must confess,<br />
	But that thou overheard&#39;st, ere I was ware,<br />
	My true love&#39;s passion: therefore pardon me,<br />
	And not impute this yielding to light love,<br />
	Which the dark night hath so discovered.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear<br />
	That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops&mdash;</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,<br />
	That monthly changes in her circled orb,<br />
	Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	What shall I swear by?</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Do not swear at all;<br />
	Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,<br />
	Which is the god of my idolatry,<br />
	And I&#39;ll believe thee.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	If my heart&#39;s dear love&mdash;</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,<br />
	I have no joy of this contract to-night:<br />
	It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;<br />
	Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be<br />
	Ere one can say &#39;It lightens.&#39; Sweet, good night!<br />
	This bud of love, by summer&#39;s ripening breath,<br />
	May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.<br />
	Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest<br />
	Come to thy heart as that within my breast!</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	The exchange of thy love&#39;s faithful vow for mine.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:<br />
	And yet I would it were to give again.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	But to be frank, and give it thee again.<br />
	And yet I wish but for the thing I have:<br />
	My bounty is as boundless as the sea,<br />
	My love as deep; the more I give to thee,<br />
	The more I have, for both are infinite.</p>
<p>
	(Nurse calls within)</p>
<p>
	I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!<br />
	Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.<br />
	Stay but a little, I will come again.</p>
<p>
	(Exit, above)</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.<br />
	Being in night, all this is but a dream,<br />
	Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.</p>
<p>
	(Re-enter JULIET, above)</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.<br />
	If that thy bent of love be honourable,<br />
	Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,<br />
	By one that I&#39;ll procure to come to thee,<br />
	Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;<br />
	And all my fortunes at thy foot I&#39;ll lay<br />
	And follow thee my lord throughout the world.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	[Within] Madam!</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	I come, anon.&mdash;But if thou mean&#39;st not well,<br />
	I do beseech thee&mdash;</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	[Within] Madam!</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	By and by, I come:&mdash;<br />
	To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:<br />
	To-morrow will I send.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	So thrive my soul&mdash;</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	A thousand times good night!</p>
<p>
	(Exit, above)</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.<br />
	Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from<br />
	their books,<br />
	But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.</p>
<p>
	(Retiring)</p>
<p>
	(Re-enter JULIET, above)</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer&#39;s voice,<br />
	To lure this tassel-gentle back again!<br />
	Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;<br />
	Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,<br />
	And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,<br />
	With repetition of my Romeo&#39;s name.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	It is my soul that calls upon my name:<br />
	How silver-sweet sound lovers&#39; tongues by night,<br />
	Like softest music to attending ears!</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Romeo!</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	My dear?</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	At what o&#39;clock to-morrow<br />
	Shall I send to thee?</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	At the hour of nine.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	I will not fail: &#39;tis twenty years till then.<br />
	I have forgot why I did call thee back.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Let me stand here till thou remember it.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,<br />
	Remembering how I love thy company.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	And I&#39;ll still stay, to have thee still forget,<br />
	Forgetting any other home but this.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	&#39;Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:<br />
	And yet no further than a wanton&#39;s bird;<br />
	Who lets it hop a little from her hand,<br />
	Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,<br />
	And with a silk thread plucks it back again,<br />
	So loving-jealous of his liberty.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	I would I were thy bird.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Sweet, so would I:<br />
	Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.<br />
	Good night, good night! parting is such<br />
	sweet sorrow,<br />
	That I shall say good night till it be morrow.</p>
<p>
	(Exit above)</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!<br />
	Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!<br />
	Hence will I to my ghostly father&#39;s cell,<br />
	His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.</p>
<p>
	(Exit)</p>
