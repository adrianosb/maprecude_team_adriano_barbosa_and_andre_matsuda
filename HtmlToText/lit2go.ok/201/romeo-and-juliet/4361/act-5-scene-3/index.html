	SCENE. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.</p>
<p>
	(Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch)</p>
<p>
	PARIS<br />
	Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:<br />
	Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.<br />
	Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,<br />
	Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;<br />
	So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,<br />
	Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,<br />
	But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,<br />
	As signal that thou hear&#39;st something approach.<br />
	Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.</p>
<p>
	PAGE<br />
	[Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone<br />
	Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.</p>
<p>
	(Retires)</p>
<p>
	PARIS<br />
	Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--<br />
	O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--<br />
	Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,<br />
	Or, wanting that, with tears distill&#39;d by moans:<br />
	The obsequies that I for thee will keep<br />
	Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.</p>
<p>
	(The Page whistles)</p>
<p>
	The boy gives warning something doth approach.<br />
	What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,<br />
	To cross my obsequies and true love&#39;s rite?<br />
	What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.</p>
<p>
	(Retires)</p>
<p>
	(Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, &amp; c)</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.<br />
	Hold, take this letter; early in the morning<br />
	See thou deliver it to my lord and father.<br />
	Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,<br />
	Whate&#39;er thou hear&#39;st or seest, stand all aloof,<br />
	And do not interrupt me in my course.<br />
	Why I descend into this bed of death,<br />
	Is partly to behold my lady&#39;s face;<br />
	But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger<br />
	A precious ring, a ring that I must use<br />
	In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:<br />
	But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry<br />
	In what I further shall intend to do,<br />
	By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint<br />
	And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:<br />
	The time and my intents are savage-wild,<br />
	More fierce and more inexorable far<br />
	Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.</p>
<p>
	BALTHASAR<br />
	I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:<br />
	Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.</p>
<p>
	BALTHASAR<br />
	[Aside] For all this same, I&#39;ll hide me hereabout:<br />
	His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.</p>
<p>
	(Retires)</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,<br />
	Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,<br />
	Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,<br />
	And, in despite, I&#39;ll cram thee with more food!</p>
<p>
	(Opens the tomb)</p>
<p>
	PARIS<br />
	This is that banish&#39;d haughty Montague,<br />
	That murder&#39;d my love&#39;s cousin, with which grief,<br />
	It is supposed, the fair creature died;<br />
	And here is come to do some villanous shame<br />
	To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.</p>
<p>
	(Comes forward)</p>
<p>
	Stop thy unhallow&#39;d toil, vile Montague!<br />
	Can vengeance be pursued further than death?<br />
	Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:<br />
	Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.<br />
	Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;<br />
	Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;<br />
	Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,<br />
	Put not another sin upon my head,<br />
	By urging me to fury: O, be gone!<br />
	By heaven, I love thee better than myself;<br />
	For I come hither arm&#39;d against myself:<br />
	Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,<br />
	A madman&#39;s mercy bade thee run away.</p>
<p>
	PARIS<br />
	I do defy thy conjurations,<br />
	And apprehend thee for a felon here.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!</p>
<p>
	(They fight)</p>
<p>
	PAGE<br />
	O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.</p>
<p>
	(Exit)</p>
<p>
	PARIS<br />
	O, I am slain!</p>
<p>
	(Falls)</p>
<p>
	If thou be merciful,<br />
	Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.</p>
<p>
	(Dies)</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.<br />
	Mercutio&#39;s kinsman, noble County Paris!<br />
	What said my man, when my betossed soul<br />
	Did not attend him as we rode? I think<br />
	He told me Paris should have married Juliet:<br />
	Said he not so? or did I dream it so?<br />
	Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,<br />
	To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,<br />
	One writ with me in sour misfortune&#39;s book!<br />
	I&#39;ll bury thee in a triumphant grave;<br />
	A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter&#39;d youth,<br />
	For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes<br />
	This vault a feasting presence full of light.<br />
	Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr&#39;d.</p>
<p>
	Laying PARIS in the tomb</p>
<p>
	How oft when men are at the point of death<br />
	Have they been merry! which their keepers call<br />
	A lightning before death: O, how may I<br />
	Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!<br />
	Death, that hath suck&#39;d the honey of thy breath,<br />
	Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:<br />
	Thou art not conquer&#39;d; beauty&#39;s ensign yet<br />
	Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,<br />
	And death&#39;s pale flag is not advanced there.<br />
	Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?<br />
	O, what more favour can I do to thee,<br />
	Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain<br />
	To sunder his that was thine enemy?<br />
	Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,<br />
	Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe<br />
	That unsubstantial death is amorous,<br />
	And that the lean abhorred monster keeps<br />
	Thee here in dark to be his paramour?<br />
	For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;<br />
	And never from this palace of dim night<br />
	Depart again: here, here will I remain<br />
	With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here<br />
	Will I set up my everlasting rest,<br />
	And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars<br />
	From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!<br />
	Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you<br />
	The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss<br />
	A dateless bargain to engrossing death!<br />
	Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!<br />
	Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on<br />
	The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!<br />
	Here&#39;s to my love!</p>
<p>
	(Drinks)</p>
<p>
	O true apothecary!<br />
	Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.</p>
<p>
	(Dies)</p>
<p>
	(Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade)</p>
<p>
	FRIAR LAURENCE<br />
	Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night<br />
	Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who&#39;s there?</p>
<p>
	BALTHASAR<br />
	Here&#39;s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.</p>
<p>
	FRIAR LAURENCE<br />
	Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,<br />
	What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light<br />
	To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,<br />
	It burneth in the Capel&#39;s monument.</p>
<p>
	BALTHASAR<br />
	It doth so, holy sir; and there&#39;s my master,<br />
	One that you love.</p>
<p>
	FRIAR LAURENCE<br />
	Who is it?</p>
<p>
	BALTHASAR<br />
	Romeo.</p>
<p>
	FRIAR LAURENCE<br />
	How long hath he been there?</p>
<p>
	BALTHASAR<br />
	Full half an hour.</p>
<p>
	FRIAR LAURENCE<br />
	Go with me to the vault.</p>
<p>
	BALTHASAR<br />
	I dare not, sir<br />
	My master knows not but I am gone hence;<br />
	And fearfully did menace me with death,<br />
	If I did stay to look on his intents.</p>
<p>
	FRIAR LAURENCE<br />
	Stay, then; I&#39;ll go alone. Fear comes upon me:<br />
	O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.</p>
<p>
	BALTHASAR<br />
	As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,<br />
	I dreamt my master and another fought,<br />
	And that my master slew him.</p>
<p>
	FRIAR LAURENCE<br />
	Romeo!</p>
<p>
	(Advances)</p>
<p>
	Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains<br />
	The stony entrance of this sepulchre?<br />
	What mean these masterless and gory swords<br />
	To lie discolour&#39;d by this place of peace?</p>
<p>
	(Enters the tomb)</p>
<p>
	Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?<br />
	And steep&#39;d in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour<br />
	Is guilty of this lamentable chance!<br />
	The lady stirs.</p>
<p>
	(JULIET wakes)</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	O comfortable friar! where is my lord?<br />
	I do remember well where I should be,<br />
	And there I am. Where is my Romeo?</p>
<p>
	(Noise within)</p>
<p>
	FRIAR LAURENCE<br />
	I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest<br />
	Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:<br />
	A greater power than we can contradict<br />
	Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.<br />
	Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;<br />
	And Paris too. Come, I&#39;ll dispose of thee<br />
	Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:<br />
	Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;<br />
	Come, go, good Juliet,</p>
<p>
	(Noise again)</p>
<p>
	I dare no longer stay.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.</p>
<p>
	(Exit FRIAR LAURENCE)</p>
<p>
	What&#39;s here? a cup, closed in my true love&#39;s hand?<br />
	Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:<br />
	O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop<br />
	To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;<br />
	Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,<br />
	To make die with a restorative.</p>
<p>
	(Kisses him)</p>
<p>
	Thy lips are warm.</p>
<p>
	First Watchman<br />
	[Within] Lead, boy: which way?</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Yea, noise? then I&#39;ll be brief. O happy dagger!</p>
<p>
	(Snatching ROMEO&#39;s dagger)</p>
<p>
	This is thy sheath;</p>
<p>
	(Stabs herself)</p>
<p>
	there rust, and let me die.</p>
<p>
	(Falls on ROMEO&#39;s body, and dies)</p>
<p>
	(Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS)</p>
<p>
	PAGE<br />
	This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.</p>
<p>
	First Watchman<br />
	The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:<br />
	Go, some of you, whoe&#39;er you find attach.<br />
	Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,<br />
	And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,<br />
	Who here hath lain these two days buried.<br />
	Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:<br />
	Raise up the Montagues: some others search:<br />
	We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;<br />
	But the true ground of all these piteous woes<br />
	We cannot without circumstance descry.</p>
<p>
	(Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR)</p>
<p>
	Second Watchman<br />
	Here&#39;s Romeo&#39;s man; we found him in the churchyard.</p>
<p>
	First Watchman<br />
	Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.</p>
<p>
	(Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE)</p>
<p>
	Third Watchman<br />
	Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:<br />
	We took this mattock and this spade from him,<br />
	As he was coming from this churchyard side.</p>
<p>
	First Watchman<br />
	A great suspicion: stay the friar too.</p>
<p>
	(Enter the PRINCE and Attendants)</p>
<p>
	PRINCE<br />
	What misadventure is so early up,<br />
	That calls our person from our morning&#39;s rest?</p>
<p>
	(Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others)</p>
<p>
	CAPULET<br />
	What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	The people in the street cry Romeo,<br />
	Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,<br />
	With open outcry toward our monument.</p>
<p>
	PRINCE<br />
	What fear is this which startles in our ears?</p>
<p>
	First Watchman<br />
	Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;<br />
	And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,<br />
	Warm and new kill&#39;d.</p>
<p>
	PRINCE<br />
	Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.</p>
<p>
	First Watchman<br />
	Here is a friar, and slaughter&#39;d Romeo&#39;s man;<br />
	With instruments upon them, fit to open<br />
	These dead men&#39;s tombs.</p>
<p>
	CAPULET<br />
	O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!<br />
	This dagger hath mista&#39;en--for, lo, his house<br />
	Is empty on the back of Montague,--<br />
	And it mis-sheathed in my daughter&#39;s bosom!</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	O me! this sight of death is as a bell,<br />
	That warns my old age to a sepulchre.</p>
<p>
	(Enter MONTAGUE and others)</p>
<p>
	PRINCE<br />
	Come, Montague; for thou art early up,<br />
	To see thy son and heir more early down.</p>
<p>
	MONTAGUE<br />
	Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;<br />
	Grief of my son&#39;s exile hath stopp&#39;d her breath:<br />
	What further woe conspires against mine age?</p>
<p>
	PRINCE<br />
	Look, and thou shalt see.</p>
<p>
	MONTAGUE<br />
	O thou untaught! what manners is in this?<br />
	To press before thy father to a grave?</p>
<p>
	PRINCE<br />
	Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,<br />
	Till we can clear these ambiguities,<br />
	And know their spring, their head, their<br />
	true descent;<br />
	And then will I be general of your woes,<br />
	And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,<br />
	And let mischance be slave to patience.<br />
	Bring forth the parties of suspicion.</p>
<p>
	FRIAR LAURENCE<br />
	I am the greatest, able to do least,<br />
	Yet most suspected, as the time and place<br />
	Doth make against me of this direful murder;<br />
	And here I stand, both to impeach and purge<br />
	Myself condemned and myself excused.</p>
<p>
	PRINCE<br />
	Then say at once what thou dost know in this.</p>
<p>
	FRIAR LAURENCE<br />
	I will be brief, for my short date of breath<br />
	Is not so long as is a tedious tale.<br />
	Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;<br />
	And she, there dead, that Romeo&#39;s faithful wife:<br />
	I married them; and their stol&#39;n marriage-day<br />
	Was Tybalt&#39;s dooms-day, whose untimely death<br />
	Banish&#39;d the new-made bridegroom from the city,<br />
	For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.<br />
	You, to remove that siege of grief from her,<br />
	Betroth&#39;d and would have married her perforce<br />
	To County Paris: then comes she to me,<br />
	And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean<br />
	To rid her from this second marriage,<br />
	Or in my cell there would she kill herself.<br />
	Then gave I her, so tutor&#39;d by my art,<br />
	A sleeping potion; which so took effect<br />
	As I intended, for it wrought on her<br />
	The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,<br />
	That he should hither come as this dire night,<br />
	To help to take her from her borrow&#39;d grave,<br />
	Being the time the potion&#39;s force should cease.<br />
	But he which bore my letter, Friar John,<br />
	Was stay&#39;d by accident, and yesternight<br />
	Return&#39;d my letter back. Then all alone<br />
	At the prefixed hour of her waking,<br />
	Came I to take her from her kindred&#39;s vault;<br />
	Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,<br />
	Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:<br />
	But when I came, some minute ere the time<br />
	Of her awaking, here untimely lay<br />
	The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.<br />
	She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,<br />
	And bear this work of heaven with patience:<br />
	But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;<br />
	And she, too desperate, would not go with me,<br />
	But, as it seems, did violence on herself.<br />
	All this I know; and to the marriage<br />
	Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this<br />
	Miscarried by my fault, let my old life<br />
	Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,<br />
	Unto the rigour of severest law.</p>
<p>
	PRINCE<br />
	We still have known thee for a holy man.<br />
	Where&#39;s Romeo&#39;s man? what can he say in this?</p>
<p>
	BALTHASAR<br />
	I brought my master news of Juliet&#39;s death;<br />
	And then in post he came from Mantua<br />
	To this same place, to this same monument.<br />
	This letter he early bid me give his father,<br />
	And threatened me with death, going in the vault,<br />
	I departed not and left him there.</p>
<p>
	PRINCE<br />
	Give me the letter; I will look on it.<br />
	Where is the county&#39;s page, that raised the watch?<br />
	Sirrah, what made your master in this place?</p>
<p>
	PAGE<br />
	He came with flowers to strew his lady&#39;s grave;<br />
	And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:<br />
	Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;<br />
	And by and by my master drew on him;<br />
	And then I ran away to call the watch.</p>
<p>
	PRINCE<br />
	This letter doth make good the friar&#39;s words,<br />
	Their course of love, the tidings of her death:<br />
	And here he writes that he did buy a poison<br />
	Of a poor &#39;pothecary, and therewithal<br />
	Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.<br />
	Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!<br />
	See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,<br />
	That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.<br />
	And I for winking at your discords too<br />
	Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish&#39;d.</p>
<p>
	CAPULET<br />
	O brother Montague, give me thy hand:<br />
	This is my daughter&#39;s jointure, for no more<br />
	Can I demand.</p>
<p>
	MONTAGUE<br />
	But I can give thee more:<br />
	For I will raise her statue in pure gold;<br />
	That while Verona by that name is known,<br />
	There shall no figure at such rate be set<br />
	As that of true and faithful Juliet.</p>
<p>
	CAPULET<br />
	As rich shall Romeo&#39;s by his lady&#39;s lie;<br />
	Poor sacrifices of our enmity!</p>
<p>
	PRINCE<br />
	A glooming peace this morning with it brings;<br />
	The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:<br />
	Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;<br />
	Some shall be pardon&#39;d, and some punished:<br />
	For never was a story of more woe<br />
	Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</p>
