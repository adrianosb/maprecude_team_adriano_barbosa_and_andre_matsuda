	SCENE. Capulet&#39;s orchard.</p>
<p>
	(Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window)</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:<br />
	It was the nightingale, and not the lark,<br />
	That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;<br />
	Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:<br />
	Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	It was the lark, the herald of the morn,<br />
	No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks<br />
	Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:<br />
	Night&#39;s candles are burnt out, and jocund day<br />
	Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.<br />
	I must be gone and live, or stay and die.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:<br />
	It is some meteor that the sun exhales,<br />
	To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,<br />
	And light thee on thy way to Mantua:<br />
	Therefore stay yet; thou need&#39;st not to be gone.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Let me be ta&#39;en, let me be put to death;<br />
	I am content, so thou wilt have it so.<br />
	I&#39;ll say yon grey is not the morning&#39;s eye,<br />
	&#39;Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia&#39;s brow;<br />
	Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat<br />
	The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:<br />
	I have more care to stay than will to go:<br />
	Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.<br />
	How is&#39;t, my soul? let&#39;s talk; it is not day.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!<br />
	It is the lark that sings so out of tune,<br />
	Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.<br />
	Some say the lark makes sweet division;<br />
	This doth not so, for she divideth us:<br />
	Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,<br />
	O, now I would they had changed voices too!<br />
	Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,<br />
	Hunting thee hence with hunt&#39;s-up to the day,<br />
	O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!</p>
<p>
	(Enter Nurse, to the chamber)</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	Madam!</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Nurse?</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:<br />
	The day is broke; be wary, look about.</p>
<p>
	(Exit)</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Then, window, let day in, and let life out.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I&#39;ll descend.</p>
<p>
	(He goeth down)</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!<br />
	I must hear from thee every day in the hour,<br />
	For in a minute there are many days:<br />
	O, by this count I shall be much in years<br />
	Ere I again behold my Romeo!</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Farewell!<br />
	I will omit no opportunity<br />
	That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	O think&#39;st thou we shall ever meet again?</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve<br />
	For sweet discourses in our time to come.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	O God, I have an ill-divining soul!<br />
	Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,<br />
	As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:<br />
	Either my eyesight fails, or thou look&#39;st pale.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:<br />
	Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!</p>
<p>
	(Exit)</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:<br />
	If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.<br />
	That is renown&#39;d for faith? Be fickle, fortune;<br />
	For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,<br />
	But send him back.</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	[Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Who is&#39;t that calls? is it my lady mother?<br />
	Is she not down so late, or up so early?<br />
	What unaccustom&#39;d cause procures her hither?</p>
<p>
	Enter LADY CAPULET</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	Why, how now, Juliet!</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Madam, I am not well.</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	Evermore weeping for your cousin&#39;s death?<br />
	What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?<br />
	An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;<br />
	Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;<br />
	But much of grief shows still some want of wit.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend<br />
	Which you weep for.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Feeling so the loss,<br />
	Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	Well, girl, thou weep&#39;st not so much for his death,<br />
	As that the villain lives which slaughter&#39;d him.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	What villain madam?</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	That same villain, Romeo.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	[Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.&mdash;<br />
	God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;<br />
	And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	That is, because the traitor murderer lives.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:<br />
	Would none but I might venge my cousin&#39;s death!</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:<br />
	Then weep no more. I&#39;ll send to one in Mantua,<br />
	Where that same banish&#39;d runagate doth live,<br />
	Shall give him such an unaccustom&#39;d dram,<br />
	That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:<br />
	And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Indeed, I never shall be satisfied<br />
	With Romeo, till I behold him&mdash;dead&mdash;<br />
	Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex&#39;d.<br />
	Madam, if you could find out but a man<br />
	To bear a poison, I would temper it;<br />
	That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,<br />
	Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors<br />
	To hear him named, and cannot come to him.<br />
	To wreak the love I bore my cousin<br />
	Upon his body that slaughter&#39;d him!</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	Find thou the means, and I&#39;ll find such a man.<br />
	But now I&#39;ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	And joy comes well in such a needy time:<br />
	What are they, I beseech your ladyship?</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;<br />
	One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,<br />
	Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,<br />
	That thou expect&#39;st not nor I look&#39;d not for.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Madam, in happy time, what day is that?</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,<br />
	The gallant, young and noble gentleman,<br />
	The County Paris, at Saint Peter&#39;s Church,<br />
	Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Now, by Saint Peter&#39;s Church and Peter too,<br />
	He shall not make me there a joyful bride.<br />
	I wonder at this haste; that I must wed<br />
	Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.<br />
	I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,<br />
	I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,<br />
	It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,<br />
	Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,<br />
	And see how he will take it at your hands.</p>
<p>
	(Enter CAPULET and Nurse)</p>
<p>
	CAPULET<br />
	When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;<br />
	But for the sunset of my brother&#39;s son<br />
	It rains downright.<br />
	How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?<br />
	Evermore showering? In one little body<br />
	Thou counterfeit&#39;st a bark, a sea, a wind;<br />
	For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,<br />
	Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,<br />
	Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;<br />
	Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,<br />
	Without a sudden calm, will overset<br />
	Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!<br />
	Have you deliver&#39;d to her our decree?</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.<br />
	I would the fool were married to her grave!</p>
<p>
	CAPULET<br />
	Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.<br />
	How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?<br />
	Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,<br />
	Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought<br />
	So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:<br />
	Proud can I never be of what I hate;<br />
	But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.</p>
<p>
	CAPULET<br />
	How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?<br />
	&#39;Proud,&#39; and &#39;I thank you,&#39; and &#39;I thank you not;&#39;<br />
	And yet &#39;not proud,&#39; mistress minion, you,<br />
	Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,<br />
	But fettle your fine joints &#39;gainst Thursday next,<br />
	To go with Paris to Saint Peter&#39;s Church,<br />
	Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.<br />
	Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!<br />
	You tallow-face!</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	Fie, fie! what, are you mad?</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Good father, I beseech you on my knees,<br />
	Hear me with patience but to speak a word.</p>
<p>
	CAPULET<br />
	Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!<br />
	I tell thee what: get thee to church o&#39; Thursday,<br />
	Or never after look me in the face:<br />
	Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;<br />
	My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest<br />
	That God had lent us but this only child;<br />
	But now I see this one is one too much,<br />
	And that we have a curse in having her:<br />
	Out on her, hilding!</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	God in heaven bless her!<br />
	You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.</p>
<p>
	CAPULET<br />
	And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,<br />
	Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	I speak no treason.</p>
<p>
	CAPULET<br />
	O, God ye god-den.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	May not one speak?</p>
<p>
	CAPULET<br />
	Peace, you mumbling fool!<br />
	Utter your gravity o&#39;er a gossip&#39;s bowl;<br />
	For here we need it not.</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	You are too hot.</p>
<p>
	CAPULET<br />
	God&#39;s bread! it makes me mad:<br />
	Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,<br />
	Alone, in company, still my care hath been<br />
	To have her match&#39;d: and having now provided<br />
	A gentleman of noble parentage,<br />
	Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train&#39;d,<br />
	Stuff&#39;d, as they say, with honourable parts,<br />
	Proportion&#39;d as one&#39;s thought would wish a man;<br />
	And then to have a wretched puling fool,<br />
	A whining mammet, in her fortune&#39;s tender,<br />
	To answer &#39;I&#39;ll not wed; I cannot love,<br />
	I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.&#39;<br />
	But, as you will not wed, I&#39;ll pardon you:<br />
	Graze where you will you shall not house with me:<br />
	Look to&#39;t, think on&#39;t, I do not use to jest.<br />
	Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:<br />
	An you be mine, I&#39;ll give you to my friend;<br />
	And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in<br />
	the streets,<br />
	For, by my soul, I&#39;ll ne&#39;er acknowledge thee,<br />
	Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:<br />
	Trust to&#39;t, bethink you; I&#39;ll not be forsworn.</p>
<p>
	(Exit)</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,<br />
	That sees into the bottom of my grief?<br />
	O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!<br />
	Delay this marriage for a month, a week;<br />
	Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed<br />
	In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	Talk not to me, for I&#39;ll not speak a word:<br />
	Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.</p>
<p>
	(Exit)</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	O God!&mdash;O nurse, how shall this be prevented?<br />
	My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;<br />
	How shall that faith return again to earth,<br />
	Unless that husband send it me from heaven<br />
	By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.<br />
	Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems<br />
	Upon so soft a subject as myself!<br />
	What say&#39;st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?<br />
	Some comfort, nurse.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	Faith, here it is.<br />
	Romeo is banish&#39;d; and all the world to nothing,<br />
	That he dares ne&#39;er come back to challenge you;<br />
	Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.<br />
	Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,<br />
	I think it best you married with the county.<br />
	O, he&#39;s a lovely gentleman!<br />
	Romeo&#39;s a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,<br />
	Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye<br />
	As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,<br />
	I think you are happy in this second match,<br />
	For it excels your first: or if it did not,<br />
	Your first is dead; or &#39;twere as good he were,<br />
	As living here and you no use of him.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Speakest thou from thy heart?</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	And from my soul too;<br />
	Or else beshrew them both.</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Amen!</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	What?</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.<br />
	Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,<br />
	Having displeased my father, to Laurence&#39; cell,<br />
	To make confession and to be absolved.</p>
<p>
	Nurse<br />
	Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.</p>
<p>
	(Exit)</p>
<p>
	JULIET<br />
	Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!<br />
	Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,<br />
	Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue<br />
	Which she hath praised him with above compare<br />
	So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;<br />
	Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.<br />
	I&#39;ll to the friar, to know his remedy:<br />
	If all else fail, myself have power to die.</p>
<p>
	(Exit)</p>
