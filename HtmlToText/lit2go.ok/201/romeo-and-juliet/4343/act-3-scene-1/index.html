	SCENE. A public place.</p>
<p>
	(Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants)</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	I pray thee, good Mercutio, let&#39;s retire:<br />
	The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,<br />
	And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;<br />
	For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Thou art like one of those fellows that when he<br />
	enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword<br />
	upon the table and says &#39;God send me no need of<br />
	thee!&#39; and by the operation of the second cup draws<br />
	it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Am I like such a fellow?</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as<br />
	any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as<br />
	soon moody to be moved.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	And what to?</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Nay, an there were two such, we should have none<br />
	shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,<br />
	thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,<br />
	or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou<br />
	wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no<br />
	other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what<br />
	eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?<br />
	Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of<br />
	meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as<br />
	an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a<br />
	man for coughing in the street, because he hath<br />
	wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:<br />
	didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing<br />
	his new doublet before Easter? with another, for<br />
	tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou<br />
	wilt tutor me from quarrelling!</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man<br />
	should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	The fee-simple! O simple!</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	By my head, here come the Capulets.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	By my heel, I care not.</p>
<p>
	(Enter TYBALT and others)</p>
<p>
	TYBALT<br />
	Follow me close, for I will speak to them.<br />
	Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	And but one word with one of us? couple it with<br />
	something; make it a word and a blow.</p>
<p>
	TYBALT<br />
	You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you<br />
	will give me occasion.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Could you not take some occasion without giving?</p>
<p>
	TYBALT<br />
	Mercutio, thou consort&#39;st with Romeo,--</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an<br />
	thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but<br />
	discords: here&#39;s my fiddlestick; here&#39;s that shall<br />
	make you dance. &#39;Zounds, consort!</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	We talk here in the public haunt of men:<br />
	Either withdraw unto some private place,<br />
	And reason coldly of your grievances,<br />
	Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Men&#39;s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;<br />
	I will not budge for no man&#39;s pleasure, I.</p>
<p>
	(Enter ROMEO)</p>
<p>
	TYBALT<br />
	Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	But I&#39;ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:<br />
	Marry, go before to field, he&#39;ll be your follower;<br />
	Your worship in that sense may call him &#39;man.&#39;</p>
<p>
	TYBALT<br />
	Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford<br />
	No better term than this,--thou art a villain.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee<br />
	Doth much excuse the appertaining rage<br />
	To such a greeting: villain am I none;<br />
	Therefore farewell; I see thou know&#39;st me not.</p>
<p>
	TYBALT<br />
	Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries<br />
	That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	I do protest, I never injured thee,<br />
	But love thee better than thou canst devise,<br />
	Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:<br />
	And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender<br />
	As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!<br />
	Alla stoccata carries it away.</p>
<p>
	(Draws)</p>
<p>
	Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?</p>
<p>
	TYBALT<br />
	What wouldst thou have with me?</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine<br />
	lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you<br />
	shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the<br />
	eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher<br />
	by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your<br />
	ears ere it be out.</p>
<p>
	TYBALT<br />
	I am for you.</p>
<p>
	(Drawing)</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Come, sir, your passado.</p>
<p>
	(They fight)</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.<br />
	Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!<br />
	Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath<br />
	Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:<br />
	Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!</p>
<p>
	(TYBALT under ROMEO&#39;s arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers)</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	I am hurt.<br />
	A plague o&#39; both your houses! I am sped.<br />
	Is he gone, and hath nothing?</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	What, art thou hurt?</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, &#39;tis enough.<br />
	Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.</p>
<p>
	(Exit Page)</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	No, &#39;tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a<br />
	church-door; but &#39;tis enough,&#39;twill serve: ask for<br />
	me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I<br />
	am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o&#39;<br />
	both your houses! &#39;Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a<br />
	cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a<br />
	rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of<br />
	arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I<br />
	was hurt under your arm.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	I thought all for the best.</p>
<p>
	MERCUTIO<br />
	Help me into some house, Benvolio,<br />
	Or I shall faint. A plague o&#39; both your houses!<br />
	They have made worms&#39; meat of me: I have it,<br />
	And soundly too: your houses!</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO)</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	This gentleman, the prince&#39;s near ally,<br />
	My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt<br />
	In my behalf; my reputation stain&#39;d<br />
	With Tybalt&#39;s slander,--Tybalt, that an hour<br />
	Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,<br />
	Thy beauty hath made me effeminate<br />
	And in my temper soften&#39;d valour&#39;s steel!</p>
<p>
	(Re-enter BENVOLIO)</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio&#39;s dead!<br />
	That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,<br />
	Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	This day&#39;s black fate on more days doth depend;<br />
	This but begins the woe, others must end.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!<br />
	Away to heaven, respective lenity,<br />
	And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!</p>
<p>
	(Re-enter TYBALT)</p>
<p>
	Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,<br />
	That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio&#39;s soul<br />
	Is but a little way above our heads,<br />
	Staying for thine to keep him company:<br />
	Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.</p>
<p>
	TYBALT<br />
	Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,<br />
	Shalt with him hence.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	This shall determine that.</p>
<p>
	They fight; TYBALT falls</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Romeo, away, be gone!<br />
	The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.<br />
	Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,<br />
	If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	O, I am fortune&#39;s fool!</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Why dost thou stay?</p>
<p>
	(Exit ROMEO)</p>
<p>
	(Enter Citizens, &amp; c)</p>
<p>
	First Citizen<br />
	Which way ran he that kill&#39;d Mercutio?<br />
	Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	There lies that Tybalt.</p>
<p>
	First Citizen<br />
	Up, sir, go with me;<br />
	I charge thee in the princes name, obey.</p>
<p>
	(Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others)</p>
<p>
	PRINCE<br />
	Where are the vile beginners of this fray?</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	O noble prince, I can discover all<br />
	The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:<br />
	There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,<br />
	That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother&#39;s child!<br />
	O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt<br />
	O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,<br />
	For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.<br />
	O cousin, cousin!</p>
<p>
	PRINCE<br />
	Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo&#39;s hand did slay;<br />
	Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink<br />
	How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal<br />
	Your high displeasure: all this uttered<br />
	With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow&#39;d,<br />
	Could not take truce with the unruly spleen<br />
	Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts<br />
	With piercing steel at bold Mercutio&#39;s breast,<br />
	Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,<br />
	And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats<br />
	Cold death aside, and with the other sends<br />
	It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,<br />
	Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,<br />
	&#39;Hold, friends! friends, part!&#39; and, swifter than<br />
	his tongue,<br />
	His agile arm beats down their fatal points,<br />
	And &#39;twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm<br />
	An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life<br />
	Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;<br />
	But by and by comes back to Romeo,<br />
	Who had but newly entertain&#39;d revenge,<br />
	And to &#39;t they go like lightning, for, ere I<br />
	Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.<br />
	And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.<br />
	This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	He is a kinsman to the Montague;<br />
	Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:<br />
	Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,<br />
	And all those twenty could but kill one life.<br />
	I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;<br />
	Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.</p>
<p>
	PRINCE<br />
	Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;<br />
	Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?</p>
<p>
	MONTAGUE<br />
	Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio&#39;s friend;<br />
	His fault concludes but what the law should end,<br />
	The life of Tybalt.</p>
<p>
	PRINCE<br />
	And for that offence<br />
	Immediately we do exile him hence:<br />
	I have an interest in your hate&#39;s proceeding,<br />
	My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;<br />
	But I&#39;ll amerce you with so strong a fine<br />
	That you shall all repent the loss of mine:<br />
	I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;<br />
	Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:<br />
	Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,<br />
	Else, when he&#39;s found, that hour is his last.<br />
	Bear hence this body and attend our will:<br />
	Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.</p>
