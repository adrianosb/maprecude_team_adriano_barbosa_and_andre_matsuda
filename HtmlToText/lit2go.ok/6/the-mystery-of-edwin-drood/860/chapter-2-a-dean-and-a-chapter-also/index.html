                <p>
	Whosoever has observed that sedate and clerical bird, the rook, may perhaps have noticed that when he wings his way homeward towards nightfall, in a sedate and clerical company, two rooks will suddenly detach themselves from the rest, will retrace their flight for some distance, and will there poise and linger; conveying to mere men the fancy that it is of some occult importance to the body politic, that this artful couple should pretend to have renounced connection with it.</p>
<p>
	Similarly, service being over in the old Cathedral with the square tower, and the choir scuffling out again, and divers venerable persons of rook&ndash;like aspect dispersing, two of these latter retrace their steps, and walk together in the echoing Close.</p>
<p>
	Not only is the day waning, but the year.&nbsp; The low sun is fiery and yet cold behind the monastery ruin, and the Virginia creeper on the Cathedral wall has showered half its deep&ndash;red leaves down on the pavement.&nbsp; There has been rain this afternoon, and a wintry shudder goes among the little pools on the cracked, uneven flag&ndash;stones, and through the giant elm&ndash;trees as they shed a gust of tears.&nbsp; Their fallen leaves lie strewn thickly about.&nbsp; Some of these leaves, in a timid rush, seek sanctuary within the low arched Cathedral door; but two men coming out resist them, and cast them forth again with their feet; this done, one of the two locks the door with a goodly key, and the other flits away with a folio music&ndash;book.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Mr. Jasper was that, Tope?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Yes, Mr. Dean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;He has stayed late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Yes, Mr. Dean.&nbsp; I have stayed for him, your Reverence.&nbsp; He has been took a little poorly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Say &ldquo;taken,&rdquo; Tope &ndash; to the Dean,&rsquo; the younger rook interposes in a low tone with this touch of correction, as who should say: &lsquo;You may offer bad grammar to the laity, or the humbler clergy, not to the Dean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Mr. Tope, Chief Verger and Showman, and accustomed to be high with excursion parties, declines with a silent loftiness to perceive that any suggestion has been tendered to him.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;And when and how has Mr. Jasper been taken &ndash; for, as Mr. Crisparkle has remarked, it is better to say taken &ndash; taken &ndash; &rsquo; repeats the Dean; &lsquo;when and how has Mr. Jasper been Taken &ndash; &rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Taken, sir,&rsquo; Tope deferentially murmurs.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo; &ndash; Poorly, Tope?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Why, sir, Mr. Jasper was that breathed &ndash; &rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;That breathed,&rdquo; Tope,&rsquo; Mr. Crisparkle interposes with the same touch as before.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not English &ndash; to the Dean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Breathed to that extent,&rsquo; the Dean (not unflattered by this indirect homage) condescendingly remarks, &lsquo;would be preferable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Mr. Jasper&rsquo;s breathing was so remarkably short&rsquo; &ndash; thus discreetly does Mr. Tope work his way round the sunken rock &ndash; &lsquo;when he came in, that it distressed him mightily to get his notes out: which was perhaps the cause of his having a kind of fit on him after a little.&nbsp; His memory grew DAZED.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Tope, with his eyes on the Reverend Mr. Crisparkle, shoots this word out, as defying him to improve upon it: &lsquo;and a dimness and giddiness crept over him as strange as ever I saw: though he didn&rsquo;t seem to mind it particularly, himself.&nbsp; However, a little time and a little water brought him out of his DAZE.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Tope repeats the word and its emphasis, with the air of saying: &lsquo;As I have made a success, I&rsquo;ll make it again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;And Mr. Jasper has gone home quite himself, has he?&rsquo; asked the Dean.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Your Reverence, he has gone home quite himself.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m glad to see he&rsquo;s having his fire kindled up, for it&rsquo;s chilly after the wet, and the Cathedral had both a damp feel and a damp touch this afternoon, and he was very shivery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	They all three look towards an old stone gatehouse crossing the Close, with an arched thoroughfare passing beneath it.&nbsp; Through its latticed window, a fire shines out upon the fast&ndash;darkening scene, involving in shadow the pendent masses of ivy and creeper covering the building&rsquo;s front.&nbsp; As the deep Cathedral&ndash;bell strikes the hour, a ripple of wind goes through these at their distance, like a ripple of the solemn sound that hums through tomb and tower, broken niche and defaced statue, in the pile close at hand.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Is Mr. Jasper&rsquo;s nephew with him?&rsquo; the Dean asks.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; replied the Verger, &lsquo;but expected.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s his own solitary shadow betwixt his two windows &ndash; the one looking this way, and the one looking down into the High Street &ndash; drawing his own curtains now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; says the Dean, with a sprightly air of breaking up the little conference, &lsquo;I hope Mr. Jasper&rsquo;s heart may not be too much set upon his nephew.&nbsp; Our affections, however laudable, in this transitory world, should never master us; we should guide them, guide them.&nbsp; I find I am not disagreeably reminded of my dinner, by hearing my dinner&ndash;bell.&nbsp; Perhaps, Mr. Crisparkle, you will, before going home, look in on Jasper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Certainly, Mr. Dean.&nbsp; And tell him that you had the kindness to desire to know how he was?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Ay; do so, do so.&nbsp; Certainly.&nbsp; Wished to know how he was.&nbsp; By all means.&nbsp; Wished to know how he was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	With a pleasant air of patronage, the Dean as nearly cocks his quaint hat as a Dean in good spirits may, and directs his comely gaiters towards the ruddy dining&ndash;room of the snug old red&ndash;brick house where he is at present, &lsquo;in residence&rsquo; with Mrs. Dean and Miss Dean.</p>
<p>
	Mr. Crisparkle, Minor Canon, fair and rosy, and perpetually pitching himself head&ndash;foremost into all the deep running water in the surrounding country; Mr. Crisparkle, Minor Canon, early riser, musical, classical, cheerful, kind, good&ndash;natured, social, contented, and boy&ndash;like; Mr. Crisparkle, Minor Canon and good man, lately &lsquo;Coach&rsquo; upon the chief Pagan high roads, but since promoted by a patron (grateful for a well&ndash;taught son) to his present Christian beat; betakes himself to the gatehouse, on his way home to his early tea.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Sorry to hear from Tope that you have not been well, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;O, it was nothing, nothing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;You look a little worn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Do I?&nbsp; O, I don&rsquo;t think so.&nbsp; What is better, I don&rsquo;t feel so.&nbsp; Tope has made too much of it, I suspect.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s his trade to make the most of everything appertaining to the Cathedral, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I may tell the Dean &ndash; I call expressly from the Dean &ndash; that you are all right again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	The reply, with a slight smile, is: &lsquo;Certainly; with my respects and thanks to the Dean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that you expect young Drood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I expect the dear fellow every moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; He will do you more good than a doctor, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;More good than a dozen doctors.&nbsp; For I love him dearly, and I don&rsquo;t love doctors, or doctors&rsquo; stuff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Mr. Jasper is a dark man of some six&ndash;and&ndash;twenty, with thick, lustrous, well&ndash;arranged black hair and whiskers.&nbsp; He looks older than he is, as dark men often do.&nbsp; His voice is deep and good, his face and figure are good, his manner is a little sombre.&nbsp; His room is a little sombre, and may have had its influence in forming his manner.&nbsp; It is mostly in shadow.&nbsp; Even when the sun shines brilliantly, it seldom touches the grand piano in the recess, or the folio music&ndash;books on the stand, or the book&ndash;shelves on the wall, or the unfinished picture of a blooming schoolgirl hanging over the chimneypiece; her flowing brown hair tied with a blue riband, and her beauty remarkable for a quite childish, almost babyish, touch of saucy discontent, comically conscious of itself.&nbsp; (There is not the least artistic merit in this picture, which is a mere daub; but it is clear that the painter has made it humorously &ndash; one might almost say, revengefully &ndash; like the original.)</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;We shall miss you, Jasper, at the &ldquo;Alternate Musical Wednesdays&rdquo; to&ndash;night; but no doubt you are best at home.&nbsp; Good&ndash;night.&nbsp; God bless you!&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me, shep&ndash;herds, te&ndash;e&ndash;ell me; tell me&ndash;e&ndash;e, have you seen (have you seen, have you seen, have you seen) my&ndash;y&ndash;y Flo&ndash;o&ndash;ora&ndash;a pass this way!&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; Melodiously good Minor Canon the Reverend Septimus Crisparkle thus delivers himself, in musical rhythm, as he withdraws his amiable face from the doorway and conveys it down&ndash;stairs.</p>
<p>
	Sounds of recognition and greeting pass between the Reverend Septimus and somebody else, at the stair&ndash;foot.&nbsp; Mr. Jasper listens, starts from his chair, and catches a young fellow in his arms, exclaiming:</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;My dear Edwin!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;My dear Jack!&nbsp; So glad to see you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Get off your greatcoat, bright boy, and sit down here in your own corner.&nbsp; Your feet are not wet?&nbsp; Pull your boots off.&nbsp; Do pull your boots off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;My dear Jack, I am as dry as a bone.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t moddley&ndash;coddley, there&rsquo;s a good fellow.&nbsp; I like anything better than being moddley&ndash;coddleyed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	With the check upon him of being unsympathetically restrained in a genial outburst of enthusiasm, Mr. Jasper stands still, and looks on intently at the young fellow, divesting himself of his outward coat, hat, gloves, and so forth.&nbsp; Once for all, a look of intentness and intensity &ndash; a look of hungry, exacting, watchful, and yet devoted affection &ndash; is always, now and ever afterwards, on the Jasper face whenever the Jasper face is addressed in this direction.&nbsp; And whenever it is so addressed, it is never, on this occasion or on any other, dividedly addressed; it is always concentrated.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Now I am right, and now I&rsquo;ll take my corner, Jack.&nbsp; Any dinner, Jack?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Mr. Jasper opens a door at the upper end of the room, and discloses a small inner room pleasantly lighted and prepared, wherein a comely dame is in the act of setting dishes on table.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;What a jolly old Jack it is!&rsquo; cries the young fellow, with a clap of his hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look here, Jack; tell me; whose birthday is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Not yours, I know,&rsquo; Mr. Jasper answers, pausing to consider.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Not mine, you know?&nbsp; No; not mine, I know!&nbsp; Pussy&rsquo;s!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Fixed as the look the young fellow meets, is, there is yet in it some strange power of suddenly including the sketch over the chimneypiece.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Pussy&rsquo;s, Jack!&nbsp; We must drink Many happy returns to her.&nbsp; Come, uncle; take your dutiful and sharp&ndash;set nephew in to dinner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	As the boy (for he is little more) lays a hand on Jasper&rsquo;s shoulder, Jasper cordially and gaily lays a hand on his shoulder, and so Marseillaise&ndash;wise they go in to dinner.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;And, Lord! here&rsquo;s Mrs. Tope!&rsquo; cries the boy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lovelier than ever!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Never you mind me, Master Edwin,&rsquo; retorts the Verger&rsquo;s wife; &lsquo;I can take care of myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re much too handsome.&nbsp; Give me a kiss because it&rsquo;s Pussy&rsquo;s birthday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I&rsquo;d Pussy you, young man, if I was Pussy, as you call her,&rsquo; Mrs. Tope blushingly retorts, after being saluted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your uncle&rsquo;s too much wrapt up in you, that&rsquo;s where it is.&nbsp; He makes so much of you, that it&rsquo;s my opinion you think you&rsquo;ve only to call your Pussys by the dozen, to make &rsquo;em come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;You forget, Mrs. Tope,&rsquo; Mr. Jasper interposes, taking his place at the table with a genial smile, &lsquo;and so do you, Ned, that Uncle and Nephew are words prohibited here by common consent and express agreement.&nbsp; For what we are going to receive His holy name be praised!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Done like the Dean!&nbsp; Witness, Edwin Drood!&nbsp; Please to carve, Jack, for I can&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	This sally ushers in the dinner.&nbsp; Little to the present purpose, or to any purpose, is said, while it is in course of being disposed of.&nbsp; At length the cloth is drawn, and a dish of walnuts and a decanter of rich&ndash;coloured sherry are placed upon the table.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I say!&nbsp; Tell me, Jack,&rsquo; the young fellow then flows on: &lsquo;do you really and truly feel as if the mention of our relationship divided us at all?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Uncles as a rule, Ned, are so much older than their nephews,&rsquo; is the reply, &lsquo;that I have that feeling instinctively.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;As a rule!&nbsp; Ah, may&ndash;be!&nbsp; But what is a difference in age of half&ndash;a&ndash;dozen years or so? And some uncles, in large families, are even younger than their nephews.&nbsp; By George, I wish it was the case with us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Because if it was, I&rsquo;d take the lead with you, Jack, and be as wise as Begone, dull Care! that turned a young man gray, and Begone, dull Care! that turned an old man to clay. &ndash; Halloa, Jack!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t drink.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Asks why not, on Pussy&rsquo;s birthday, and no Happy returns proposed!&nbsp; Pussy, Jack, and many of &rsquo;em!&nbsp; Happy returns, I mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Laying an affectionate and laughing touch on the boy&rsquo;s extended hand, as if it were at once his giddy head and his light heart, Mr. Jasper drinks the toast in silence.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Hip, hip, hip, and nine times nine, and one to finish with, and all that, understood.&nbsp; Hooray, hooray, hooray! &ndash; And now, Jack, let&rsquo;s have a little talk about Pussy.&nbsp; Two pairs of nut&ndash;crackers?&nbsp; Pass me one, and take the other.&rsquo;&nbsp; Crack.&nbsp; &lsquo;How&rsquo;s Pussy getting on Jack?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;With her music?&nbsp; Fairly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;What a dreadfully conscientious fellow you are, Jack!&nbsp; But I know, Lord bless you!&nbsp; Inattentive, isn&rsquo;t she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;She can learn anything, if she will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;If she will!&nbsp; Egad, that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; But if she won&rsquo;t?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Crack! &ndash; on Mr. Jasper&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;How&rsquo;s she looking, Jack?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Mr. Jasper&rsquo;s concentrated face again includes the portrait as he returns: &lsquo;Very like your sketch indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I am a little proud of it,&rsquo; says the young fellow, glancing up at the sketch with complacency, and then shutting one eye, and taking a corrected prospect of it over a level bridge of nut&ndash;crackers in the air: &lsquo;Not badly hit off from memory.&nbsp; But I ought to have caught that expression pretty well, for I have seen it often enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Crack! &ndash; on Edwin Drood&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>
	Crack! &ndash; on Mr. Jasper&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;In point of fact,&rsquo; the former resumes, after some silent dipping among his fragments of walnut with an air of pique, &lsquo;I see it whenever I go to see Pussy.&nbsp; If I don&rsquo;t find it on her face, I leave it there. &ndash; You know I do, Miss Scornful Pert.&nbsp; Booh!&rsquo;&nbsp; With a twirl of the nut&ndash;crackers at the portrait.</p>
<p>
	Crack! crack! crack.&nbsp; Slowly, on Mr. Jasper&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>
	Crack.&nbsp; Sharply on the part of Edwin Drood.</p>
<p>
	Silence on both sides.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Have you lost your tongue, Jack?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Have you found yours, Ned?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;No, but really; &ndash; isn&rsquo;t it, you know, after all &ndash; &rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Mr. Jasper lifts his dark eyebrows inquiringly.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it unsatisfactory to be cut off from choice in such a matter?&nbsp; There, Jack!&nbsp; I tell you!&nbsp; If I could choose, I would choose Pussy from all the pretty girls in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;But you have not got to choose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I complain of.&nbsp; My dead and gone father and Pussy&rsquo;s dead and gone father must needs marry us together by anticipation.&nbsp; Why the &ndash; Devil, I was going to say, if it had been respectful to their memory &ndash; couldn&rsquo;t they leave us alone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Tut, tut, dear boy,&rsquo; Mr. Jasper remonstrates, in a tone of gentle deprecation.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Tut, tut?&nbsp; Yes, Jack, it&rsquo;s all very well for you.&nbsp; You can take it easily.&nbsp; Your life is not laid down to scale, and lined and dotted out for you, like a surveyor&rsquo;s plan.&nbsp; You have no uncomfortable suspicion that you are forced upon anybody, nor has anybody an uncomfortable suspicion that she is forced upon you, or that you are forced upon her.&nbsp; You can choose for yourself.&nbsp; Life, for you, is a plum with the natural bloom on; it hasn&rsquo;t been over&ndash;carefully wiped off for you &ndash; &rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t stop, dear fellow.&nbsp; Go on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Can I anyhow have hurt your feelings, Jack?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;How can you have hurt my feelings?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Good Heaven, Jack, you look frightfully ill!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a strange film come over your eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Mr. Jasper, with a forced smile, stretches out his right hand, as if at once to disarm apprehension and gain time to get better.&nbsp; After a while he says faintly:</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I have been taking opium for a pain &ndash; an agony &ndash; that sometimes overcomes me.&nbsp; The effects of the medicine steal over me like a blight or a cloud, and pass.&nbsp; You see them in the act of passing; they will be gone directly.&nbsp; Look away from me.&nbsp; They will go all the sooner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	With a scared face the younger man complies by casting his eyes downward at the ashes on the hearth.&nbsp; Not relaxing his own gaze on the fire, but rather strengthening it with a fierce, firm grip upon his elbow&ndash;chair, the elder sits for a few moments rigid, and then, with thick drops standing on his forehead, and a sharp catch of his breath, becomes as he was before.&nbsp; On his so subsiding in his chair, his nephew gently and assiduously tends him while he quite recovers.&nbsp; When Jasper is restored, he lays a tender hand upon his nephew&rsquo;s shoulder, and, in a tone of voice less troubled than the purport of his words &ndash; indeed with something of raillery or banter in it &ndash; thus addresses him:</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;There is said to be a hidden skeleton in every house; but you thought there was none in mine, dear Ned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Upon my life, Jack, I did think so.&nbsp; However, when I come to consider that even in Pussy&rsquo;s house &ndash; if she had one &ndash; and in mine &ndash; if I had one &ndash; &rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;You were going to say (but that I interrupted you in spite of myself) what a quiet life mine is.&nbsp; No whirl and uproar around me, no distracting commerce or calculation, no risk, no change of place, myself devoted to the art I pursue, my business my pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I really was going to say something of the kind, Jack; but you see, you, speaking of yourself, almost necessarily leave out much that I should have put in.&nbsp; For instance: I should have put in the foreground your being so much respected as Lay Precentor, or Lay Clerk, or whatever you call it, of this Cathedral; your enjoying the reputation of having done such wonders with the choir; your choosing your society, and holding such an independent position in this queer old place; your gift of teaching (why, even Pussy, who don&rsquo;t like being taught, says there never was such a Master as you are!), and your connexion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Yes; I saw what you were tending to.&nbsp; I hate it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Hate it, Jack?&rsquo;&nbsp; (Much bewildered.)</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I hate it.&nbsp; The cramped monotony of my existence grinds me away by the grain.&nbsp; How does our service sound to you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Beautiful!&nbsp; Quite celestial!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;It often sounds to me quite devilish.&nbsp; I am so weary of it.&nbsp; The echoes of my own voice among the arches seem to mock me with my daily drudging round.&nbsp; No wretched monk who droned his life away in that gloomy place, before me, can have been more tired of it than I am.&nbsp; He could take for relief (and did take) to carving demons out of the stalls and seats and desks.&nbsp; What shall I do?&nbsp; Must I take to carving them out of my heart?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I thought you had so exactly found your niche in life, Jack,&rsquo; Edwin Drood returns, astonished, bending forward in his chair to lay a sympathetic hand on Jasper&rsquo;s knee, and looking at him with an anxious face.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I know you thought so.&nbsp; They all think so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Well, I suppose they do,&rsquo; says Edwin, meditating aloud.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pussy thinks so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;When did she tell you that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;The last time I was here.&nbsp; You remember when.&nbsp; Three months ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;How did she phrase it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;O, she only said that she had become your pupil, and that you were made for your vocation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	The younger man glances at the portrait.&nbsp; The elder sees it in him.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Anyhow, my dear Ned,&rsquo; Jasper resumes, as he shakes his head with a grave cheerfulness, &lsquo;I must subdue myself to my vocation: which is much the same thing outwardly.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too late to find another now.&nbsp; This is a confidence between us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;It shall be sacredly preserved, Jack.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I have reposed it in you, because &ndash; &rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I feel it, I assure you.&nbsp; Because we are fast friends, and because you love and trust me, as I love and trust you.&nbsp; Both hands, Jack.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	As each stands looking into the other&rsquo;s eyes, and as the uncle holds the nephew&rsquo;s hands, the uncle thus proceeds:</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;You know now, don&rsquo;t you, that even a poor monotonous chorister and grinder of music &ndash; in his niche &ndash; may be troubled with some stray sort of ambition, aspiration, restlessness, dissatisfaction, what shall we call it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Yes, dear Jack.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;And you will remember?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;My dear Jack, I only ask you, am I likely to forget what you have said with so much feeling?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Take it as a warning, then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	In the act of having his hands released, and of moving a step back, Edwin pauses for an instant to consider the application of these last words.&nbsp; The instant over, he says, sensibly touched:</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I am afraid I am but a shallow, surface kind of fellow, Jack, and that my headpiece is none of the best.&nbsp; But I needn&rsquo;t say I am young; and perhaps I shall not grow worse as I grow older.&nbsp; At all events, I hope I have something impressible within me, which feels &ndash; deeply feels &ndash; the disinterestedness of your painfully laying your inner self bare, as a warning to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Mr. Jasper&rsquo;s steadiness of face and figure becomes so marvellous that his breathing seems to have stopped.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t fail to notice, Jack, that it cost you a great effort, and that you were very much moved, and very unlike your usual self.&nbsp; Of course I knew that you were extremely fond of me, but I really was not prepared for your, as I may say, sacrificing yourself to me in that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Mr. Jasper, becoming a breathing man again without the smallest stage of transition between the two extreme states, lifts his shoulders, laughs, and waves his right arm.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;No; don&rsquo;t put the sentiment away, Jack; please don&rsquo;t; for I am very much in earnest.&nbsp; I have no doubt that that unhealthy state of mind which you have so powerfully described is attended with some real suffering, and is hard to bear.&nbsp; But let me reassure you, Jack, as to the chances of its overcoming me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I am in the way of it.&nbsp; In some few months less than another year, you know, I shall carry Pussy off from school as Mrs. Edwin Drood.&nbsp; I shall then go engineering into the East, and Pussy with me.&nbsp; And although we have our little tiffs now, arising out of a certain unavoidable flatness that attends our love&ndash;making, owing to its end being all settled beforehand, still I have no doubt of our getting on capitally then, when it&rsquo;s done and can&rsquo;t be helped.&nbsp; In short, Jack, to go back to the old song I was freely quoting at dinner (and who knows old songs better than you?), my wife shall dance, and I will sing, so merrily pass the day.&nbsp; Of Pussy&rsquo;s being beautiful there cannot be a doubt; &ndash; and when you are good besides, Little Miss Impudence,&rsquo; once more apostrophising the portrait, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll burn your comic likeness, and paint your music&ndash;master another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Mr. Jasper, with his hand to his chin, and with an expression of musing benevolence on his face, has attentively watched every animated look and gesture attending the delivery of these words.&nbsp; He remains in that attitude after they, are spoken, as if in a kind of fascination attendant on his strong interest in the youthful spirit that he loves so well.&nbsp; Then he says with a quiet smile:</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t be warned, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;No, Jack.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t be warned, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;No, Jack, not by you.&nbsp; Besides that I don&rsquo;t really consider myself in danger, I don&rsquo;t like your putting yourself in that position.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Shall we go and walk in the churchyard?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;By all means.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t mind my slipping out of it for half a moment to the Nuns&rsquo; House, and leaving a parcel there?&nbsp; Only gloves for Pussy; as many pairs of gloves as she is years old to&ndash;day.&nbsp; Rather poetical, Jack?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Mr. Jasper, still in the same attitude, murmurs: &lsquo;&ldquo;Nothing half so sweet in life,&rdquo; Ned!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the parcel in my greatcoat&ndash;pocket.&nbsp; They must be presented to&ndash;night, or the poetry is gone.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s against regulations for me to call at night, but not to leave a packet.&nbsp; I am ready, Jack!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Mr. Jasper dissolves his attitude, and they go out together.</p>
