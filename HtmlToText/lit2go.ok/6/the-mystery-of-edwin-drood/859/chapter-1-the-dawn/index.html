                <p>
	An ancient English Cathedral Tower?&nbsp; How can the ancient English Cathedral tower be here!&nbsp; The well&ndash;known massive gray square tower of its old Cathedral?&nbsp; How can that be here!&nbsp; There is no spike of rusty iron in the air, between the eye and it, from any point of the real prospect.&nbsp; What is the spike that intervenes, and who has set it up?&nbsp; Maybe it is set up by the Sultan&rsquo;s orders for the impaling of a horde of Turkish robbers, one by one.&nbsp; It is so, for cymbals clash, and the Sultan goes by to his palace in long procession.&nbsp; Ten thousand scimitars flash in the sunlight, and thrice ten thousand dancing&ndash;girls strew flowers.&nbsp; Then, follow white elephants caparisoned in countless gorgeous colours, and infinite in number and attendants.&nbsp; Still the Cathedral Tower rises in the background, where it cannot be, and still no writhing figure is on the grim spike.&nbsp; Stay!&nbsp; Is the spike so low a thing as the rusty spike on the top of a post of an old bedstead that has tumbled all awry?&nbsp; Some vague period of drowsy laughter must be devoted to the consideration of this possibility.</p>
<p>
	Shaking from head to foot, the man whose scattered consciousness has thus fantastically pieced itself together, at length rises, supports his trembling frame upon his arms, and looks around.&nbsp; He is in the meanest and closest of small rooms.&nbsp; Through the ragged window&ndash;curtain, the light of early day steals in from a miserable court.&nbsp; He lies, dressed, across a large unseemly bed, upon a bedstead that has indeed given way under the weight upon it. Lying, also dressed and also across the bed, not longwise, are a Chinaman, a Lascar, and a haggard woman.&nbsp; The two first are in a sleep or stupor; the last is blowing at a kind of pipe, to kindle it.&nbsp; And as she blows, and shading it with her lean hand, concentrates its red spark of light, it serves in the dim morning as a lamp to show him what he sees of her.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Another?&rsquo; says this woman, in a querulous, rattling whisper.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have another?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	He looks about him, with his hand to his forehead.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Ye&rsquo;ve smoked as many as five since ye come in at midnight,&rsquo; the woman goes on, as she chronically complains.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor me, poor me, my head is so bad.&nbsp; Them two come in after ye.&nbsp; Ah, poor me, the business is slack, is slack!&nbsp; Few Chinamen about the Docks, and fewer Lascars, and no ships coming in, these say!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s another ready for ye, deary.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ll remember like a good soul, won&rsquo;t ye, that the market price is dreffle high just now?&nbsp; More nor three shillings and sixpence for a thimbleful!&nbsp; And ye&rsquo;ll remember that nobody but me (and Jack Chinaman t&rsquo;other side the court; but he can&rsquo;t do it as well as me) has the true secret of mixing it?&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ll pay up accordingly, deary, won&rsquo;t ye?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	She blows at the pipe as she speaks, and, occasionally bubbling at it, inhales much of its contents.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;O me, O me, my lungs is weak, my lungs is bad!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nearly ready for ye, deary.&nbsp; Ah, poor me, poor me, my poor hand shakes like to drop off!&nbsp; I see ye coming&ndash;to, and I ses to my poor self, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have another ready for him, and he&rsquo;ll bear in mind the market price of opium, and pay according.&rdquo;&nbsp; O my poor head!&nbsp; I makes my pipes of old penny ink&ndash;bottles, ye see, deary &ndash; this is one &ndash; and I fits&ndash;in a mouthpiece, this way, and I takes my mixter out of this thimble with this little horn spoon; and so I fills, deary.&nbsp; Ah, my poor nerves!&nbsp; I got Heavens&ndash;hard drunk for sixteen year afore I took to this; but this don&rsquo;t hurt me, not to speak of.&nbsp; And it takes away the hunger as well as wittles, deary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	She hands him the nearly&ndash;emptied pipe, and sinks back, turning over on her face.</p>
<p>
	He rises unsteadily from the bed, lays the pipe upon the hearth&ndash;stone, draws back the ragged curtain, and looks with repugnance at his three companions.&nbsp; He notices that the woman has opium&ndash;smoked herself into a strange likeness of the Chinaman.&nbsp; His form of cheek, eye, and temple, and his colour, are repeated in her.&nbsp; Said Chinaman convulsively wrestles with one of his many Gods or Devils, perhaps, and snarls horribly.&nbsp; The Lascar laughs and dribbles at the mouth.&nbsp; The hostess is still.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;What visions can she have?&rsquo; the waking man muses, as he turns her face towards him, and stands looking down at it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Visions of many butchers&rsquo; shops, and public&ndash;houses, and much credit?&nbsp; Of an increase of hideous customers, and this horrible bedstead set upright again, and this horrible court swept clean?&nbsp; What can she rise to, under any quantity of opium, higher than that! &ndash; Eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	He bends down his ear, to listen to her mutterings.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Unintelligible!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	As he watches the spasmodic shoots and darts that break out of her face and limbs, like fitful lightning out of a dark sky, some contagion in them seizes upon him: insomuch that he has to withdraw himself to a lean arm&ndash;chair by the hearth &ndash; placed there, perhaps, for such emergencies &ndash; and to sit in it, holding tight, until he has got the better of this unclean spirit of imitation.</p>
<p>
	Then he comes back, pounces on the Chinaman, and seizing him with both hands by the throat, turns him violently on the bed.&nbsp; The Chinaman clutches the aggressive hands, resists, gasps, and protests.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;What do you say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	A watchful pause.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;Unintelligible!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Slowly loosening his grasp as he listens to the incoherent jargon with an attentive frown, he turns to the Lascar and fairly drags him forth upon the floor.&nbsp; As he falls, the Lascar starts into a half&ndash;risen attitude, glares with his eyes, lashes about him fiercely with his arms, and draws a phantom knife.&nbsp; It then becomes apparent that the woman has taken possession of this knife, for safety&rsquo;s sake; for, she too starting up, and restraining and expostulating with him, the knife is visible in her dress, not in his, when they drowsily drop back, side by side.</p>
<p>
	There has been chattering and clattering enough between them, but to no purpose.&nbsp; When any distinct word has been flung into the air, it has had no sense or sequence.&nbsp; Wherefore &lsquo;unintelligible!&rsquo; is again the comment of the watcher, made with some reassured nodding of his head, and a gloomy smile.&nbsp; He then lays certain silver money on the table, finds his hat, gropes his way down the broken stairs, gives a good morning to some rat&ndash;ridden doorkeeper, in bed in a black hutch beneath the stairs, and passes out.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	That same afternoon, the massive gray square tower of an old Cathedral rises before the sight of a jaded traveller.&nbsp; The bells are going for daily vesper service, and he must needs attend it, one would say, from his haste to reach the open Cathedral door.&nbsp; The choir are getting on their sullied white robes, in a hurry, when he arrives among them, gets on his own robe, and falls into the procession filing in to service.&nbsp; Then, the Sacristan locks the iron&ndash;barred gates that divide the sanctuary from the chancel, and all of the procession having scuttled into their places, hide their faces; and then the intoned words, &lsquo;WHEN THE WICKED MAN &ndash; &rsquo; rise among groins of arches and beams of roof, awakening muttered thunder.</p>
