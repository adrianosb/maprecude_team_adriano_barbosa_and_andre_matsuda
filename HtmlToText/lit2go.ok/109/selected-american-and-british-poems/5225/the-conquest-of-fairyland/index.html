                <p>
	There reigned a king in the land of Persia, mighty and great was he grown,<br />
	On the necks of the kings of the conquered earth he builded up his throne.<br />
	<br />
	There sate a king on the throne of Persia; and he was grown so proud<br />
	That all the life of the world was less to him than a passing cloud.<br />
	<br />
	He reigned in glory: joy and sorrow lying between his hands.<br />
	If he sighed a nation shook, his smile ripened the harvest of lands.<br />
	<br />
	He was the saddest man beneath the everlasting sky,<br />
	For all his glories had left him old, and the proudest king must die.<br />
	<br />
	He who was even as God to all the nations of men,<br />
	Must die as the merest peasant dies, and turn into earth again.<br />
	<br />
	And his life with the fear of death was bitter and sick and accursed,<br />
	As brackish water to drink of which is to be forever athirst.<br />
	<br />
	The hateful years rolled on and on, but once it chanced at noon<br />
	The drowsy court was thrilled to gladness, it echoed so sweet a tune.<br />
	<br />
	Low as the lapping of tile sea, as the song of the lark is clear,<br />
	Wild as the moaning of pine branches; the king was fain to hear.<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;What is the song, and who is the singer?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;before the throne<br />
	Let him come, for the songs of the world are mine, and all but this are known.&rdquo;<br />
	<br />
	Seven mighty kings went out the minstrel man to find:<br />
	And all they found was a dead cyprus soughing in the wind.<br />
	<br />
	And slower still, and sadder still the heavy winters rolled,<br />
	And the burning summers waned away, and the king grew very old;<br />
	<br />
	Dull, worn, feeble, bent; and once he thought, &ldquo;to die<br />
	Were rest, at least.&rdquo; And as he thought the music wandered by.<br />
	<br />
	Into the presence of the king, singing, the singer came,<br />
	And his face was like the spring in flower, his eyes were clear as flame.<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;What is the song you play, and what the theme your praises sing?<br />
	It is sweet; I knew not I owned a thing so sweet,&rdquo; said the weary king.<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;I sing my country,&rdquo; said the singer, &ldquo;a land that is sweeter than song.&rdquo;<br />
	&ldquo;Which of my kingdoms is your country? Thither would I along.&rdquo;<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;Great, O king, is thy power, and the earth a footstool for thy feet;<br />
	But my country is free, and my own country, and oh, my country is sweet!&rdquo;<br />
	<br />
	As he heard the eyes of the king grew young and alive with fire<br />
	&ldquo;Lo, is there left on the earth a thing to strive for, a thing to desire?<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;Where is thy country? tell me, O singer, speak thine innermost heart!<br />
	Leave thy music! speak plainly! Speak-forget thine art!&rdquo;<br />
	<br />
	The eyes of the singer shone as he sang, and his voice rang wild and free<br />
	As the elemental wind or the uncontrollable sobs of the sea.<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;O my distant home!&rdquo; he sighed; &ldquo;Oh, alas! away and afar<br />
	I watch thee now as a lost sailor watches a shining star.<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;Oh, that a wind would take me there! that a bird would set me down<br />
	Where the golden streets shine red at sunset in my father&rsquo;s town!<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;For only in dreams I see the faces of the women there,<br />
	And fain would I hear them singing once, braiding their ropes of hair.<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;Oh, I am thirsty, and long to drink of the river of Life, and I<br />
	Am fain to find my own country, where no man shall die.&rdquo;<br />
	<br />
	Out of the light of the throne the king looked down: as in the spring<br />
	The green leaves burst from their dusky buds, so was hope in the eyes of the king.<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;Lo,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will make thee great; I will make thee mighty in sway<br />
	Even as I; but the name of thy country speak, and the place and the way.&rdquo;<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;Oh, the way to my country is ever north till you pass the mouth of hell,<br />
	Past the limbo of dreams and the desolate land where shadows dwell.<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;And when you have reached the fount of wonder, you ford the waters wan<br />
	To the land of elves and the land of fairies, enchanted Masinderan.&rdquo;<br />
	<br />
	The singer ceased; and the lyre in his hand snapped, as a cord, in twain;<br />
	And neither lyre nor singer was seen in the kingdom of Persia again.<br />
	<br />
	And all the nobles gazed astounded; no man spoke a word<br />
	Till the old king said: &ldquo;Call out my armies; bring me hither a sword!&rdquo;<br />
	<br />
	As a little torrent swollen by snows is turned to a terrible stream,<br />
	So the gathering voices of all his countries cried to the king in his dream.<br />
	<br />
	Crying, &ldquo;For thee, O our king, for thee we had freely and willingly died,<br />
	Warriors, martyrs, what thou wilt; not that our lives betide<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;The worth of a thought to the king, but rather because thy rod<br />
	Is over our heads as over thine Is the changeless will of God.<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;Rather for this we beseech thee, O master, for thine own sake refrain<br />
	From the blasphemous madness of pride, from the fever of impious gain.&rdquo;<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;You seek my death,&rdquo; the king thundered; &ldquo;you cry, forbear to save<br />
	The life of a king too old to frolic; let him sleep in the grave.<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;But I will live for all your treason; and, by my own right hand!<br />
	I will set out this day with you to conquer Fairyland.&rdquo;<br />
	<br />
	Then all the nations paled aghast, for the battle to begin<br />
	Was a war with God, and a war with death, and they knew the thing was sin.<br />
	<br />
	Sick at heart they gathered together, but none denounced the wrong,<br />
	For the will of God was unseen, unsaid, and the will of the king was strong.<br />
	<br />
	So the air grew bright with spears, and the earth shook under the tread<br />
	Of the mighty horses harnessed for battle; the standards flaunted red.<br />
	<br />
	And the wind was loud with the blare of trumpets, and every house was void<br />
	Of the strength and stay of the house, and the peace of the land destroyed.<br />
	<br />
	And the growing corn was trodden under the weight of armed feet,<br />
	And every woman in Persia cursed the sound of a song too sweet,<br />
	<br />
	Cursed the insensate longing for life in the heart of a sick old man;<br />
	But the king of Persia with all his armies marched on Masinderan.<br />
	<br />
	Many a day they marched in the sun till their silver armour was lead<br />
	To sink their bodies into the grave, and many a man fell dead.<br />
	<br />
	And they passed the mouth of hell, and the shadowy country gray,<br />
	Where the air is mist and the people mist and the rain more real than they.<br />
	<br />
	And they came to the fount of wonder, and forded the waters wan,<br />
	And the king of Persia and all his armies marched on Masinderan.<br />
	<br />
	And they turned the rivers to blood, and the fields to a ravaged camp,<br />
	And they neared the golden faery town, that burned in the dusk as a lamp.<br />
	<br />
	And they stood and shouted for joy to see it stand so nigh,<br />
	Given into their hands for spoil; and their hearts beat proud and high.<br />
	<br />
	And the armies longed for the morrow, to conquer the shining town,<br />
	For there was no death in the land, neither any to strike them down.<br />
	<br />
	The hosts were many in numbers, mighty, and skilled in the strife,<br />
	And they lusted for gold and conquest as the old king lusted for life.<br />
	<br />
	And, gazing on the golden place, night took them unaware,<br />
	And black and windy grew the skies, and black the eddying air<br />
	<br />
	So long the night and black the night that fell upon their eyes,<br />
	They quaked with fear, those mighty hosts; the sun would never rise.<br />
	<br />
	Darkness and deafening sounds confused the black, tempestuous air,<br />
	And no man saw his neighbor&rsquo;s face, nor heard his neighbor&rsquo;s prayer.<br />
	<br />
	And wild with terror the raging armies fell on each other in fight,<br />
	The ground was strewn with wounded men, mad in the horrible night<br />
	<br />
	Mad with eternal pain, with darkness and stabbing blows<br />
	Rained on all sides from invisible hands till the ground was red as a rose.<br />
	<br />
	And, though he was longing for rest, none ventured to pause from the strife,<br />
	Lest haply another wound be his to poison his hateful life<br />
	<br />
	And the king entreated death; and for peace the armies prayed;<br />
	But the gifts of God are everlasting, his word is not gainsaid;<br />
	<br />
	Gold and battle are given the hosts, their boon is turned to a ban,<br />
	And the curse of the king is to reign forever in conquered Masinderan.</p>
