                <p>
	Maud Muller, on a summer&#39;s day,<br />
	Raked the meadows sweet with hay.</p>
<p>
	Beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth<br />
	Of simple beauty and rustic health.</p>
<p>
	Singing, she wrought, and her merry glee<br />
	The mock-bird echoed from his tree.</p>
<p>
	But, when she glanced to the far-off town,<br />
	White from its hill-slope looking down,</p>
<p>
	The sweet song died, and a vague unrest<br />
	And a nameless longing filled her breast--</p>
<p>
	A wish, that she hardly dared to own,<br />
	For something better than she had known.</p>
<p>
	The Judge rode slowly down the lane,<br />
	Smoothing his horse&#39;s chestnut mane.</p>
<p>
	He drew his bridle in the shade<br />
	Of the apple-trees, to greet the maid,</p>
<p>
	And ask a draught from the spring that flowed<br />
	Through the meadow across the road.</p>
<p>
	She stooped where the cool spring bubbled up,<br />
	And filled for him her small tin cup,</p>
<p>
	And blushed as she gave it, looking down<br />
	On her feet so bare, and her tattered gown.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Thanks!&quot; said the Judge, &quot;a sweeter draught<br />
	From a fairer hand was never quaffed.&quot;</p>
<p>
	He spoke of the grass and flowers and trees,<br />
	Of the singing birds and the humming bees;</p>
<p>
	Then talked of the haying, and wondered whether<br />
	The cloud in the west would bring foul weather.</p>
<p>
	And Maud forgot her briar-torn gown,<br />
	And her graceful ankles bare and brown;</p>
<p>
	And listened, while a pleasant surprise<br />
	Looked from her long-lashed hazel eyes.</p>
<p>
	At last, like one who for delay<br />
	Seeks a vain excuse, he rode away,</p>
<p>
	Maud Muller looked and sighed: &quot;Ah, me!<br />
	That I the Judge&#39;s bride might be!</p>
<p>
	&quot;He would dress me up in silks so fine,<br />
	And praise and toast me at his wine.</p>
<p>
	&quot;My father should wear a broadcloth coat;<br />
	My brother should sail a painted boat.</p>
<p>
	&quot;I&#39;d dress my mother so grand and gay,<br />
	And the baby should have a new toy each day.</p>
<p>
	&quot;And I&#39;d feed the hungry and clothe the poor,<br />
	And all should bless me who left our door.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The Judge looked back as he climbed the hill,<br />
	And saw Maud Muller standing still.</p>
<p>
	&quot;A form more fair, a face more sweet,<br />
	Ne&#39;er hath it been my lot to meet.</p>
<p>
	&quot;And her modest answer and graceful air<br />
	Show her wise and good as she is fair.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Would she were mine, and I to-day,<br />
	Like her, a harvester of hay:</p>
<p>
	&quot;No doubtful balance of rights and wrongs,<br />
	Nor weary lawyers with endless tongues,</p>
<p>
	&quot;But low of cattle, and song of birds,<br />
	And health, and quiet, and loving words.&quot;</p>
<p>
	But he thought of his sisters, proud and cold,<br />
	And his mother, vain of her rank and gold.</p>
<p>
	So, closing his heart, the Judge rode on,<br />
	And Maud was left in the field alone.</p>
<p>
	But the lawyers smiled that afternoon,<br />
	When he hummed in court an old love-tune;</p>
<p>
	And the young girl mused beside the well,<br />
	Till the rain on the unraked clover fell.</p>
<p>
	He wedded a wife of richest dower,<br />
	Who lived for fashion, as he for power.</p>
<p>
	Yet oft, in his marble hearth&#39;s bright glow,<br />
	He watched a picture come and go:</p>
<p>
	And sweet Maud Muller&#39;s hazel eyes<br />
	Looked out in their innocent surprise.</p>
<p>
	Oft when the wine in his glass was red,<br />
	He longed for the wayside well instead;</p>
<p>
	And closed his eyes on his garnished rooms,<br />
	To dream of meadows and clover-blooms.</p>
<p>
	And the proud man sighed, with a secret pain,<br />
	&quot;Ah, that I were free again!</p>
<p>
	&quot;Free as when I rode that day,<br />
	Where the barefoot maiden raked her hay.&quot;</p>
<p>
	She wedded a man unlearned and poor,<br />
	And many children played round her door.</p>
<p>
	But care and sorrow, and child-birth pain,<br />
	Left their traces on heart and brain.</p>
<p>
	And oft, when the summer sun shone hot<br />
	On the new-mown hay in the meadow lot,</p>
<p>
	And she heard the little spring brook fall<br />
	Over the roadside, through the wall,</p>
<p>
	In the shade of the apple-tree again<br />
	She saw a rider draw his rein,</p>
<p>
	And, gazing down with timid grace,<br />
	She felt his pleased eyes read her face.</p>
<p>
	Sometimes her narrow kitchen walls<br />
	Stretched away into stately halls;</p>
<p>
	The weary wheel to a spinnet turned,<br />
	The tallow candle an astral burned;</p>
<p>
	And for him who sat by the chimney lug,<br />
	Dozing and grumbling o&#39;er pipe and mug,</p>
<p>
	A manly form at her side she saw,<br />
	And joy was duty and love was law.</p>
<p>
	Then she took up her burden of life again,<br />
	Saying only, &quot;It might have been.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Alas for maiden, alas for Judge,<br />
	For rich repiner and household drudge!</p>
<p>
	God pity them both! and pity us all,<br />
	Who vainly the dreams of youth recall;</p>
<p>
	For of all sad words of tongue or pen,<br />
	The saddest are these: &quot;It might have been!&quot;</p>
<p>
	Ah, well! for us all some sweet hope lies<br />
	Deeply buried from human eyes;</p>
<p>
	And, in the hereafter, angels may<br />
	Roll the stone from its grave away!</p>
