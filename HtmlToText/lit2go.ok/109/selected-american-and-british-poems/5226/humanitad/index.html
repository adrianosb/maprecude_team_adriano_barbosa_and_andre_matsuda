                <p>
	It is full winter now: the trees are bare,<br />
	Save where the cattle huddle from the cold<br />
	Beneath the pine, for it doth never wear<br />
	The autumn&#39;s gaudy livery whose gold<br />
	Her jealous brother pilfers, but is true<br />
	To the green doublet; bitter is the wind, as though it blew</p>
<p>
	From Saturn&#39;s cave; a few thin wisps of hay<br />
	Lie on the sharp black hedges, where the wain<br />
	Dragged the sweet pillage of a summer&#39;s day<br />
	From the low meadows up the narrow lane;<br />
	Upon the half-thawed snow the bleating sheep<br />
	Press close against the hurdles, and the shivering house-dogs creep</p>
<p>
	From the shut stable to the frozen stream<br />
	And back again disconsolate, and miss<br />
	The bawling shepherds and the noisy team;<br />
	And overhead in circling listlessness<br />
	The cawing rooks whirl round the frosted stack,<br />
	Or crowd the dripping boughs; and in the fen the ice-pools crack</p>
<p>
	Where the gaunt bittern stalks among the reeds<br />
	And flaps his wings, and stretches back his neck,<br />
	And hoots to see the moon; across the meads<br />
	Limps the poor frightened hare, a little speck;<br />
	And a stray seamew with its fretful cry<br />
	Flits like a sudden drift of snow against the dull grey sky.</p>
<p>
	Full winter: and the lusty goodman brings<br />
	His load of faggots from the chilly byre,<br />
	And stamps his feet upon the hearth, and flings<br />
	The sappy billets on the waning fire,<br />
	And laughs to see the sudden lightening scare<br />
	His children at their play, and yet, - the spring is in the air;</p>
<p>
	Already the slim crocus stirs the snow,<br />
	And soon yon blanched fields will bloom again<br />
	With nodding cowslips for some lad to mow,<br />
	For with the first warm kisses of the rain<br />
	The winter&#39;s icy sorrow breaks to tears,<br />
	And the brown thrushes mate, and with bright eyes the rabbit peers</p>
<p>
	From the dark warren where the fir-cones lie,<br />
	And treads one snowdrop under foot, and runs<br />
	Over the mossy knoll, and blackbirds fly<br />
	Across our path at evening, and the suns<br />
	Stay longer with us; ah! how good to see<br />
	Grass-girdled spring in all her joy of laughing greenery</p>
<p>
	Dance through the hedges till the early rose,<br />
	(That sweet repentance of the thorny briar!)<br />
	Burst from its sheathed emerald and disclose<br />
	The little quivering disk of golden fire<br />
	Which the bees know so well, for with it come<br />
	Pale boy&#39;s-love, sops-in-wine, and daffadillies all in bloom.</p>
<p>
	Then up and down the field the sower goes,<br />
	While close behind the laughing younker scares<br />
	With shrilly whoop the black and thievish crows,<br />
	And then the chestnut-tree its glory wears,<br />
	And on the grass the creamy blossom falls<br />
	In odorous excess, and faint half-whispered madrigals</p>
<p>
	Steal from the bluebells&#39; nodding carillons<br />
	Each breezy morn, and then white jessamine,<br />
	That star of its own heaven, snap-dragons<br />
	With lolling crimson tongues, and eglantine<br />
	In dusty velvets clad usurp the bed<br />
	And woodland empery, and when the lingering rose hath shed</p>
<p>
	Red leaf by leaf its folded panoply,<br />
	And pansies closed their purple-lidded eyes,<br />
	Chrysanthemums from gilded argosy<br />
	Unload their gaudy scentless merchandise,<br />
	And violets getting overbold withdraw<br />
	From their shy nooks, and scarlet berries dot the leafless haw.</p>
<p>
	O happy field! and O thrice happy tree!<br />
	Soon will your queen in daisy-flowered smock<br />
	And crown of flower-de-luce trip down the lea,<br />
	Soon will the lazy shepherds drive their flock<br />
	Back to the pasture by the pool, and soon<br />
	Through the green leaves will float the hum of murmuring bees at<br />
	noon.</p>
<p>
	Soon will the glade be bright with bellamour,<br />
	The flower which wantons love, and those sweet nuns<br />
	Vale-lilies in their snowy vestiture<br />
	Will tell their beaded pearls, and carnations<br />
	With mitred dusky leaves will scent the wind,<br />
	And straggling traveller&#39;s-joy each hedge with yellow stars will<br />
	bind.</p>
<p>
	Dear bride of Nature and most bounteous spring,<br />
	That canst give increase to the sweet-breath&#39;d kine,<br />
	And to the kid its little horns, and bring<br />
	The soft and silky blossoms to the vine,<br />
	Where is that old nepenthe which of yore<br />
	Man got from poppy root and glossy-berried mandragore!</p>
<p>
	There was a time when any common bird<br />
	Could make me sing in unison, a time<br />
	When all the strings of boyish life were stirred<br />
	To quick response or more melodious rhyme<br />
	By every forest idyll; - do I change?<br />
	Or rather doth some evil thing through thy fair pleasaunce range?</p>
<p>
	Nay, nay, thou art the same: &#39;tis I who seek<br />
	To vex with sighs thy simple solitude,<br />
	And because fruitless tears bedew my cheek<br />
	Would have thee weep with me in brotherhood;<br />
	Fool! shall each wronged and restless spirit dare<br />
	To taint such wine with the salt poison of own despair!</p>
<p>
	Thou art the same: &#39;tis I whose wretched soul<br />
	Takes discontent to be its paramour,<br />
	And gives its kingdom to the rude control<br />
	Of what should be its servitor, - for sure<br />
	Wisdom is somewhere, though the stormy sea<br />
	Contain it not, and the huge deep answer &#39;&#39;Tis not in me.&#39;</p>
<p>
	To burn with one clear flame, to stand erect<br />
	In natural honour, not to bend the knee<br />
	In profitless prostrations whose effect<br />
	Is by itself condemned, what alchemy<br />
	Can teach me this? what herb Medea brewed<br />
	Will bring the unexultant peace of essence not subdued?</p>
<p>
	The minor chord which ends the harmony,<br />
	And for its answering brother waits in vain<br />
	Sobbing for incompleted melody,<br />
	Dies a swan&#39;s death; but I the heir of pain,<br />
	A silent Memnon with blank lidless eyes,<br />
	Wait for the light and music of those suns which never rise.</p>
<p>
	The quenched-out torch, the lonely cypress-gloom,<br />
	The little dust stored in the narrow urn,<br />
	The gentle XAIPE of the Attic tomb, -<br />
	Were not these better far than to return<br />
	To my old fitful restless malady,<br />
	Or spend my days within the voiceless cave of misery?</p>
<p>
	Nay! for perchance that poppy-crowned god<br />
	Is like the watcher by a sick man&#39;s bed<br />
	Who talks of sleep but gives it not; his rod<br />
	Hath lost its virtue, and, when all is said,<br />
	Death is too rude, too obvious a key<br />
	To solve one single secret in a life&#39;s philosophy.</p>
<p>
	And Love! that noble madness, whose august<br />
	And inextinguishable might can slay<br />
	The soul with honeyed drugs, - alas! I must<br />
	From such sweet ruin play the runaway,<br />
	Although too constant memory never can<br />
	Forget the arched splendour of those brows Olympian</p>
<p>
	Which for a little season made my youth<br />
	So soft a swoon of exquisite indolence<br />
	That all the chiding of more prudent Truth<br />
	Seemed the thin voice of jealousy, - O hence<br />
	Thou huntress deadlier than Artemis!<br />
	Go seek some other quarry! for of thy too perilous bliss.</p>
<p>
	My lips have drunk enough, - no more, no more, -<br />
	Though Love himself should turn his gilded prow<br />
	Back to the troubled waters of this shore<br />
	Where I am wrecked and stranded, even now<br />
	The chariot wheels of passion sweep too near,<br />
	Hence! Hence! I pass unto a life more barren, more austere.</p>
<p>
	More barren - ay, those arms will never lean<br />
	Down through the trellised vines and draw my soul<br />
	In sweet reluctance through the tangled green;<br />
	Some other head must wear that aureole,<br />
	For I am hers who loves not any man<br />
	Whose white and stainless bosom bears the sign Gorgonian.</p>
<p>
	Let Venus go and chuck her dainty page,<br />
	And kiss his mouth, and toss his curly hair,<br />
	With net and spear and hunting equipage<br />
	Let young Adonis to his tryst repair,<br />
	But me her fond and subtle-fashioned spell<br />
	Delights no more, though I could win her dearest citadel.</p>
<p>
	Ay, though I were that laughing shepherd boy<br />
	Who from Mount Ida saw the little cloud<br />
	Pass over Tenedos and lofty Troy<br />
	And knew the coming of the Queen, and bowed<br />
	In wonder at her feet, not for the sake<br />
	Of a new Helen would I bid her hand the apple take.</p>
<p>
	Then rise supreme Athena argent-limbed!<br />
	And, if my lips be musicless, inspire<br />
	At least my life: was not thy glory hymned<br />
	By One who gave to thee his sword and lyre<br />
	Like AEschylos at well-fought Marathon,<br />
	And died to show that Milton&#39;s England still could bear a son!</p>
<p>
	And yet I cannot tread the Portico<br />
	And live without desire, fear and pain,<br />
	Or nurture that wise calm which long ago<br />
	The grave Athenian master taught to men,<br />
	Self-poised, self-centred, and self-comforted,<br />
	To watch the world&#39;s vain phantasies go by with unbowed head.</p>
<p>
	Alas! that serene brow, those eloquent lips,<br />
	Those eyes that mirrored all eternity,<br />
	Rest in their own Colonos, an eclipse<br />
	Hath come on Wisdom, and Mnemosyne<br />
	Is childless; in the night which she had made<br />
	For lofty secure flight Athena&#39;s owl itself hath strayed.</p>
<p>
	Nor much with Science do I care to climb,<br />
	Although by strange and subtle witchery<br />
	She drew the moon from heaven: the Muse Time<br />
	Unrolls her gorgeous-coloured tapestry<br />
	To no less eager eyes; often indeed<br />
	In the great epic of Polymnia&#39;s scroll I love to read</p>
<p>
	How Asia sent her myriad hosts to war<br />
	Against a little town, and panoplied<br />
	In gilded mail with jewelled scimitar,<br />
	White-shielded, purple-crested, rode the Mede<br />
	Between the waving poplars and the sea<br />
	Which men call Artemisium, till he saw Thermopylae</p>
<p>
	Its steep ravine spanned by a narrow wall,<br />
	And on the nearer side a little brood<br />
	Of careless lions holding festival!<br />
	And stood amazed at such hardihood,<br />
	And pitched his tent upon the reedy shore,<br />
	And stayed two days to wonder, and then crept at midnight o&#39;er</p>
<p>
	Some unfrequented height, and coming down<br />
	The autumn forests treacherously slew<br />
	What Sparta held most dear and was the crown<br />
	Of far Eurotas, and passed on, nor knew<br />
	How God had staked an evil net for him<br />
	In the small bay at Salamis, - and yet, the page grows dim,</p>
<p>
	Its cadenced Greek delights me not, I feel<br />
	With such a goodly time too out of tune<br />
	To love it much: for like the Dial&#39;s wheel<br />
	That from its blinded darkness strikes the noon<br />
	Yet never sees the sun, so do my eyes<br />
	Restlessly follow that which from my cheated vision flies.</p>
<p>
	O for one grand unselfish simple life<br />
	To teach us what is Wisdom! speak ye hills<br />
	Of lone Helvellyn, for this note of strife<br />
	Shunned your untroubled crags and crystal rills,<br />
	Where is that Spirit which living blamelessly<br />
	Yet dared to kiss the smitten mouth of his own century!</p>
<p>
	Speak ye Rydalian laurels! where is he<br />
	Whose gentle head ye sheltered, that pure soul<br />
	Whose gracious days of uncrowned majesty<br />
	Through lowliest conduct touched the lofty goal<br />
	Where love and duty mingle! Him at least<br />
	The most high Laws were glad of, he had sat at Wisdom&#39;s feast;</p>
<p>
	But we are Learning&#39;s changelings, know by rote<br />
	The clarion watchword of each Grecian school<br />
	And follow none, the flawless sword which smote<br />
	The pagan Hydra is an effete tool<br />
	Which we ourselves have blunted, what man now<br />
	Shall scale the august ancient heights and to old Reverence bow?</p>
<p>
	One such indeed I saw, but, Ichabod!<br />
	Gone is that last dear son of Italy,<br />
	Who being man died for the sake of God,<br />
	And whose unrisen bones sleep peacefully,<br />
	O guard him, guard him well, my Giotto&#39;s tower,<br />
	Thou marble lily of the lily town! let not the lour</p>
<p>
	Of the rude tempest vex his slumber, or<br />
	The Arno with its tawny troubled gold<br />
	O&#39;er-leap its marge, no mightier conqueror<br />
	Clomb the high Capitol in the days of old<br />
	When Rome was indeed Rome, for Liberty<br />
	Walked like a bride beside him, at which sight pale Mystery</p>
<p>
	Fled shrieking to her farthest sombrest cell<br />
	With an old man who grabbled rusty keys,<br />
	Fled shuddering, for that immemorial knell<br />
	With which oblivion buries dynasties<br />
	Swept like a wounded eagle on the blast,<br />
	As to the holy heart of Rome the great triumvir passed.</p>
<p>
	He knew the holiest heart and heights of Rome,<br />
	He drave the base wolf from the lion&#39;s lair,<br />
	And now lies dead by that empyreal dome<br />
	Which overtops Valdarno hung in air<br />
	By Brunelleschi - O Melpomene<br />
	Breathe through thy melancholy pipe thy sweetest threnody!</p>
<p>
	Breathe through the tragic stops such melodies<br />
	That Joy&#39;s self may grow jealous, and the Nine<br />
	Forget awhile their discreet emperies,<br />
	Mourning for him who on Rome&#39;s lordliest shrine<br />
	Lit for men&#39;s lives the light of Marathon,<br />
	And bare to sun-forgotten fields the fire of the sun!</p>
<p>
	O guard him, guard him well, my Giotto&#39;s tower!<br />
	Let some young Florentine each eventide<br />
	Bring coronals of that enchanted flower<br />
	Which the dim woods of Vallombrosa hide,<br />
	And deck the marble tomb wherein he lies<br />
	Whose soul is as some mighty orb unseen of mortal eyes;</p>
<p>
	Some mighty orb whose cycled wanderings,<br />
	Being tempest-driven to the farthest rim<br />
	Where Chaos meets Creation and the wings<br />
	Of the eternal chanting Cherubim<br />
	Are pavilioned on Nothing, passed away<br />
	Into a moonless void, - and yet, though he is dust and clay,</p>
<p>
	He is not dead, the immemorial Fates<br />
	Forbid it, and the closing shears refrain.<br />
	Lift up your heads ye everlasting gates!<br />
	Ye argent clarions, sound a loftier strain<br />
	For the vile thing he hated lurks within<br />
	Its sombre house, alone with God and memories of sin.</p>
<p>
	Still what avails it that she sought her cave<br />
	That murderous mother of red harlotries?<br />
	At Munich on the marble architrave<br />
	The Grecian boys die smiling, but the seas<br />
	Which wash AEgina fret in loneliness<br />
	Not mirroring their beauty; so our lives grow colourless</p>
<p>
	For lack of our ideals, if one star<br />
	Flame torch-like in the heavens the unjust<br />
	Swift daylight kills it, and no trump of war<br />
	Can wake to passionate voice the silent dust<br />
	Which was Mazzini once! rich Niobe<br />
	For all her stony sorrows hath her sons; but Italy,</p>
<p>
	What Easter Day shall make her children rise,<br />
	Who were not Gods yet suffered? what sure feet<br />
	Shall find their grave-clothes folded? what clear eyes<br />
	Shall see them bodily? O it were meet<br />
	To roll the stone from off the sepulchre<br />
	And kiss the bleeding roses of their wounds, in love of her,</p>
<p>
	Our Italy! our mother visible!<br />
	Most blessed among nations and most sad,<br />
	For whose dear sake the young Calabrian fell<br />
	That day at Aspromonte and was glad<br />
	That in an age when God was bought and sold<br />
	One man could die for Liberty! but we, burnt out and cold,</p>
<p>
	See Honour smitten on the cheek and gyves<br />
	Bind the sweet feet of Mercy: Poverty<br />
	Creeps through our sunless lanes and with sharp knives<br />
	Cuts the warm throats of children stealthily,<br />
	And no word said:- O we are wretched men<br />
	Unworthy of our great inheritance! where is the pen</p>
<p>
	Of austere Milton? where the mighty sword<br />
	Which slew its master righteously? the years<br />
	Have lost their ancient leader, and no word<br />
	Breaks from the voiceless tripod on our ears:<br />
	While as a ruined mother in some spasm<br />
	Bears a base child and loathes it, so our best enthusiasm</p>
<p>
	Genders unlawful children, Anarchy<br />
	Freedom&#39;s own Judas, the vile prodigal<br />
	Licence who steals the gold of Liberty<br />
	And yet has nothing, Ignorance the real<br />
	One Fraticide since Cain, Envy the asp<br />
	That stings itself to anguish, Avarice whose palsied grasp</p>
<p>
	Is in its extent stiffened, moneyed Greed<br />
	For whose dull appetite men waste away<br />
	Amid the whirr of wheels and are the seed<br />
	Of things which slay their sower, these each day<br />
	Sees rife in England, and the gentle feet<br />
	Of Beauty tread no more the stones of each unlovely street.</p>
<p>
	What even Cromwell spared is desecrated<br />
	By weed and worm, left to the stormy play<br />
	Of wind and beating snow, or renovated<br />
	By more destructful hands: Time&#39;s worst decay<br />
	Will wreathe its ruins with some loveliness,<br />
	But these new Vandals can but make a rain-proof barrenness.</p>
<p>
	Where is that Art which bade the Angels sing<br />
	Through Lincoln&#39;s lofty choir, till the air<br />
	Seems from such marble harmonies to ring<br />
	With sweeter song than common lips can dare<br />
	To draw from actual reed? ah! where is now<br />
	The cunning hand which made the flowering hawthorn branches bow</p>
<p>
	For Southwell&#39;s arch, and carved the House of One<br />
	Who loved the lilies of the field with all<br />
	Our dearest English flowers? the same sun<br />
	Rises for us: the seasons natural<br />
	Weave the same tapestry of green and grey:<br />
	The unchanged hills are with us: but that Spirit hath passed away.</p>
<p>
	And yet perchance it may be better so,<br />
	For Tyranny is an incestuous Queen,<br />
	Murder her brother is her bedfellow,<br />
	And the Plague chambers with her: in obscene<br />
	And bloody paths her treacherous feet are set;<br />
	Better the empty desert and a soul inviolate!</p>
<p>
	For gentle brotherhood, the harmony<br />
	Of living in the healthful air, the swift<br />
	Clean beauty of strong limbs when men are free<br />
	And women chaste, these are the things which lift<br />
	Our souls up more than even Agnolo&#39;s<br />
	Gaunt blinded Sibyl poring o&#39;er the scroll of human woes,</p>
<p>
	Or Titian&#39;s little maiden on the stair<br />
	White as her own sweet lily and as tall,<br />
	Or Mona Lisa smiling through her hair, -<br />
	Ah! somehow life is bigger after all<br />
	Than any painted angel, could we see<br />
	The God that is within us! The old Greek serenity</p>
<p>
	Which curbs the passion of that level line<br />
	Of marble youths, who with untroubled eyes<br />
	And chastened limbs ride round Athena&#39;s shrine<br />
	And mirror her divine economies,<br />
	And balanced symmetry of what in man<br />
	Would else wage ceaseless warfare, - this at least within the span</p>
<p>
	Between our mother&#39;s kisses and the grave<br />
	Might so inform our lives, that we could win<br />
	Such mighty empires that from her cave<br />
	Temptation would grow hoarse, and pallid Sin<br />
	Would walk ashamed of his adulteries,<br />
	And Passion creep from out the House of Lust with startled eyes.</p>
<p>
	To make the body and the spirit one<br />
	With all right things, till no thing live in vain<br />
	From morn to noon, but in sweet unison<br />
	With every pulse of flesh and throb of brain<br />
	The soul in flawless essence high enthroned,<br />
	Against all outer vain attack invincibly bastioned,</p>
<p>
	Mark with serene impartiality<br />
	The strife of things, and yet be comforted,<br />
	Knowing that by the chain causality<br />
	All separate existences are wed<br />
	Into one supreme whole, whose utterance<br />
	Is joy, or holier praise! ah! surely this were governance</p>
<p>
	Of Life in most august omnipresence,<br />
	Through which the rational intellect would find<br />
	In passion its expression, and mere sense,<br />
	Ignoble else, lend fire to the mind,<br />
	And being joined with it in harmony<br />
	More mystical than that which binds the stars planetary,</p>
<p>
	Strike from their several tones one octave chord<br />
	Whose cadence being measureless would fly<br />
	Through all the circling spheres, then to its Lord<br />
	Return refreshed with its new empery<br />
	And more exultant power, - this indeed<br />
	Could we but reach it were to find the last, the perfect creed.</p>
<p>
	Ah! it was easy when the world was young<br />
	To keep one&#39;s life free and inviolate,<br />
	From our sad lips another song is rung,<br />
	By our own hands our heads are desecrate,<br />
	Wanderers in drear exile, and dispossessed<br />
	Of what should be our own, we can but feed on wild unrest.</p>
<p>
	Somehow the grace, the bloom of things has flown,<br />
	And of all men we are most wretched who<br />
	Must live each other&#39;s lives and not our own<br />
	For very pity&#39;s sake and then undo<br />
	All that we lived for - it was otherwise<br />
	When soul and body seemed to blend in mystic symphonies.</p>
<p>
	But we have left those gentle haunts to pass<br />
	With weary feet to the new Calvary,<br />
	Where we behold, as one who in a glass<br />
	Sees his own face, self-slain Humanity,<br />
	And in the dumb reproach of that sad gaze<br />
	Learn what an awful phantom the red hand of man can raise.</p>
<p>
	O smitten mouth! O forehead crowned with thorn!<br />
	O chalice of all common miseries!<br />
	Thou for our sakes that loved thee not hast borne<br />
	An agony of endless centuries,<br />
	And we were vain and ignorant nor knew<br />
	That when we stabbed thy heart it was our own real hearts we slew.</p>
<p>
	Being ourselves the sowers and the seeds,<br />
	The night that covers and the lights that fade,<br />
	The spear that pierces and the side that bleeds,<br />
	The lips betraying and the life betrayed;<br />
	The deep hath calm: the moon hath rest: but we<br />
	Lords of the natural world are yet our own dread enemy.</p>
<p>
	Is this the end of all that primal force<br />
	Which, in its changes being still the same,<br />
	From eyeless Chaos cleft its upward course,<br />
	Through ravenous seas and whirling rocks and flame,<br />
	Till the suns met in heaven and began<br />
	Their cycles, and the morning stars sang, and the Word was Man!</p>
<p>
	Nay, nay, we are but crucified, and though<br />
	The bloody sweat falls from our brows like rain<br />
	Loosen the nails - we shall come down I know,<br />
	Staunch the red wounds - we shall be whole again,<br />
	No need have we of hyssop-laden rod,<br />
	That which is purely human, that is godlike, that is God.</p>
