                <p>
	I.<br />
	He did not wear his scarlet coat,<br />
	For blood and wine are red,<br />
	And blood and wine were on his hands<br />
	When they found him with the dead,<br />
	The poor dead woman whom he loved,<br />
	And murdered in her bed.</p>
<p>
	He walked amongst the Trial Men<br />
	In a suit of shabby grey;<br />
	A cricket cap was on his head,<br />
	And his step seemed light and gay;<br />
	But I never saw a man who looked<br />
	So wistfully at the day.</p>
<p>
	I never saw a man who looked<br />
	With such a wistful eye<br />
	Upon that little tent of blue<br />
	Which prisoners call the sky,<br />
	And at every drifting cloud that went<br />
	With sails of silver by.</p>
<p>
	I walked, with other souls in pain,<br />
	Within another ring,<br />
	And was wondering if the man had done<br />
	A great or little thing,<br />
	When a voice behind me whispered low,<br />
	&quot;That fellow&#39;s got to swing.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Dear Christ! the very prison walls<br />
	Suddenly seemed to reel,<br />
	And the sky above my head became<br />
	Like a casque of scorching steel;<br />
	And, though I was a soul in pain,<br />
	My pain I could not feel.</p>
<p>
	I only knew what hunted thought<br />
	Quickened his step, and why<br />
	He looked upon the garish day<br />
	With such a wistful eye;<br />
	The man had killed the thing he loved<br />
	And so he had to die.</p>
<p>
	Yet each man kills the thing he loves<br />
	By each let this be heard,<br />
	Some do it with a bitter look,<br />
	Some with a flattering word,<br />
	The coward does it with a kiss,<br />
	The brave man with a sword!</p>
<p>
	Some kill their love when they are young,<br />
	And some when they are old;<br />
	Some strangle with the hands of Lust,<br />
	Some with the hands of Gold:<br />
	The kindest use a knife, because<br />
	The dead so soon grow cold.</p>
<p>
	Some love too little, some too long,<br />
	Some sell, and others buy;<br />
	Some do the deed with many tears,<br />
	And some without a sigh:<br />
	For each man kills the thing he loves,<br />
	Yet each man does not die.</p>
<p>
	He does not die a death of shame<br />
	On a day of dark disgrace,<br />
	Nor have a noose about his neck,<br />
	Nor a cloth upon his face,<br />
	Nor drop feet foremost through the floor<br />
	Into an empty place</p>
<p>
	He does not sit with silent men<br />
	Who watch him night and day;<br />
	Who watch him when he tries to weep,<br />
	And when he tries to pray;<br />
	Who watch him lest himself should rob<br />
	The prison of its prey.</p>
<p>
	He does not wake at dawn to see<br />
	Dread figures throng his room,<br />
	The shivering Chaplain robed in white,<br />
	The Sheriff stern with gloom,<br />
	And the Governor all in shiny black,<br />
	With the yellow face of Doom.</p>
<p>
	He does not rise in piteous haste<br />
	To put on convict-clothes,<br />
	While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes<br />
	Each new and nerve-twitched pose,<br />
	Fingering a watch whose little ticks<br />
	Are like horrible hammer-blows.</p>
<p>
	He does not know that sickening thirst<br />
	That sands one&#39;s throat, before<br />
	The hangman with his gardener&#39;s gloves<br />
	Slips through the padded door,<br />
	And binds one with three leathern thongs,<br />
	That the throat may thirst no more.</p>
<p>
	He does not bend his head to hear<br />
	The Burial Office read,<br />
	Nor, while the terror of his soul<br />
	Tells him he is not dead,<br />
	Cross his own coffin, as he moves<br />
	Into the hideous shed.</p>
<p>
	He does not stare upon the air<br />
	Through a little roof of glass;<br />
	He does not pray with lips of clay<br />
	For his agony to pass;<br />
	Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek<br />
	The kiss of Caiaphas.</p>
<p>
	II.</p>
<p>
	Six weeks our guardsman walked the yard,<br />
	In a suit of shabby grey:<br />
	His cricket cap was on his head,<br />
	And his step seemed light and gay,<br />
	But I never saw a man who looked<br />
	So wistfully at the day.</p>
<p>
	I never saw a man who looked<br />
	With such a wistful eye<br />
	Upon that little tent of blue<br />
	Which prisoners call the sky,<br />
	And at every wandering cloud that trailed<br />
	Its raveled fleeces by.</p>
<p>
	He did not wring his hands, as do<br />
	Those witless men who dare<br />
	To try to rear the changeling Hope<br />
	In the cave of black Despair:<br />
	He only looked upon the sun,<br />
	And drank the morning air.</p>
<p>
	He did not wring his hands nor weep,<br />
	Nor did he peek or pine,<br />
	But he drank the air as though it held<br />
	Some healthful anodyne;<br />
	With open mouth he drank the sun<br />
	As though it had been wine!</p>
<p>
	And I and all the souls in pain,<br />
	Who tramped the other ring,<br />
	Forgot if we ourselves had done<br />
	A great or little thing,<br />
	And watched with gaze of dull amaze<br />
	The man who had to swing.</p>
<p>
	And strange it was to see him pass<br />
	With a step so light and gay,<br />
	And strange it was to see him look<br />
	So wistfully at the day,<br />
	And strange it was to think that he<br />
	Had such a debt to pay.</p>
<p>
	For oak and elm have pleasant leaves<br />
	That in the spring-time shoot:<br />
	But grim to see is the gallows-tree,<br />
	With its adder-bitten root,<br />
	And, green or dry, a man must die<br />
	Before it bears its fruit!</p>
<p>
	The loftiest place is that seat of grace<br />
	For which all worldlings try:<br />
	But who would stand in hempen band<br />
	Upon a scaffold high,<br />
	And through a murderer&#39;s collar take<br />
	His last look at the sky?</p>
<p>
	It is sweet to dance to violins<br />
	When Love and Life are fair:<br />
	To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes<br />
	Is delicate and rare:<br />
	But it is not sweet with nimble feet<br />
	To dance upon the air!</p>
<p>
	So with curious eyes and sick surmise<br />
	We watched him day by day,<br />
	And wondered if each one of us<br />
	Would end the self-same way,<br />
	For none can tell to what red Hell<br />
	His sightless soul may stray.</p>
<p>
	At last the dead man walked no more<br />
	Amongst the Trial Men,<br />
	And I knew that he was standing up<br />
	In the black dock&#39;s dreadful pen,<br />
	And that never would I see his face<br />
	In God&#39;s sweet world again.</p>
<p>
	Like two doomed ships that pass in storm<br />
	We had crossed each other&#39;s way:<br />
	But we made no sign, we said no word,<br />
	We had no word to say;<br />
	For we did not meet in the holy night,<br />
	But in the shameful day.</p>
<p>
	A prison wall was round us both,<br />
	Two outcast men were we:<br />
	The world had thrust us from its heart,<br />
	And God from out His care:<br />
	And the iron gin that waits for Sin<br />
	Had caught us in its snare.</p>
<p>
	In Debtors&#39; Yard the stones are hard,<br />
	And the dripping wall is high,<br />
	So it was there he took the air<br />
	Beneath the leaden sky,<br />
	And by each side a Warder walked,<br />
	For fear the man might die.</p>
<p>
	Or else he sat with those who watched<br />
	His anguish night and day;<br />
	Who watched him when he rose to weep,<br />
	And when he crouched to pray;<br />
	Who watched him lest himself should rob<br />
	Their scaffold of its prey.</p>
<p>
	The Governor was strong upon<br />
	The Regulations Act:<br />
	The Doctor said that Death was but<br />
	A scientific fact:<br />
	And twice a day the Chaplain called<br />
	And left a little tract.</p>
<p>
	And twice a day he smoked his pipe,<br />
	And drank his quart of beer:<br />
	His soul was resolute, and held<br />
	No hiding-place for fear;<br />
	He often said that he was glad<br />
	The hangman&#39;s hands were near.</p>
<p>
	But why he said so strange a thing<br />
	No Warder dared to ask:<br />
	For he to whom a watcher&#39;s doom<br />
	Is given as his task,<br />
	Must set a lock upon his lips,<br />
	And make his face a mask.</p>
<p>
	Or else he might be moved, and try<br />
	To comfort or console:<br />
	And what should Human Pity do<br />
	Pent up in Murderers&#39; Hole?<br />
	What word of grace in such a place<br />
	Could help a brother&#39;s soul?</p>
<p>
	With slouch and swing around the ring<br />
	We trod the Fool&#39;s Parade!<br />
	We did not care: we knew we were<br />
	The Devil&#39;s Own Brigade:<br />
	And shaven head and feet of lead<br />
	Make a merry masquerade.</p>
<p>
	We tore the tarry rope to shreds<br />
	With blunt and bleeding nails;<br />
	We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,<br />
	And cleaned the shining rails:<br />
	And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,<br />
	And clattered with the pails.</p>
<p>
	We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,<br />
	We turned the dusty drill:<br />
	We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,<br />
	And sweated on the mill:<br />
	But in the heart of every man<br />
	Terror was lying still.</p>
<p>
	So still it lay that every day<br />
	Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:<br />
	And we forgot the bitter lot<br />
	That waits for fool and knave,<br />
	Till once, as we tramped in from work,<br />
	We passed an open grave.</p>
<p>
	With yawning mouth the yellow hole<br />
	Gaped for a living thing;<br />
	The very mud cried out for blood<br />
	To the thirsty asphalte ring:<br />
	And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair<br />
	Some prisoner had to swing.</p>
<p>
	Right in we went, with soul intent<br />
	On Death and Dread and Doom:<br />
	The hangman, with his little bag,<br />
	Went shuffling through the gloom<br />
	And each man trembled as he crept<br />
	Into his numbered tomb.</p>
<p>
	That night the empty corridors<br />
	Were full of forms of Fear,<br />
	And up and down the iron town<br />
	Stole feet we could not hear,<br />
	And through the bars that hide the stars<br />
	White faces seemed to peer.</p>
<p>
	He lay as one who lies and dreams<br />
	In a pleasant meadow-land,<br />
	The watcher watched him as he slept,<br />
	And could not understand<br />
	How one could sleep so sweet a sleep<br />
	With a hangman close at hand?</p>
<p>
	But there is no sleep when men must weep<br />
	Who never yet have wept:<br />
	So we&mdash;the fool, the fraud, the knave&mdash;<br />
	That endless vigil kept,<br />
	And through each brain on hands of pain<br />
	Another&#39;s terror crept.</p>
<p>
	Alas! it is a fearful thing<br />
	To feel another&#39;s guilt!<br />
	For, right within, the sword of Sin<br />
	Pierced to its poisoned hilt,<br />
	And as molten lead were the tears we shed<br />
	For the blood we had not spilt.</p>
<p>
	The Warders with their shoes of felt<br />
	Crept by each padlocked door,<br />
	And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,<br />
	Grey figures on the floor,<br />
	And wondered why men knelt to pray<br />
	Who never prayed before.</p>
<p>
	All through the night we knelt and prayed,<br />
	Mad mourners of a corpse!<br />
	The troubled plumes of midnight were<br />
	The plumes upon a hearse:<br />
	And bitter wine upon a sponge<br />
	Was the savior of Remorse.</p>
<p>
	The cock crew, the red cock crew,<br />
	But never came the day:<br />
	And crooked shape of Terror crouched,<br />
	In the corners where we lay:<br />
	And each evil sprite that walks by night<br />
	Before us seemed to play.</p>
<p>
	They glided past, they glided fast,<br />
	Like travelers through a mist:<br />
	They mocked the moon in a rigadoon<br />
	Of delicate turn and twist,<br />
	And with formal pace and loathsome grace<br />
	The phantoms kept their tryst.</p>
<p>
	With mop and mow, we saw them go,<br />
	Slim shadows hand in hand:<br />
	About, about, in ghostly rout<br />
	They trod a saraband:<br />
	And the damned grotesques made arabesques,<br />
	Like the wind upon the sand!</p>
<p>
	With the pirouettes of marionettes,<br />
	They tripped on pointed tread:<br />
	But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,<br />
	As their grisly masque they led,<br />
	And loud they sang, and loud they sang,<br />
	For they sang to wake the dead.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Oho!&quot; they cried, &quot;The world is wide,<br />
	But fettered limbs go lame!<br />
	And once, or twice, to throw the dice<br />
	Is a gentlemanly game,<br />
	But he does not win who plays with Sin<br />
	In the secret House of Shame.&quot;<br />
	No things of air these antics were<br />
	That frolicked with such glee:<br />
	To men whose lives were held in gyves,<br />
	And whose feet might not go free,<br />
	Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,<br />
	Most terrible to see.<br />
	Around, around, they waltzed and wound;<br />
	Some wheeled in smirking pairs:<br />
	With the mincing step of demirep<br />
	Some sidled up the stairs:<br />
	And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,<br />
	Each helped us at our prayers.</p>
<p>
	The morning wind began to moan,<br />
	But still the night went on:<br />
	Through its giant loom the web of gloom<br />
	Crept till each thread was spun:<br />
	And, as we prayed, we grew afraid<br />
	Of the Justice of the Sun.</p>
<p>
	The moaning wind went wandering round<br />
	The weeping prison-wall:<br />
	Till like a wheel of turning-steel<br />
	We felt the minutes crawl:<br />
	O moaning wind! what had we done<br />
	To have such a seneschal?</p>
<p>
	At last I saw the shadowed bars<br />
	Like a lattice wrought in lead,<br />
	Move right across the whitewashed wall<br />
	That faced my three-plank bed,<br />
	And I knew that somewhere in the world<br />
	God&#39;s dreadful dawn was red.</p>
<p>
	At six o&#39;clock we cleaned our cells,<br />
	At seven all was still,<br />
	But the sough and swing of a mighty wing<br />
	The prison seemed to fill,<br />
	For the Lord of Death with icy breath<br />
	Had entered in to kill.</p>
<p>
	He did not pass in purple pomp,<br />
	Nor ride a moon-white steed.<br />
	Three yards of cord and a sliding board<br />
	Are all the gallows&#39; need:<br />
	So with rope of shame the Herald came<br />
	To do the secret deed.</p>
<p>
	We were as men who through a fen<br />
	Of filthy darkness grope:<br />
	We did not dare to breathe a prayer,<br />
	Or give our anguish scope:<br />
	Something was dead in each of us,<br />
	And what was dead was Hope.</p>
<p>
	For Man&#39;s grim Justice goes its way,<br />
	And will not swerve aside:<br />
	It slays the weak, it slays the strong,<br />
	It has a deadly stride:<br />
	With iron heel it slays the strong,<br />
	The monstrous parricide!</p>
<p>
	We waited for the stroke of eight:<br />
	Each tongue was thick with thirst:<br />
	For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate<br />
	That makes a man accursed,<br />
	And Fate will use a running noose<br />
	For the best man and the worst.</p>
<p>
	We had no other thing to do,<br />
	Save to wait for the sign to come:<br />
	So, like things of stone in a valley lone,<br />
	Quiet we sat and dumb:<br />
	But each man&#39;s heart beat thick and quick<br />
	Like a madman on a drum!</p>
<p>
	With sudden shock the prison-clock<br />
	Smote on the shivering air,<br />
	And from all the gaol rose up a wail<br />
	Of impotent despair,<br />
	Like the sound that frightened marshes hear<br />
	From a leper in his lair.</p>
<p>
	And as one sees most fearful things<br />
	In the crystal of a dream,<br />
	We saw the greasy hempen rope<br />
	Hooked to the blackened beam,<br />
	And heard the prayer the hangman&#39;s snare<br />
	Strangled into a scream.</p>
<p>
	And all the woe that moved him so<br />
	That he gave that bitter cry,<br />
	And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,<br />
	None knew so well as I:<br />
	For he who live more lives than one<br />
	More deaths than one must die.</p>
<p>
	IV.</p>
<p>
	There is no chapel on the day<br />
	On which they hang a man:<br />
	The Chaplain&#39;s heart is far too sick,<br />
	Or his face is far to wan,<br />
	Or there is that written in his eyes<br />
	Which none should look upon.</p>
<p>
	So they kept us close till nigh on noon,<br />
	And then they rang the bell,<br />
	And the Warders with their jingling keys<br />
	Opened each listening cell,<br />
	And down the iron stair we tramped,<br />
	Each from his separate Hell.</p>
<p>
	Out into God&#39;s sweet air we went,<br />
	But not in wonted way,<br />
	For this man&#39;s face was white with fear,<br />
	And that man&#39;s face was grey,<br />
	And I never saw sad men who looked<br />
	So wistfully at the day.</p>
<p>
	I never saw sad men who looked<br />
	With such a wistful eye<br />
	Upon that little tent of blue<br />
	We prisoners called the sky,<br />
	And at every careless cloud that passed<br />
	In happy freedom by.</p>
<p>
	But their were those amongst us all<br />
	Who walked with downcast head,<br />
	And knew that, had each go his due,<br />
	They should have died instead:<br />
	He had but killed a thing that lived<br />
	Whilst they had killed the dead.</p>
<p>
	For he who sins a second time<br />
	Wakes a dead soul to pain,<br />
	And draws it from its spotted shroud,<br />
	And makes it bleed again,<br />
	And makes it bleed great gouts of blood<br />
	And makes it bleed in vain!</p>
<p>
	Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb<br />
	With crooked arrows starred,<br />
	Silently we went round and round<br />
	The slippery asphalte yard;<br />
	Silently we went round and round,<br />
	And no man spoke a word.</p>
<p>
	Silently we went round and round,<br />
	And through each hollow mind<br />
	The memory of dreadful things<br />
	Rushed like a dreadful wind,<br />
	An Horror stalked before each man,<br />
	And terror crept behind.</p>
<p>
	The Warders strutted up and down,<br />
	And kept their herd of brutes,<br />
	Their uniforms were spick and span,<br />
	And they wore their Sunday suits,<br />
	But we knew the work they had been at<br />
	By the quicklime on their boots.</p>
<p>
	For where a grave had opened wide,<br />
	There was no grave at all:<br />
	Only a stretch of mud and sand<br />
	By the hideous prison-wall,<br />
	And a little heap of burning lime,<br />
	That the man should have his pall.</p>
<p>
	For he has a pall, this wretched man,<br />
	Such as few men can claim:<br />
	Deep down below a prison-yard,<br />
	Naked for greater shame,<br />
	He lies, with fetters on each foot,<br />
	Wrapt in a sheet of flame!</p>
<p>
	And all the while the burning lime<br />
	Eats flesh and bone away,<br />
	It eats the brittle bone by night,<br />
	And the soft flesh by the day,<br />
	It eats the flesh and bones by turns,<br />
	But it eats the heart alway.</p>
<p>
	For three long years they will not sow<br />
	Or root or seedling there:<br />
	For three long years the unblessed spot<br />
	Will sterile be and bare,<br />
	And look upon the wondering sky<br />
	With unreproachful stare.</p>
<p>
	They think a murderer&#39;s heart would taint<br />
	Each simple seed they sow.<br />
	It is not true! God&#39;s kindly earth<br />
	Is kindlier than men know,<br />
	And the red rose would but blow more red,<br />
	The white rose whiter blow.</p>
<p>
	Out of his mouth a red, red rose!<br />
	Out of his heart a white!<br />
	For who can say by what strange way,<br />
	Christ brings his will to light,<br />
	Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore<br />
	Bloomed in the great Pope&#39;s sight?</p>
<p>
	But neither milk-white rose nor red<br />
	May bloom in prison air;<br />
	The shard, the pebble, and the flint,<br />
	Are what they give us there:<br />
	For flowers have been known to heal<br />
	A common man&#39;s despair.</p>
<p>
	So never will wine-red rose or white,<br />
	Petal by petal, fall<br />
	On that stretch of mud and sand that lies<br />
	By the hideous prison-wall,<br />
	To tell the men who tramp the yard<br />
	That God&#39;s Son died for all.</p>
<p>
	Yet though the hideous prison-wall<br />
	Still hems him round and round,<br />
	And a spirit man not walk by night<br />
	That is with fetters bound,<br />
	And a spirit may not weep that lies<br />
	In such unholy ground,</p>
<p>
	He is at peace&mdash;this wretched man&mdash;<br />
	At peace, or will be soon:<br />
	There is no thing to make him mad,<br />
	Nor does Terror walk at noon,<br />
	For the lampless Earth in which he lies<br />
	Has neither Sun nor Moon.</p>
<p>
	They hanged him as a beast is hanged:<br />
	They did not even toll<br />
	A requiem that might have brought<br />
	Rest to his startled soul,<br />
	But hurriedly they took him out,<br />
	And hid him in a hole.</p>
<p>
	They stripped him of his canvas clothes,<br />
	And gave him to the flies;<br />
	They mocked the swollen purple throat<br />
	And the stark and staring eyes:<br />
	And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud<br />
	In which their convict lies.</p>
<p>
	The Chaplain would not kneel to pray<br />
	By his dishonored grave:<br />
	Nor mark it with that blessed Cross<br />
	That Christ for sinners gave,<br />
	Because the man was one of those<br />
	Whom Christ came down to save.</p>
<p>
	Yet all is well; he has but passed<br />
	To Life&#39;s appointed bourne:<br />
	And alien tears will fill for him<br />
	Pity&#39;s long-broken urn,<br />
	For his mourner will be outcast men,<br />
	And outcasts always mourn.</p>
<p>
	V.</p>
<p>
	I know not whether Laws be right,<br />
	Or whether Laws be wrong;<br />
	All that we know who lie in goal<br />
	Is that the wall is strong;<br />
	And that each day is like a year,<br />
	A year whose days are long.</p>
<p>
	But this I know, that every Law<br />
	That men have made for Man,<br />
	Since first Man took his brother&#39;s life,<br />
	And the sad world began,<br />
	But straws the wheat and saves the chaff<br />
	With a most evil fan.</p>
<p>
	This too I know&mdash;and wise it were<br />
	If each could know the same&mdash;<br />
	That every prison that men build<br />
	Is built with bricks of shame,<br />
	And bound with bars lest Christ should see<br />
	How men their brothers maim.</p>
<p>
	With bars they blur the gracious moon,<br />
	And blind the goodly sun:<br />
	And they do well to hide their Hell,<br />
	For in it things are done<br />
	That Son of God nor son of Man<br />
	Ever should look upon!</p>
<p>
	The vilest deeds like poison weeds<br />
	Bloom well in prison-air:<br />
	It is only what is good in Man<br />
	That wastes and withers there:<br />
	Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,<br />
	And the Warder is Despair</p>
<p>
	For they starve the little frightened child<br />
	Till it weeps both night and day:<br />
	And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,<br />
	And gibe the old and grey,<br />
	And some grow mad, and all grow bad,<br />
	And none a word may say.</p>
<p>
	Each narrow cell in which we dwell<br />
	Is foul and dark latrine,<br />
	And the fetid breath of living Death<br />
	Chokes up each grated screen,<br />
	And all, but Lust, is turned to dust<br />
	In Humanity&#39;s machine.</p>
<p>
	The brackish water that we drink<br />
	Creeps with a loathsome slime,<br />
	And the bitter bread they weigh in scales<br />
	Is full of chalk and lime,<br />
	And Sleep will not lie down, but walks<br />
	Wild-eyed and cries to Time.</p>
<p>
	But though lean Hunger and green Thirst<br />
	Like asp with adder fight,<br />
	We have little care of prison fare,<br />
	For what chills and kills outright<br />
	Is that every stone one lifts by day<br />
	Becomes one&#39;s heart by night.</p>
<p>
	With midnight always in one&#39;s heart,<br />
	And twilight in one&#39;s cell,<br />
	We turn the crank, or tear the rope,<br />
	Each in his separate Hell,<br />
	And the silence is more awful far<br />
	Than the sound of a brazen bell.</p>
<p>
	And never a human voice comes near<br />
	To speak a gentle word:<br />
	And the eye that watches through the door<br />
	Is pitiless and hard:<br />
	And by all forgot, we rot and rot,<br />
	With soul and body marred.</p>
<p>
	And thus we rust Life&#39;s iron chain<br />
	Degraded and alone:<br />
	And some men curse, and some men weep,<br />
	And some men make no moan:<br />
	But God&#39;s eternal Laws are kind<br />
	And break the heart of stone.</p>
<p>
	And every human heart that breaks,<br />
	In prison-cell or yard,<br />
	Is as that broken box that gave<br />
	Its treasure to the Lord,<br />
	And filled the unclean leper&#39;s house<br />
	With the scent of costliest nard.</p>
<p>
	Ah! happy day they whose hearts can break<br />
	And peace of pardon win!<br />
	How else may man make straight his plan<br />
	And cleanse his soul from Sin?<br />
	How else but through a broken heart<br />
	May Lord Christ enter in?</p>
<p>
	And he of the swollen purple throat.<br />
	And the stark and staring eyes,<br />
	Waits for the holy hands that took<br />
	The Thief to Paradise;<br />
	And a broken and a contrite heart<br />
	The Lord will not despise.</p>
<p>
	The man in red who reads the Law<br />
	Gave him three weeks of life,<br />
	Three little weeks in which to heal<br />
	His soul of his soul&#39;s strife,<br />
	And cleanse from every blot of blood<br />
	The hand that held the knife.</p>
<p>
	And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,<br />
	The hand that held the steel:<br />
	For only blood can wipe out blood,<br />
	And only tears can heal:<br />
	And the crimson stain that was of Cain<br />
	Became Christ&#39;s snow-white seal.</p>
<p>
	VI.</p>
<p>
	In Reading gaol by Reading town<br />
	There is a pit of shame,<br />
	And in it lies a wretched man<br />
	Eaten by teeth of flame,<br />
	In burning winding-sheet he lies,<br />
	And his grave has got no name.</p>
<p>
	And there, till Christ call forth the dead,<br />
	In silence let him lie:<br />
	No need to waste the foolish tear,<br />
	Or heave the windy sigh:<br />
	The man had killed the thing he loved,<br />
	And so he had to die.</p>
<p>
	And all men kill the thing they love,<br />
	By all let this be heard,<br />
	Some do it with a bitter look,<br />
	Some with a flattering word,<br />
	The coward does it with a kiss,<br />
	The brave man with a sword!</p>
