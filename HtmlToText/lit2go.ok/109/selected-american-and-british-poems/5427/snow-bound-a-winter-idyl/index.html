                <p>
	The sun that brief December day<br />
	Rose cheerless over hills of gray,<br />
	And, darkly circled, gave at noon<br />
	A sadder light than waning moon.<br />
	Slow tracing down the thickening sky<br />
	Its mute and ominous prophecy,<br />
	A portent seeming less than threat,<br />
	It sank from sight before it set.<br />
	A chill no coat, however stout,<br />
	Of homespun stuff could quite shut out,<br />
	A hard, dull bitterness of cold,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; That checked, mid&ndash;vein, the circling race<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Of life&ndash;blood in the sharpened face,<br />
	The coming of the snow&ndash;storm told.<br />
	The wind blew east; we heard the roar<br />
	Of Ocean on his wintry shore,<br />
	And felt the strong pulse throbbing there<br />
	Beat with low rhythm our inland air.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile we did our nightly chores,&mdash;<br />
	Brought in the wood from out of doors,<br />
	Littered the stalls, and from the mows<br />
	Raked down the herd&#39;s&ndash;grass for the cows;<br />
	Heard the horse whinnying for his corn;<br />
	And, sharply clashing horn on horn,<br />
	Impatient down the stanchion rows<br />
	The cattle shake their walnut bows;<br />
	While, peering from his early perch<br />
	Upon the scaffold&#39;s pole of birch,<br />
	The cock his crested helmet bent<br />
	And down his querulous challenge sent.</p>
<p>
	Unwarmed by any sunset light<br />
	The gray day darkened into night,<br />
	A night made hoary with the swarm<br />
	And whirl&ndash;dance of the blinding storm,<br />
	As zigzag, wavering to and fro,<br />
	Crossed and recrossed the wing&agrave;d snow:<br />
	And ere the early bedtime came<br />
	The white drift piled the window&ndash;frame,<br />
	And through the glass the clothes&ndash;line posts<br />
	Looked in like tall and sheeted ghosts.</p>
<p>
	So all night long the storm roared on:<br />
	The morning broke without a sun;<br />
	In tiny spherule traced with lines Of Nature&#39;s geometric signs,<br />
	And, when the second morning shone,<br />
	We looked upon a world unknown,<br />
	On nothing we could call our own.<br />
	Around the glistening wonder bent<br />
	The blue walls of the firmament,<br />
	No cloud above, no earth below,&mdash;<br />
	A universe of sky and snow!<br />
	The old familiar sights of ours<br />
	Took marvellous shapes; strange domes and towers<br />
	Rose up where sty or corn&ndash;crib stood,<br />
	Or garden&ndash;wall, or belt of wood;<br />
	A smooth white mound the brush&ndash;pile showed,<br />
	A fenceless drift what once was road;<br />
	The bridle&ndash;post an old man sat<br />
	With loose&ndash;flung coat and high cocked hat;<br />
	The well&ndash;curb had a Chinese roof;<br />
	And even the long sweep, high aloof,<br />
	In its slant spendor, seemed to tell<br />
	Of Pisa&#39;s leaning miracle.</p>
<p>
	A prompt, decisive man, no breath<br />
	Our father wasted: &quot;Boys, a path!&quot;<br />
	Well pleased, (for when did farmer boy<br />
	Count such a summons less than joy?)<br />
	Our buskins on our feet we drew;<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; With mittened hands, and caps drawn low,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; To guard our necks and ears from snow,<br />
	We cut the solid whiteness through.<br />
	And, where the drift was deepest, made A tunnel walled and overlaid<br />
	With dazzling crystal: we had read<br />
	Of rare Aladdin&#39;s wondrous cave,<br />
	And to our own his name we gave,<br />
	With many a wish the luck were ours<br />
	To test his lamp&#39;s supernal powers.<br />
	We reached the barn with merry din,<br />
	And roused the prisoned brutes within.<br />
	The old horse thrust his long head out,<br />
	And grave with wonder gazed about;<br />
	The cock his lusty greeting said,<br />
	And forth his speckled harem led;<br />
	The oxen lashed their tails, and hooked,<br />
	And mild reproach of hunger looked;<br />
	The horn�d patriarch of the sheep,<br />
	Like Egypt&#39;s Amun roused from sleep,<br />
	Shook his sage head with gesture mute,<br />
	And emphasized with stamp of foot.</p>
<p>
	All day the gusty north&ndash;wind bore<br />
	The loosening drift its breath before;<br />
	Low circling round its southern zone,<br />
	The sun through dazzling snow&ndash;mist shone.<br />
	No church&ndash;bell lent its Christian tone<br />
	To the savage air, no social smoke<br />
	Curled over woods of snow&ndash;hung oak.<br />
	A solitude made more intense<br />
	By dreary&ndash;voic�d elements,<br />
	The shrieking of the mindless wind,<br />
	The moaning tree&ndash;boughs swaying blind,<br />
	And on the glass the unmeaning beat<br />
	Of ghostly finger&ndash;tips of sleet.<br />
	Beyond the circle of our hearth<br />
	No welcome sound of toil or mirth<br />
	Unbound the spell, and testified<br />
	Of human life and thought outside.<br />
	We minded that the sharpest ear<br />
	The buried brooklet could not hear,<br />
	The music of whose liquid lip<br />
	Had been to us companionship,<br />
	And, in our lonely life, had grown<br />
	To have an almost human tone.</p>
<p>
	As night drew on, and, from the crest<br />
	Of wooded knolls that ridged the west,<br />
	The sun, a snow&ndash;blown traveller, sank<br />
	From sight beneath the smothering bank,<br />
	We piled, with care, our nightly stack<br />
	Of wood against the chimney&ndash;back,&mdash;<br />
	The oaken log, green, huge, and thick,<br />
	And on its top the stout back&ndash;stick;<br />
	The knotty forestick laid apart,<br />
	And filled between with curious art</p>
<p>
	The ragged brush; then, hovering near,<br />
	We watched the first red blaze appear,<br />
	Heard the sharp crackle, caught the gleam<br />
	On whitewashed wall and sagging beam,<br />
	Until the old, rude&ndash;furnished room<br />
	Burst, flower&ndash;like, into rosy bloom;<br />
	While radiant with a mimic flame<br />
	Outside the sparkling drift became,<br />
	And through the bare&ndash;boughed lilac&ndash;tree<br />
	Our own warm hearth seemed blazing free.<br />
	The crane and pendent trammels showed,<br />
	The Turks&#39; heads on the andirons glowed;<br />
	While childish fancy, prompt to tell<br />
	The meaning of the miracle,<br />
	Whispered the old rhyme: &quot;Under the tree,<br />
	When fire outdoors burns merrily,<br />
	There the witches are making tea.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The moon above the eastern wood<br />
	Shone at its full; the hill&ndash;range stood<br />
	Transfigured in the silver flood,<br />
	Its blown snows flashing cold and keen,<br />
	Dead white, save where some sharp ravine<br />
	Took shadow, or the sombre green<br />
	Of hemlocks turned to pitchy black<br />
	Against the whiteness at their back.<br />
	For such a world and such a night<br />
	Most fitting that unwarming light,<br />
	Which only seemed where&#39;er it fell<br />
	To make the coldness visible.</p>
<p>
	Shut in from all the world without,<br />
	We sat the clean&ndash;winged hearth about,<br />
	Content to let the north&ndash;wind roar<br />
	In baffled rage at pane and door,<br />
	While the red logs before us beat<br />
	The frost&ndash;line back with tropic heat;<br />
	And ever, when a louder blast<br />
	Shook beam and rafter as it passed,<br />
	The merrier up its roaring draught<br />
	The great throat of the chimney laughed;<br />
	The house&ndash;dog on his paws outspread<br />
	Laid to the fire his drowsy head,<br />
	The cat&#39;s dark silhouette on the wall<br />
	A couchant tiger&#39;s seemed to fall;<br />
	And, for the winter fireside meet,<br />
	Between the andirons&#39; straddling feet,<br />
	The mug of cider simmered slow,<br />
	The apples sputtered in a row,<br />
	And, close at hand, the basket stood<br />
	With nuts from brown October&#39;s wood.</p>
<p>
	What matter how the night behaved?<br />
	What matter how the north&ndash;wind raved?<br />
	Blow high, blow low, not all its snow<br />
	Could quench our hearth&ndash;fire&#39;s ruddy glow.<br />
	O Time and Change!&mdash;with hair as gray<br />
	As was my sire&#39;s that winter day,<br />
	How strange it seems, with so much gone<br />
	Of life and love, to still live on!<br />
	Ah, brother! only I and thou<br />
	Are left of all that circle now,&mdash;<br />
	The dear home faces whereupon<br />
	That fitful firelight paled and shone.<br />
	Henceforward, listen as we will,<br />
	The voices of that hearth are still;<br />
	Look where we may, the wide earth o&#39;er,<br />
	Those lighted faces smile no more.</p>
<p>
	We tread the paths their feet have worn,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; We sit beneath their orchard trees,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; We hear, like them, the hum of bees<br />
	And rustle of the bladed corn;<br />
	We turn the pages that they read,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Their written words we linger o&#39;er,<br />
	But in the sun they cast no shade,<br />
	No voice is heard, no sign is made,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; No step is on the conscious floor!<br />
	Yet Love will dream, and Faith will trust,<br />
	(Since He who knows our need is just,)<br />
	That somehow, somewhere, meet we must.<br />
	Alas for him who never sees<br />
	The stars shine through his cypress&ndash;trees!<br />
	Who, hopeless, lays his dead away,<br />
	Nor looks to see the breaking day<br />
	Across the mournful marbles play!<br />
	Who hath not learned, in hours of faith,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The truth to flesh and sense unknown,<br />
	That Life is ever lord of Death,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; And Love can never lose its own!</p>
<p>
	We sped the time with stories old,<br />
	Wrought puzzles out, and riddles told,<br />
	Or stammered from our school&ndash;book lore<br />
	&quot;The Chief of Gambia&#39;s golden shore.&quot;<br />
	How often since, when all the land<br />
	Was clay in Slavery&#39;s shaping hand,<br />
	As if a far&ndash;blown trumpet stirred<br />
	Dame Mercy Warren&#39;s rousing word:<br />
	&quot;Does not the voice of reason cry,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Claim the first right which Nature gave,<br />
	From the red scourge of bondage to fly,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor deign to live a burdened slave!&quot;<br />
	Our father rode again his ride<br />
	On Memphremagog&#39;s wooded side;<br />
	Sat down again to moose and samp<br />
	In trapper&#39;s hut and Indian camp;<br />
	Lived o&#39;er the old idyllic ease<br />
	Beneath St. Fran�ois&#39; hemlock&ndash;trees;<br />
	Again for him the moonlight shone<br />
	On Norman cap and bodiced zone;<br />
	Again he heard the violin play<br />
	Which led the village dance away.<br />
	And mingled in its merry whirl<br />
	The grandam and the laughing girl.<br />
	Or, nearer home, our steps he led<br />
	Where Salisbury&#39;s level marshes spread<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Mile&ndash;wide as flies the laden bee;<br />
	Where merry mowers, hale and strong,<br />
	Swept, scythe on scythe, their swaths along<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The low green prairies of the sea.<br />
	We shared the fishing off Boar&#39;s Head,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And round the rocky Isles of Shoals<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The hake&ndash;broil on the drift&ndash;wood coals;<br />
	The chowder on the sand&ndash;beach made,<br />
	Dipped by the hungry, steaming hot,<br />
	With spoons of clam&ndash;shell from the pot.<br />
	We heard the tales of witchcraft old,<br />
	And dream and sign and marvel told<br />
	To sleepy listeners as they lay<br />
	Stretched idly on the salted hay,<br />
	Adrift along the winding shores,<br />
	When favoring breezes deigned to blow<br />
	The square sail of the gundelow<br />
	And idle lay the useless oars.</p>
<p>
	Our mother, while she turned her wheel<br />
	Or run the new&ndash;knit stocking&ndash;heel,<br />
	Told how the Indian hordes came down<br />
	At midnight on Concheco town,<br />
	And how her own great&ndash;uncle bore<br />
	His cruel scalp&ndash;mark to fourscore.<br />
	Recalling, in her fitting phrase,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So rich and picturesque and free<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; (The common unrhymed poetry<br />
	Of simple life and country ways,)<br />
	The story of her early days,&mdash;<br />
	She made us welcome to her home;<br />
	Old hearths grew wide to give us room;<br />
	We stole with her a frightened look<br />
	At the gray wizard&#39;s conjuring&ndash;book,<br />
	The fame whereof went far and wide<br />
	Through all the simple country side;<br />
	We heard the hawks at twilight play,<br />
	The boat&ndash;horn on Piscataqua,<br />
	The loon&#39;s weird laughter far away;<br />
	We fished her little trout&ndash;brook, knew<br />
	What flowers in wood and meadow grew,<br />
	What sunny hillsides autumn&ndash;brown<br />
	She climbed to shake the ripe nuts down,<br />
	Saw where in sheltered cove and bay,<br />
	The ducks&#39; black squadron anchored lay,<br />
	And heard the wild&ndash;geese calling loud<br />
	Beneath the gray November cloud.<br />
	Then, haply, with a look more grave,<br />
	And soberer tone, some tale she gave<br />
	From painful Sewel&#39;s ancient tome,<br />
	Beloved in every Quaker home,<br />
	Of faith fire&ndash;winged by martyrdom,<br />
	Or Chalkley&#39;s Journal, old and quaint,&mdash;<br />
	Gentlest of skippers, rare sea&ndash;saint!&mdash;<br />
	Who, when the dreary calms prevailed,<br />
	And water&ndash;butt and bread&ndash;cask failed,<br />
	And cruel, hungry eyes pursued<br />
	His portly presence mad for food,<br />
	With dark hints muttered under breath<br />
	Of casting lots for life or death,</p>
<br />
<p>
	Offered, if Heaven withheld supplies,<br />
	To be himself the sacrifice.<br />
	Then, suddenly, as if to save<br />
	The good man from his living grave,<br />
	A ripple on the water grew,<br />
	A school of porpoise flashed in view.<br />
	&quot;Take, eat,&quot; he said, &quot;and be content;<br />
	These fishes in my stead are sent<br />
	By Him who gave the tangled ram<br />
	To spare the child of Abraham.&quot;<br />
	Our uncle, innocent of books,<br />
	Was rich in lore of fields and brooks,<br />
	The ancient teachers never dumb<br />
	Of Nature&#39;s unhoused lyceum.<br />
	In moons and tides and weather wise,<br />
	He read the clouds as prophecies,<br />
	And foul or fair could well divine,<br />
	By many an occult hint and sign,<br />
	Holding the cunning&ndash;warded keys<br />
	To all the woodcraft mysteries;<br />
	Himself to Nature&#39;s heart so near<br />
	vThat all her voices in his ear<br />
	Of beast or bird had meanings clear,<br />
	Like Apollonius of old,<br />
	Who knew the tales the sparrows told,<br />
	Or Hermes, who interpreted<br />
	What the sage cranes of Nilus said; A simple, guileless, childlike man,</p>
<p>
	Content to live where life began;<br />
	Strong only on his native grounds,<br />
	The little world of sights and sounds<br />
	Whose girdle was the parish bounds,<br />
	Whereof his fondly partial pride<br />
	The common features magnified,<br />
	As Surrey hills to mountains grew<br />
	In White of Selborne&#39;s loving view,&mdash;<br />
	He told how teal and loon he shot,<br />
	And how the eagle&#39;s eggs he got,<br />
	The feats on pond and river done,<br />
	The prodigies of rod and gun;<br />
	Till, warming with the tales he told,<br />
	Forgotten was the outside cold,<br />
	The bitter wind unheeded blew,<br />
	From ripening corn the pigeons flew,<br />
	The partridge drummed i&#39; the wood, the mink<br />
	Went fishing down the river&ndash;brink.<br />
	In fields with bean or clover gay,<br />
	The woodchuck, like a hermit gray,<br />
	Peered from the doorway of his cell;<br />
	The muskrat plied the mason&#39;s trade,<br />
	And tier by tier his mud&ndash;walls laid;<br />
	And from the shagbark overhead<br />
	The grizzled squirrel dropped his shell.</p>
<p>
	Next, the dear aunt, whose smile of cheer<br />
	And voice in dreams I see and hear,&mdash;<br />
	The sweetest woman ever Fate<br />
	Perverse denied a household mate,<br />
	Who, lonely, homeless, not the less<br />
	Found peace in love&#39;s unselfishness,<br />
	And welcome wheresoe&#39;er she went,<br />
	A calm and gracious element,<br />
	Whose presence seemed the sweet income<br />
	And womanly atmosphere of home,&mdash;<br />
	Called up her girlhood memories,<br />
	The huskings and the apple&ndash;bees,<br />
	The sleigh&ndash;rides and the summer sails,<br />
	Weaving through all the poor details<br />
	And homespun warp of circumstance<br />
	A golden woof&ndash;thread of romance.<br />
	For well she kept her genial mood<br />
	And simple faith of maidenhood;<br />
	Before her still a cloud&ndash;land lay,<br />
	The mirage loomed across her way;<br />
	The morning dew, that dries so soon<br />
	With others, glistened at her noon;<br />
	Through years of toil and soil and care,<br />
	From glossy tress to thin gray hair,<br />
	All unprofaned she held apart<br />
	The virgin fancies of the heart.<br />
	Be shame to him of woman born<br />
	Who hath for such but thought of scorn.<br />
	There, too, our elder sister plied<br />
	Her evening task the stand beside;<br />
	A full, rich nature, free to trust,<br />
	Truthful and almost sternly just,<br />
	Impulsive, earnest, prompt to act,<br />
	And make her generous thought a fact,<br />
	Keeping with many a light disguise<br />
	The secret of self&ndash;sacrifice.</p>
<p>
	O heart sore&ndash;tried! thou hast the best<br />
	That Heaven itself could give thee,&mdash;rest,<br />
	Rest from all bitter thoughts and things!<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; How many a poor one&#39;s blessing went<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; With thee beneath the low green tent<br />
	Whose curtain never outward swings!</p>
<p>
	As one who held herself a part<br />
	Of all she saw, and let her heart<br />
	Against the household bosom lean,<br />
	Upon the motley&ndash;braided mat<br />
	Our youngest and our dearest sat,<br />
	Lifting her large, sweet, asking eyes,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Now bathed in the unfading green<br />
	And holy peace of Paradise.<br />
	Oh, looking from some heavenly hill,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Or from the shade of saintly palms,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Or silver reach of river calms,<br />
	Do those large eyes behold me still?<br />
	With me one little year ago:&mdash;<br />
	The chill weight of the winter snow<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; For months upon her grave has lain;<br />
	And now, when summer south&ndash;winds blow<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; And brier and harebell bloom again,<br />
	I tread the pleasant paths we trod,<br />
	I see the violet&ndash;sprinkled sod<br />
	Whereon she leaned, too frail and weak<br />
	The hillside flowers she loved to seek,<br />
	Yet following me where&#39;er I went<br />
	With dark eyes full of love&#39;s content.<br />
	The birds are glad; the brier&ndash;rose fills<br />
	The air with sweetness; all the hills<br />
	Stretch green to June&#39;s unclouded sky;<br />
	But still I wait with ear and eye<br />
	For something gone which should be nigh,<br />
	A loss in all familiar things,<br />
	In flower that blooms, and bird that sings.<br />
	And yet, dear heart! remembering thee,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I not richer than of old?<br />
	Safe in thy immortality,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; What change can reach the wealth I hold?<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; What chance can mar the pearl and gold<br />
	Thy love hath left in trust with me?<br />
	And while in life&#39;s late afternoon,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Where cool and long the shadows grow,<br />
	I walk to meet the night that soon<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall shape and shadow overflow,<br />
	I cannot feel that thou art far,<br />
	Since near at need the angels are;<br />
	And when the sunset gates unbar,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall I not see thee waiting stand,<br />
	And, white against the evening star,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The welcome of thy beckoning hand?</p>
<p>
	Brisk wielder of the birch and rule,<br />
	The master of the district school<br />
	Held at the fire his favored place,<br />
	Its warm glow lit a laughing face<br />
	Fresh&ndash;hued and fair, where scarce appeared<br />
	The uncertain prophecy of beard.<br />
	He teased the mitten&ndash;blinded cat,<br />
	Played cross&ndash;pins on my uncle&#39;s hat,<br />
	Sang songs, and told us what befalls<br />
	In classic Dartmouth&#39;s college halls.<br />
	Born the wild Northern hills among,<br />
	From whence his yeoman father wrung<br />
	By patient toil subsistence scant,<br />
	Not competence and yet not want,<br />
	He early gained the power to pay<br />
	His cheerful, self&ndash;reliant way;<br />
	Could doff at ease his scholar&#39;s gown<br />
	To peddle wares from town to town;<br />
	Or through the long vacation&#39;s reach<br />
	In lonely lowland districts teach,<br />
	Where all the droll experience found<br />
	At stranger hearths in boarding round,<br />
	The moonlit skater&#39;s keen delight,<br />
	The sleigh&ndash;drive through the frosty night,<br />
	The rustic party, with its rough<br />
	Accompaniment of blind&ndash;man&#39;s&ndash;buff,<br />
	And whirling&ndash;plate, and forfeits paid,<br />
	His winter task a pastime made.<br />
	Happy the snow&ndash;locked homes wherein<br />
	He tuned his merry violin,</p>
<p>
	Or played the athlete in the barn, Or held the good dame&#39;s winding&ndash;yarn,<br />
	Or mirth&ndash;provoking versions told<br />
	Of classic legends rare and old,<br />
	Wherein the scenes of Greece and Rome<br />
	Had all the commonplace of home,<br />
	And little seemed at best the odds<br />
	&#39;Twixt Yankee pedlers and old gods;<br />
	Where Pindus&ndash;born Arachthus took<br />
	The guise of any grist&ndash;mill brook,<br />
	And dread Olympus at his will<br />
	Became a huckleberry hill.</p>
<p>
	A careless boy that night he seemed;<br />
	But at his desk he had the look<br />
	And air of one who wisely schemed,<br />
	And hostage from the future took<br />
	In train�d thought and lore of book.<br />
	Large&ndash;brained, clear&ndash;eyed, of such as he<br />
	Shall Freedom&#39;s young apostles be,<br />
	Who, following in War&#39;s bloody trail,<br />
	Shall every lingering wrong assail;<br />
	All chains from limb and spirit strike,<br />
	Uplift the black and white alike;<br />
	Scatter before their swift advance<br />
	The darkness and the ignorance,<br />
	The pride, the lust, the squalid sloth,<br />
	Which nurtured Treason&#39;s monstrous growth,<br />
	Made murder pastime, and the hell<br />
	Of prison&ndash;torture possible;<br />
	The cruel lie of caste refute,<br />
	Old forms remould, and substitute<br />
	For Slavery&#39;s lash the freeman&#39;s will,<br />
	For blind routine, wise&ndash;handed skill;<br />
	A school&ndash;house plant on every hill,<br />
	Stretching in radiate nerve&ndash;lines thence<br />
	The quick wires of intelligence;<br />
	Till North and South together brought<br />
	Shall own the same electric thought,<br />
	In peace a common flag salute,<br />
	And, side by side in labor&#39;s free<br />
	And unresentful rivalry,<br />
	Harvest the fields wherein they fought.</p>
<p>
	Another guest that winter night<br />
	Flashed back from lustrous eyes the light.<br />
	Unmarked by time, and yet not young,<br />
	The honeyed music of her tongue<br />
	And words of meekness scarcely told<br />
	A nature passionate and bold,</p>
<p>
	Strong, self&ndash;concentred, spurning guide,<br />
	Its milder features dwarfed beside<br />
	Her unbent will&#39;s majestic pride.<br />
	She sat among us, at the best,<br />
	A not unfeared, half&ndash;welcome guest,<br />
	Rebuking with her cultured phrase<br />
	Our homeliness of words and ways.<br />
	A certain pard&ndash;like, treacherous grace<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Swayed the lithe limbs and drooped the lash,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Lent the white teeth their dazzling flash;<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; And under low brows, black with night,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayed out at times a dangerous light;<br />
	The sharp heat&ndash;lightnings of her face<br />
	Presaging ill to him whom Fate<br />
	Condemned to share her love or hate.<br />
	A woman tropical, intense<br />
	In thought and act, in soul and sense,<br />
	She blended in a like degree<br />
	The vixen and the devotee,<br />
	Revealing with each freak or feint<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The temper of Petruchio&#39;s Kate,<br />
	The raptures of Siena&#39;s saint.<br />
	Her tapering hand and rounded wrist<br />
	Had facile power to form a fist;<br />
	The warm, dark languish of her eyes<br />
	Was never safe from wrath&#39;s surprise.<br />
	Brows saintly calm and lips devout<br />
	Knew every change of scowl and pout;<br />
	And the sweet voice had notes more high<br />
	And shrill for social battle&ndash;cry.</p>
<p>
	Since then what old cathedral town<br />
	Has missed her pilgrim staff and gown,<br />
	What convent&ndash;gate has held its lock<br />
	Against the challenge of her knock!<br />
	Through Smyrna&#39;s plague&ndash;hushed thoroughfares,<br />
	Up sea&ndash;set Malta&#39;s rocky stairs,<br />
	Gray olive slopes of hills that hem<br />
	Thy tombs and shrines, Jerusalem,<br />
	Or startling on her desert throne<br />
	The crazy Queen of Lebanon<br />
	With claims fantastic as her own,<br />
	Her tireless feet have held their way;<br />
	And still, unrestful, bowed, and gray,<br />
	She watches under Eastern skies,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; With hope each day renewed and fresh,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord&#39;s quick coming in the flesh,<br />
	Whereof she dreams and prophesies!<br />
	Where&#39;er her troubled path may be,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord&#39;s sweet pity with her go!<br />
	The outward wayward life we see,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The hidden springs we may not know.<br />
	Nor is it given us to discern<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; What threads the fatal sisters spun,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Through what ancestral years has run<br />
	The sorrow with the woman born,<br />
	What forged her cruel chain of moods,<br />
	What set her feet in solitudes,<br />
	And held the love within her mute,<br />
	What mingled madness in the blood,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; A life&ndash;long discord and annoy,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Water of tears with oil of joy,<br />
	And hid within the folded bud<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Perversities of flower and fruit.<br />
	It is not ours to separate<br />
	The tangled skein of will and fate,<br />
	To show what metes and bounds should stand<br />
	Upon the soul&#39;s debatable land,<br />
	And between choice and Providence<br />
	Divide the circle of events;<br />
	But He who knows our frame is just,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Merciful and compassionate,<br />
	And full of sweet assurances<br />
	And hope for all the language is,<br />
	That He remembereth we are dust!</p>
<p>
	At last the great logs, crumbling low,<br />
	Sent out a dull and duller glow,<br />
	The bull&#39;s&ndash;eye watch that hung in view,<br />
	Ticking its weary circuit through,<br />
	Pointed with mutely warning sign<br />
	Its black hand to the hour of nine.<br />
	That sign the pleasant circle broke:<br />
	My uncle ceased his pipe to smoke,<br />
	Knocked from its bowl the refuse gray,<br />
	And laid it tenderly away;<br />
	Then roused himself to safely cover<br />
	The dull red brands with ashes over.<br />
	And while, with care, our mother laid<br />
	The work aside, her steps she stayed<br />
	One moment, seeking to express<br />
	Her grateful sense of happiness<br />
	For food and shelter, warmth and health,<br />
	And love&#39;s contentment more than wealth,<br />
	With simple wishes (not the weak,<br />
	Vain prayers which no fulfilment seek,<br />
	But such as warm the generous heart,<br />
	O&#39;er&ndash;prompt to do with Heaven its part)<br />
	That none might lack, that bitter night,<br />
	For bread and clothing, warmth and light.</p>
<p>
	Within our beds awhile we heard<br />
	The wind that round the gables roared,<br />
	With now and then a ruder shock,<br />
	Which made our very bedsteads rock.<br />
	We heard the loosened clapboards tost,<br />
	The board&ndash;nails snapping in the frost;<br />
	And on us, through the unplastered wall,<br />
	Felt the light sifted snow&ndash;flakes fall.<br />
	But sleep stole on, as sleep will do<br />
	When hearts are light and life is new;<br />
	Faint and more faint the murmurs grew,<br />
	Till in the summer&ndash;land of dreams<br />
	They softened to the sound of streams,<br />
	Low stir of leaves, and dip of oars,<br />
	And lapsing waves on quiet shores. Of merry voices high and clear;<br />
	And saw the teamsters drawing near<br />
	To break the drifted highways out.<br />
	Down the long hillside treading slow<br />
	We saw the half&ndash;buried oxen go,<br />
	Shaking the snow from heads uptost,<br />
	Their straining nostrils white with frost.<br />
	Before our door the straggling train vDrew up, an added team to gain.<br />
	The elders threshed their hands a&ndash;cold,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Passed, with the cider&ndash;mug, their jokes<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; From lip to lip; the younger folks<br />
	Down the loose snow&ndash;banks, wrestling, rolled,<br />
	Then toiled again the cavalcade<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; O&#39;er windy hill, through clogged ravine,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; And woodland paths that wound between<br />
	Low drooping pine&ndash;boughs winter&ndash;weighed.<br />
	From every barn a team afoot,<br />
	At every house a new recruit,<br />
	Where, drawn by Nature&#39;s subtlest law,<br />
	Haply the watchful young men saw<br />
	Sweet doorway pictures of the curls<br />
	And curious eyes of merry girls,<br />
	Lifting their hands in mock defence<br />
	Against the snow&ndash;ball&#39;s compliments,<br />
	And reading in each missive tost<br />
	The charm with Eden never lost.<br />
	We heard once more the sleigh&ndash;bells&#39; sound;<br />
	And, following where the teamsters led,<br />
	The wise old Doctor went his round,<br />
	Just pausing at our door to say,<br />
	In the brief autocratic way<br />
	Of one who, prompt at Duty&#39;s call,<br />
	Was free to urge her claim on all,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; That some poor neighbor sick abed<br />
	At night our mother&#39;s aid would need.<br />
	For, one in generous thought and deed,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; What mattered in the sufferer&#39;s sight<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The Quaker matron&#39;s inward light,<br />
	The Doctor&#39;s mail of Calvin&#39;s creed?<br />
	All hearts confess the saints elect<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, twain in faith, in love agree,<br />
	And melt not in an acid sect<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The Christian pearl of charity!</p>
<p>
	So days went on: a week had passed<br />
	Since the great world was heard from last.<br />
	The Almanac we studied o&#39;er,<br />
	Read and reread our little store<br />
	Of books and pamphlets, scarce a score;<br />
	One harmless novel, mostly hid<br />
	From younger eyes, a book forbid,<br />
	And poetry, (or good or bad,<br />
	A single book was all we had,) Where Ellwood&#39;s meek, drab&ndash;skirted Muse,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; A stranger to the heathen Nine,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Sang, with a somewhat nasal whine,<br />
	The wars of David and the Jews.<br />
	At last the floundering carrier bore<br />
	The village paper to our door.<br />
	Lo! broadening outward as we read,<br />
	To warmer zones the horizon spread<br />
	In panoramic length unrolled<br />
	We saw the marvels that it told.<br />
	Before us passed the painted Creeks,<br />
	A&nbsp;&nbsp; nd daft McGregor on his raids<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; In Costa Rica&#39;s everglades.<br />
	And up Taygetos winding slow<br />
	Rode Ypsilanti&#39;s Mainote Greeks,<br />
	A Turk&#39;s head at each saddle&ndash;bow!<br />
	Welcome to us its week&ndash;old news,<br />
	Its corner for the rustic Muse,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Its monthly gauge of snow and rain,<br />
	Its record, mingling in a breath<br />
	The wedding bell and dirge of death:<br />
	Jest, anecdote, and love&ndash;lorn tale,<br />
	The latest culprit sent to jail;<br />
	Its hue and cry of stolen and lost,<br />
	Its vendue sales and goods at cost,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; And traffic calling loud for gain.<br />
	We felt the stir of hall and street,<br />
	The pulse of life that round us beat;<br />
	The chill embargo of the snow<br />
	Was melted in the genial glow;<br />
	Wide swung again our ice&ndash;locked door,<br />
	And all the world was ours once more!</p>
<p>
	Clasp, Angel of the backword look<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; And folded wings of ashen gray<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; And voice of echoes far away,<br />
	The brazen covers of thy book;<br />
	The weird palimpsest old and vast,<br />
	Wherein thou hid&#39;st the spectral past;<br />
	Where, closely mingling, pale and glow<br />
	The characters of joy and woe;<br />
	The monographs of outlived years,<br />
	Or smile&ndash;illumed or dim with tears,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Green hills of life that slope to death,<br />
	And haunts of home, whose vistaed trees<br />
	Shade off to mournful cypresses<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; With the white amaranths underneath.<br />
	Even while I look, I can but heed<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The restless sands&#39; incessant fall,<br />
	Importunate hours that hours succeed,<br />
	Each clamorous with its own sharp need,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; And duty keeping pace with all.<br />
	Shut down and clasp with heavy lids;<br />
	I hear again the voice that bids<br />
	The dreamer leave his dream midway<br />
	For larger hopes and graver fears:<br />
	Life greatens in these later years,<br />
	The century&#39;s aloe flowers to&ndash;day!</p>
<p>
	Yet, haply, in some lull of life,<br />
	Some Truce of God which breaks its strife,<br />
	The worldling&#39;s eyes shall gather dew,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Dreaming in throngful city ways<br />
	Of winter joys his boyhood knew;<br />
	And dear and early friends&mdash;the few<br />
	Who yet remain&mdash;shall pause to view<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; These Flemish pictures of old days;<br />
	Sit with me by the homestead hearth,<br />
	And stretch the hands of memory forth<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; To warm them at the wood&ndash;fire&#39;s blaze!<br />
	And thanks untraced to lips unknown<br />
	Shall greet me like the odors blown<br />
	From unseen meadows newly mown,<br />
	Wood&ndash;fringed, the wayside gaze beyond;<br />
	The traveller owns the grateful sense<br />
	Of sweetness near, he knows not whence,<br />
	And, pausing, takes with forehead bare<br />
	The benediction of the air.</p>
