                <p>
	There was great excitement in Miltonville over the advent of a most eloquent and convincing minister from the North. The beauty about the Rev. Thaddeus Warwick was that he was purely and simply a man of the doctrine. He had no emotions, his sermons were never matters of feeling; but he insisted so strongly upon the constant presentation of the tenets of his creed that his presence in a town was always marked by the enthusiasm and joy of religious disputation.</p>
<p>
	The Rev. Jasper Hayward, coloured, was a man quite of another stripe. With him it was not so much what a man held as what he felt. The difference in their characteristics, however, did not prevent him from attending Dr. Warwick&rsquo;s series of sermons, where, from the vantage point of the gallery, he drank in, without assimilating, that divine&rsquo;s words of wisdom.</p>
<p>
	Especially was he edified on the night that his white brother held forth upon the doctrine of predestination. It was not that he understood it at all, but that it sounded well and the words had a rich ring as he champed over them again and again.</p>
<p>
	Mr. Hayward was a man for the time and knew that his congregation desired something new, and if he could supply it he was willing to take lessons even from a white co&ndash;worker who had neither &ldquo;de spi&rsquo;it ner de fiah.&rdquo; Because, as he was prone to admit to himself, &ldquo;dey was sump&rsquo;in&rsquo; in de unnerstannin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He had no idea what plagiarism is, and without a single thought of wrong, he intended to reproduce for his people the religious wisdom which he acquired at the white church. He was an innocent beggar going to the doors of the well&ndash;provided for cold spiritual victuals to warm over for his own family. And it would not be plagiarism either, for this very warming&ndash;over process would save it from that and make his own whatever he brought. He would season with the pepper of his homely wit, sprinkle it with the salt of his home&ndash;made philosophy, then, hot with the fire of his crude eloquence, serve to his people a dish his very own. But to the true purveyor of original dishes it is never pleasant to know that someone else holds the secret of the groundwork of his invention.</p>
<p>
	It was then something of a shock to the Reverend Mr. Hayward to be accosted by Isaac Middleton, one of his members, just as he was leaving the gallery on the night of this most edifying of sermons.</p>
<p>
	Isaac laid a hand upon his shoulder and smiled at him benevolently.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;How do, Brothah Hayward,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you been sittin&rsquo; unner de drippin&rsquo;s of de gospel, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes, I has been listenin&rsquo; to de wo&rsquo;ds of my fellow&ndash;laborah in de vineya&rsquo;d of de Lawd,&rdquo; replied the preacher with some dignity, for he saw vanishing the vision of his own glory in a revivified sermon on predestination.</p>
<p>
	Isaac linked his arm familiarly in his pastor&rsquo;s as they went out upon the street.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, what you t&rsquo;ink erbout pre&ndash;o&rsquo;dination an&rsquo; fo&rsquo;&ndash;destination any how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It sutny has been pussented to us in a powahful light dis eve&rsquo;nin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, suh, hit opened up my eyes. I do&rsquo; know when I&rsquo;s hyeahed a sehmon dat done my soul mo&rsquo; good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It was a upliftin&rsquo; episode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Seem lak &lsquo;co&rsquo;din&rsquo; to de way de brothah &lsquo;lucidated de matter to&ndash;night dat evaht&rsquo;ing done sot out an&rsquo; cut an&rsquo; dried fu&rsquo; us. Well dat&rsquo;s gwine to he&rsquo;p me lots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;De gospel is allus a he&rsquo;p.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But not allus in dis way. You see I ain&rsquo;t a eddicated man lak you, Brothah Hayward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t all have de same &lsquo;vantages,&rdquo; the preacher condescended. &ldquo;But what I feels, I feels, an&rsquo; what I unnerstan&rsquo;s, I unnerstan&rsquo;s. The Scripture tell us to get unnerstannin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, dat&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;s been a&ndash;doin&rsquo; to&ndash;night. I&rsquo;s been a&ndash;doubtin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a&ndash;doubtin&rsquo;, a&ndash;foolin&rsquo; erroun&rsquo; an&rsquo; wonderin&rsquo;, but now I unnerstan&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&rdquo;&rsquo;Splain yo&rsquo;se&rsquo;f, Brothah Middleton,&rdquo; said the preacher.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, suh, I will to you. You knows Miss Sally Briggs? Huh, what say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The Reverend Hayward had given a half discernible start and an exclamation had fallen from his lips.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What say?&rdquo; repeated his companion.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I knows de sistah ve&rsquo;y well, she bein&rsquo; a membah of my flock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, I been gwine in comp&rsquo;ny wit dat ooman fu&rsquo; de longes&rsquo;. You ain&rsquo;t nevah tasted none o&rsquo; huh cookin&rsquo;, has you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I has &lsquo;sperienced de sistah&rsquo;s puffo&rsquo;mances in dat line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;She is the cookin&rsquo;est ooman I evah seed in all my life, but howsomedever, I been gwine all dis time an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo; nevah said de wo&rsquo;d. I nevah could git clean erway f&rsquo;om huh widout somep&rsquo;n&rsquo; drawin&rsquo; me back, an&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t know what hit was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The preacher was restless.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Hit was des dis away, Brothah Hayward, I was allus lingerin&rsquo; on de brink, feahful to la&rsquo;nch away, but now I&rsquo;s a&ndash;gwine to la&rsquo;nch, case dat all dis time tain&rsquo;t been nuffin but fo&rsquo;&ndash;destination dat been a&ndash;holdin&rsquo; me on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Ahem,&rdquo; said the minister; &ldquo;we mus&rsquo; not be in too big a hu&rsquo;y to put ouah human weaknesses upon some divine cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a&ndash;doin&rsquo; dat, dough I ain&rsquo;t a&ndash;sputin&rsquo; dat de lady is a mos&rsquo; oncommon fine lookin&rsquo; pusson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I has only seed huh wid de eye of de spi&rsquo;it,&rdquo; was the virtuous answer, &ldquo;an&rsquo; to dat eye all t&rsquo;ings dat are good are beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes, suh, an&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; wid de cookin&rsquo; eye, hit seem lak&rsquo; I des fo&rsquo;destinated fu&rsquo; to ma&rsquo;y dat ooman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You say you ain&rsquo;t axe huh yit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Not yit, but I&rsquo;s gwine to ez soon ez evah I gets de chanst now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Uh, huh,&rdquo; said the preacher, and he began to hasten his steps homeward.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Seems lak you in a pow&rsquo;ful hu&rsquo;y to&ndash;night,&rdquo; said his companion, with some difficulty accommodating his own step to the preacher&rsquo;s masterly strides. He was a short man and his pastor was tall and gaunt.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I has somp&rsquo;n&rsquo; on my min,&rsquo; Brothah Middleton, dat I wants to thrash out to&ndash;night in de sollertude of my own chambah,&rdquo; was the solemn reply.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, I ain&rsquo; gwine keep erlong wid you an&rsquo; pestah you wid my chattah, Brothah Hayward,&rdquo; and at the next corner Isaac Middleton turned off and went his way, with a cheery &ldquo;so long, may de Lawd set wid you in yo&rsquo; meddertations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So long,&rdquo; said his pastor hastily. Then he did what would be strange in any man, but seemed stranger in so virtuous a minister. He checked his hasty pace, and, after furtively watching Middleton out of sight, turned and retraced his steps in a direction exactly opposite to the one in which he had been going, and toward the cottage of the very Sister Griggs concerning whose charms the minister&rsquo;s parishioner had held forth.</p>
<p>
	It was late, but the pastor knew that the woman whom he sought was industrious and often worked late, and with ever increasing eagerness he hurried on. He was fully rewarded for his perseverance when the light from the window of his intended hostess gleamed upon him, and when she stood in the full glow of it as the door opened in answer to his knock.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;La, Brothah Hayward, ef it ain&rsquo;t you; howdy; come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Howdy, howdy, Sistah Griggs, how you come on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;s des tol&rsquo;able,&rdquo; industriously dusting a chair. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s yo&rsquo;se&rsquo;f?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;s right smaht, thankee ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;W&rsquo;y, Brothah Hayward, ain&rsquo;t you los&rsquo; down in dis paht of de town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No, indeed, Sistah Griggs, de shep&rsquo;erd ain&rsquo;t nevah los&rsquo; no whaih dey&rsquo;s any of de flock.&rdquo; Then looking around the room at the piles of ironed clothes, he added: &ldquo;You sutny is a indust&rsquo;ious ooman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I was des &lsquo;bout finishin&rsquo; up some i&rsquo;onin&rsquo; I had fu&rsquo; de white folks,&rdquo; smiled Sister Griggs, taking down her ironing&ndash;board and resting it in the corner. &ldquo;Allus when I gits thoo my wo&rsquo;k at nights I&rsquo;s putty well tiahed out an&rsquo; has to eat a snack; set by, Brothah Hayward, while I fixes us a bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;La, sistah, hit don&rsquo;t skacely seem right fu&rsquo; me to be a&ndash;comin&rsquo; in hyeah lettin&rsquo; you fix fu&rsquo; me at dis time o&rsquo; night, an&rsquo; you mighty nigh tuckahed out, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Tsch, Brothah Hayward, taint no ha&rsquo;dah lookin&rsquo; out fu&rsquo; two dan it is lookin&rsquo; out fu&rsquo; one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Hayward flashed a quick upward glance at his hostess&rsquo; face and then repeated slowly, &ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m, dat sutny is de trufe. I ain&rsquo;t nevah t&rsquo;ought o&rsquo; that befo&rsquo;. Hit ain&rsquo;t no ha&rsquo;dah lookin&rsquo; out fu&rsquo; two dan hit is fu&rsquo; one,&rdquo;nd though he was usually an incessant talker, he lapsed into a brown study.</p>
<p>
	Be it known that the Rev. Mr. Hayward was a man of a very level head, and that his bachelorhood was a matter of economy. He had long considered matrimony in the light of a most desirable estate, but one which he feared to embrace until the rewards for his labours began looking up a little better. But now the matter was being presented to him in an entirely different light. &ldquo;Hit ain&rsquo;t no ha&rsquo;dah lookin&rsquo; out fu&rsquo; two dan fu&rsquo; one.&rdquo; Might that not be the truth after all. One had to have food. It would take very little more to do for two. One had to have a home to live in. The same house would shelter two. One had to wear clothes. Well, now, there came the rub. But he thought of donation parties, and smiled. Instead of being an extravagance, might not this union of two beings be an economy? Somebody to cook the food, somebody to keep the house, and somebody to mend the clothes.</p>
<p>
	His reverie was broken in upon by Sally Griggs&rsquo; voice. &ldquo;Hit do seem lak you mighty deep in t&rsquo;ought dis evenin&rsquo;, Brothah Hayward. I done spoke to you twicet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Scuse me, Sistah Griggs, my min&rsquo; has been mighty deeply &lsquo;sorbed in a little mattah o&rsquo; doctrine. What you say to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I say set up to the table an&rsquo; have a bite to eat; tain&rsquo;t much, but &lsquo;sich ez I have&rsquo;&mdash;you know what de &lsquo;postle said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The preacher&rsquo;s eyes glistened as they took in the well&ndash;filled board. There was fervour in the blessing which he asked that made amends for its brevity. Then he fell to.</p>
<p>
	Isaac Middleton was right. This woman was a genius among cooks. Isaac Middleton was also wrong. He, a layman, had no right to raise his eyes to her. She was the prize of the elect, not the quarry of any chance pursuer. As he ate and talked, his admiration for Sally grew as did his indignation at Middleton&rsquo;s presumption.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile the fair one plied him with delicacies, and paid deferential attention whenever he opened his mouth to give vent to an opinion. An admirable wife she would make, indeed.</p>
<p>
	At last supper was over and his chair pushed back from the table. With a long sigh of content, he stretched his long legs, tilted back and said: &ldquo;Well, you done settled de case ez fur ez I is concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What dat, Brothah Hayward?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, I do&rsquo; know&rsquo;s I&rsquo;s quite prepahed to tell you yit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Hyeah now, don&rsquo; you remembah ol&rsquo; Mis&rsquo; Eve? Taint nevah right to git a lady&rsquo;s cur&rsquo;osity riz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, nemmine, nemmine, I ain&rsquo;t gwine keep yo&rsquo; cur&rsquo;osity up long. You see, Sistah Griggs, you done &lsquo;lucidated one p&rsquo;int to me dis night dat meks it plumb needful fu&rsquo; me to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She was looking at him with wide open eyes of expectation.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You made de &lsquo;emark to&ndash;night, dat it ain&rsquo;t no ha&rsquo;dah lookin&rsquo; out aftah two dan one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, Brothah Hayward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Sistah Sally, I reckernizes dat, an&rsquo; I want to know ef you won&rsquo;t let me look out aftah we two? Will you ma&rsquo;y me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She picked nervously at her apron, and her eyes sought the floor modestly as she answered, &ldquo;Why, Brothah Hayward, I ain&rsquo;t fittin&rsquo; fu&rsquo; no sich eddicated man ez you. S&rsquo;posin&rsquo; you&rsquo;d git to be pu&rsquo;sidin&rsquo; elder, er bishop, er somp&rsquo;n&rsquo; er othah, whaih&rsquo;d I be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	He waved his hand magnanimously. &ldquo;Sistah Griggs, Sally, whatevah high place I may be fo&rsquo;destined to I shall tek my wife up wid me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	This was enough, and with her hearty yes, the Rev. Mr. Hayward had Sister Sally close in his clerical arms. They were not through their mutual felicitations, which were indeed so enthusiastic as to drown the sound of a knocking at the door and the ominous scraping of feet, when the door opened to admit Isaac Middleton, just as the preacher was imprinting a very decided kiss upon his fiancee&rsquo;s cheek.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Wha&rsquo;&mdash;wha&rsquo;&rdquo; exclaimed Middleton.</p>
<p>
	The preacher turned. &ldquo;Dat you, Isaac?&rdquo; he said complacently. &ldquo;You must &lsquo;scuse ouah &lsquo;pearance, we des got ingaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The fair Sally blushed unseen.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Isaac. &ldquo;Ingaged, aftah what I tol&rsquo; you to&ndash;night.&rdquo; His face was a thundercloud.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes, suh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;An&rsquo; is dat de way you stan&rsquo; up fu&rsquo; fo&rsquo;destination?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	This time it was the preacher&rsquo;s turn to darken angrily as he replied, &ldquo;Look a&ndash;hyeah, Ike Middleton, all I got to say to you is dat whenevah a lady cook to please me lak dis lady do, an&rsquo; whenevah I love one lak I love huh, an&rsquo; she seems to love me back, I&rsquo;s a&ndash;gwine to pop de question to huh, fo&rsquo;destination er no fo&rsquo;destination, so dah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The moment was pregnant with tragic possibilities. The lady still stood with bowed head, but her hand had stolen into her minister&rsquo;s. Isaac paused, and the situation overwhelmed him. Crushed with anger and defeat he turned toward the door.</p>
<p>
	On the threshold he paused again to say, &ldquo;Well, all I got to say to you, Hayward, don&rsquo; you nevah talk to me no mor&rsquo; nuffin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout doctrine!&rdquo;</p>
