                <p>
	There was a great commotion in that part of town which was known as &ldquo;Little Africa,&rdquo; and the cause of it was not far to seek. Contrary to the usual thing, this cause was not an excursion down the river, nor a revival, baptising, nor an Emancipation Day celebration. None of these was it that had aroused the denizens of &ldquo;Little Africa,&rdquo; and kept them talking across the street from window to window, from door to door, through alley gates, over backyard fences, where they stood loud&ndash;mouthed and arms akimboed among laden clothes lines. No, the cause of it all was that Erastus Smith, Aunt Mandy Smith&rsquo;s boy, who had gone away from home several years before, and who, rumour said, had become a great man, was coming back, and &ldquo;Little Africa,&rdquo; from Douglass Street to Cat Alley, was prepared to be dazzled. So few of those who had been born within the mile radius which was &ldquo;Little Africa&rdquo; went out into the great world and came into contact with the larger humanity that when one did he became a man set apart. And when, besides, he went into a great city and worked for a lawyer whose name was known the country over, the place of his birth had all the more reason to feel proud of her son.</p>
<p>
	So there was much talk across the dirty little streets, and Aunt Mandy&rsquo;s small house found itself all of a sudden a very popular resort. The old women held Erastus up as an example to their sons. The old men told what they might have done had they had his chance. The young men cursed him, and the young girls giggled and waited.</p>
<p>
	It was about an hour before the time of the arrival of Erastus, and the neighbours had thinned out one by one with a delicacy rather surprising in them, in order that the old lady might be alone with her boy for the first few minutes. Only one remained to help put the finishing touches to the two little rooms which Mrs. Smith called home, and to the preparations for the great dinner. The old woman wiped her eyes as she said to her companion, &ldquo;Hit do seem a speshul blessin&rsquo;, Lizy, dat I been spaihed to see dat chile once mo&rsquo; in de flesh. He sholy was mighty nigh to my hea&rsquo;t, an&rsquo; w&rsquo;en he went erway, I thought it &lsquo;ud kill me. But I kin see now dat hit uz all fu&rsquo; de bes&rsquo;. Think o&rsquo; &lsquo;Rastus comin&rsquo; home, er big man! Who&rsquo;d evah &lsquo;specked dat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Law, Mis&rsquo; Smif, you sholy is got reason to be mighty thankful. Des&rsquo; look how many young men dere is in dis town what ain&rsquo;t nevah been no &lsquo;count to dey pa&rsquo;ents, ner anybody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s onexpected, Lizy, an&rsquo; hit&rsquo;s &lsquo;spected. &lsquo;Rastus allus wuz a wonnerful chil&rsquo;, an&rsquo; de way he tuk to work an&rsquo; study kin&rsquo; o&rsquo; promised something f&rsquo;om de commencement, an&rsquo; I &lsquo;lowed mebbe he tu&rsquo;n out a preachah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Tush! yo&rsquo; kin thank yo&rsquo; stahs he didn&rsquo;t tu&rsquo;n out no preachah. Preachahs ain&rsquo;t no bettah den anybody else dese days. Dey des go roun&rsquo; tellin&rsquo; dey lies an&rsquo; eatin&rsquo; de whiders an&rsquo; orphins out o&rsquo; house an&rsquo; home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, mebbe hit&rsquo;s bes&rsquo; he didn&rsquo; tu&rsquo;n out dat way. But f&rsquo;om de way he used to stan&rsquo; on de chaih an&rsquo; &lsquo;zort w&rsquo;en he was a little boy, I thought hit was des what he &lsquo;ud tu&rsquo;n out. O&rsquo; co&rsquo;se, being&rsquo; in a law office is des as pervidin&rsquo;, but somehow hit do seem mo&rsquo; worl&rsquo;y.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you de preachahs is ez worldly ez anybody else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes, yes, dat&rsquo;s right, but den &lsquo;Rastus, he had de eddication, fo&rsquo; he had gone thoo de Third Readah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Just then the gate creaked, and a little brown&ndash;faced girl, with large, mild eyes, pushed open the door and came shyly in.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Hyeah&rsquo;s some flowahs, Mis&rsquo; Smif,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought mebbe you might like to decorate &lsquo;Rastus&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; and she wiped the confusion from her face with her apron.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;La, chil&rsquo;, thankee. Dese is mighty pu&rsquo;tty posies.&rdquo; These were the laurels which Sally Martin had brought to lay at the feet of her home&ndash;coming hero. No one in Cat Alley but that queer, quiet little girl would have thought of decorating anybody&rsquo;s room with flowers, but she had peculiar notions.</p>
<p>
	In the old days, when they were children, and before Erastus had gone away to become great, they had gone up and down together along the byways of their locality, and had loved as children love. Later, when Erastus began keeping company, it was upon Sally that he bestowed his affections. No one, not even her mother, knew how she had waited for him all these years that he had been gone, few in reality, but so long and so many to her.</p>
<p>
	And now he was coming home. She scorched something in the ironing that day because tears of joy were blinding her eyes. Her thoughts were busy with the meeting that was to be. She had a brand new dress for the occasion&mdash;a lawn, with dark blue dots, and a blue sash&mdash;and there was a new hat, wonderful with the flowers of summer, and for both of them she had spent her hard&ndash;earned savings, because she wished to be radiant in the eyes of the man who loved her.</p>
<p>
	Of course, Erastus had not written her; but he must have been busy, and writing was hard work. She knew that herself, and realised it all the more as she penned the loving little scrawls which at first she used to send him. Now they would not have to do any writing any more; they could say what they wanted to each other. He was coming home at last, and she had waited long.</p>
<p>
	They paint angels with shining faces and halos, but for real radiance one should have looked into the dark eyes of Sally as she sped home after her contribution to her lover&rsquo;s reception.</p>
<p>
	When the last one of the neighbours had gone Aunt Mandy sat down to rest herself and to await the great event. She had not sat there long before the gate creaked. She arose and hastened to the window. A young man was coming down the path. Was that &lsquo;Rastus? Could that be her &lsquo;Rastus, that gorgeous creature with the shiny shoes and the nobby suit and the carelessly&ndash;swung cane? But he was knocking at her door, and she opened it and took him into her arms.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Why, howdy, honey, howdy; hit do beat all to see you agin, a great big, grown&ndash;up man. You&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo; des&rsquo; lak one o&rsquo; de big folks up in town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Erastus submitted to her endearments with a somewhat condescending grace, as who should say, &ldquo;Well, poor old fool, let her go on this time; she doesn&rsquo;t know any better.&rdquo; He smiled superiorly when the old woman wept glad tears, as mothers have a way of doing over returned sons, however great fools these sons may be. She set him down to the dinner which she had prepared for him, and with loving patience drew from his pompous and reluctant lips some of the story of his doings and some little word about the places he had seen.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said, crossing his legs, &ldquo;as soon as Mr. Carrington saw that I was pretty bright, he took me right up and gave me a good job, and I have been working for him right straight along for seven years now. Of course, it don&rsquo;t do to let white folks know all you&rsquo;re thinking; but I have kept my ears and my eyes right open, and I guess I know just about as much about law as he does himself. When I save up a little more I&rsquo;m going to put on the finishing touches and hang out my shingle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you nevah think no mo&rsquo; &lsquo;bout bein&rsquo; a preachah, &lsquo;Rastus?&rdquo; his mother asked.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Haw, haw! Preachah? Well, I guess not; no preaching in mine; there&rsquo;s nothing in it. In law you always have a chance to get into politics and be the president of your ward club or something like that, and from that on it&rsquo;s an easy matter to go on up. You can trust me to know the wires.&rdquo; And so the tenor of his boastful talk ran on, his mother a little bit awed and not altogether satisfied with the new &lsquo;Rastus that had returned to her.</p>
<p>
	He did not stay in long that evening, although his mother told him some of the neighbours were going to drop in. He said he wanted to go about and see something of the town. He paused just long enough to glance at the flowers in his room, and to his mother&rsquo;s remark, &ldquo;Sally Ma&rsquo;tin brung dem in,&rdquo; he returned answer, &ldquo;Who on earth is Sally Martin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Why, &lsquo;Rastus,&rdquo; exclaimed his mother, &ldquo;does yo&rsquo; &lsquo;tend lak yo&rsquo; don&rsquo;t &lsquo;member little Sally Ma&rsquo;tin yo&rsquo; used to go wid almos&rsquo; f&rsquo;om de time you was babies? W&rsquo;y, I&rsquo;m s&rsquo;prised at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;She has slipped my mind,&rdquo; said the young man.</p>
<p>
	For a long while the neighbours who had come and Aunt Mandy sat up to wait for Erastus, but he did not come in until the last one was gone. In fact, he did not get in until nearly four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, looking a little weak, but at least in the best of spirits, and he vouchsafed to his waiting mother the remark that &ldquo;the little old town wasn&rsquo;t so bad, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Aunt Mandy preferred the request that she had had in mind for some time, that he would go to church the next day, and he consented, because his trunk had come.</p>
<p>
	It was a glorious Sunday morning, and the old lady was very proud in her stiff gingham dress as she saw her son come into the room arrayed in his long coat, shiny hat, and shinier shoes. Well, if it was true that he was changed, he was still her &lsquo;Rastus, and a great comfort to her. There was no vanity about the old woman, but she paused before the glass a longer time than usual, settling her bonnet strings, for she must look right, she told herself, to walk to church with that elegant son of hers. When he was all ready, with cane in hand, and she was pausing with the key in the door, he said, &ldquo;Just walk on, mother, I&rsquo;ll catch you in a minute or two.&rdquo; She went on and left him.</p>
<p>
	He did not catch her that morning on her way to church, and it was a sore disappointment, but it was somewhat compensated for when she saw him stalking into the chapel in all his glory, and every head in the house turned to behold him.</p>
<p>
	There was one other woman in &ldquo;Little Africa&rdquo; that morning who stopped for a longer time than usual before her looking&ndash;glass and who had never found her bonnet strings quite so refractory before. In spite of the vexation of flowers that wouldn&rsquo;t settle and ribbons that wouldn&rsquo;t tie, a very glad face looked back at Sally Martin from her little mirror. She was going to see &lsquo;Rastus, &lsquo;Rastus of the old days in which they used to walk hand in hand. He had told her when he went away that some day he would come back and marry her. Her heart fluttered hotly under her dotted lawn, and it took another application of the chamois to take the perspiration from her face. People had laughed at her, but that morning she would be vindicated. He would walk home with her before the whole church. Already she saw him bowing before her, hat in hand, and heard the set phrase, &ldquo;May I have the pleasure of your company home?&rdquo; and she saw herself sailing away upon his arm.</p>
<p>
	She was very happy as she sat in church that morning, as happy as Mrs. Smith herself, and as proud when she saw the object of her affections swinging up the aisle to the collection table, and from the ring she knew that it could not be less than a half dollar that he put in.</p>
<p>
	There was a special note of praise in her voice as she joined in singing the doxology that morning, and her heart kept quivering and fluttering like a frightened bird as the people gathered in groups, chattering and shaking hands, and he drew nearer to her. Now they were almost together; in a moment their eyes would meet. Her breath came quickly; he had looked at her, surely he must have seen her. His mother was just behind him, and he did not speak. Maybe she had changed, maybe he had forgotten her. An unaccustomed boldness took possession of her, and she determined that she would not be overlooked. She pressed forward. She saw his mother take his arm and heard her whisper, &ldquo;Dere&rsquo;s Sally Ma&rsquo;tin&rdquo; this time, and she knew that he looked at her.

In the friendly shelter of her room she took off her gay attire and laid it away, and then sat down at the window and looked dully out. For her, the light of day had gone out.</p>
