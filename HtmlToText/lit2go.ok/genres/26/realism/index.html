	Clotel; or, The President&#39;s Daughter is a novel by William Wells Brown (1815 &ndash; 1884), a fugitive from slavery and abolitionist and was published in London, England in December 1853. It gained notoriety amid the unconfirmed rumors regarding Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings. Brown was still considered someone else&#39;s legal property within the borders of the United States at the time of its publication. It is considered to be the first novel written by an African American. The book follows the experiences of three generations of women during slavery.</p>
<p>
	Brown used the injustices of slavery to demonstrate the destructive effects it had on the African American family, most significantly the so&ndash;called tragic mulatto. Brown had escaped from slavery in Kentucky while still in his youth, and became active on the anti&ndash;slavery circuit.</p>            </article>

              </h4>
              <p>
	<em>The Jungle</em> is a novel by American author and socialist Upton Sinclair. It describes the life of a family of Lithuanian immigrants working in Chicago&rsquo;s Union Stock Yards at the beginning of the 20th century. The novel depicts in harsh tones the poverty, complete absence of social security, scandalous living and working conditions, and generally utter hopelessness prevalent among the have-nots, which is contrasted with the deeply-rooted corruption on the part of the haves. The sad state of turn-of-the-century labor is placed front and center for the American public to see suggesting that something needed to be changed to get rid of American &ldquo;wage slavery&rdquo;. The novel is also an important example of the &ldquo;muckraking&rdquo; tradition begun by journalists such as Jacob Riis. Sinclair wanted to show how the mainstream parties of American politics, already being tied into the industrial-capitalist machine, offered little means for progressive change. As such the book is deeply supportive of values and criticisms held by Communism, a movement still in its infancy at the time.</p>            </article>

	<em>The Red Badge of Courage</em> is an impressionistic novel by Stephen Crane about the meaning of courage, as it is narrated by Henry Fleming, a recruit in the American Civil War. It is one of the most influential American war stories ever written even though the author was born after the war and had never seen battle himself. Crane met and spoke with a number of veterans as a student and he created what is widely regarded as an unusually realistic depiction of a young man in battle.</p>            </article>
