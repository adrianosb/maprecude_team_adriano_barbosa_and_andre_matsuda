	<em>Macbeth</em> is among the best known of William Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays, as well as his shortest surviving tragedy. It is frequently performed at professional and community theatres around the world. The play, loosely based upon the historical account of King Macbeth of Scotland by Raphael Holinshed and the Scottish philosopher Hector Boece, is often seen as an archetypal tale of the dangers of the lust for power and betrayal of friends. It has frequently been adapted. In the theatrical world, many superstitions are associated with &ldquo;Macbeth,&rdquo; all connected with the belief that the play is somehow &ldquo;cursed.&rdquo; Many actors will not mention the name of the play aloud, referring to it as &ldquo;the Scottish Play&rdquo;.</p>            </article>

	<em>The Merchant of Venice</em> is one of William Shakespeare&#39;s best-known plays, written sometime between 1596 and 1598. Although it is sometimes classified as a comedy and shares certain aspects with the other romantic comedies, it is perhaps more remembered for its dramatic scenes (particularly the trial scene) and is best known for its portrayal of the Jew Shylock, which has raised questions of anti-semitism.</p>            </article>

	<em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is an early tragedy by William Shakespeare about two teenage &ldquo;star-cross&rsquo;d lovers&rdquo; whose &ldquo;untimely deaths&rdquo; ultimately unite their feuding households. The play has been highly praised by literary critics for its language and dramatic effect. It was among Shakespeare&rsquo;s most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed plays. Romeo and Juliet are widely represented as archetypal young lovers.</p>            </article>
