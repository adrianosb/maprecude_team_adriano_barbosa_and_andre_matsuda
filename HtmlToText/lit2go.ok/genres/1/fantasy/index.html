	<em>Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</em> is a work of children&rsquo;s literature by the English mathematician and author, Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, written under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit-hole into a fantasy realm populated by talking playing cards and anthropomorphic creatures. The tale is fraught with satirical allusions to Dodgson&rsquo;s friends and to the lessons that British schoolchildren were expected to memorize. The Wonderland described in the tale plays with logic in ways that has made the story of lasting popularity with children as well as adults. The book is often referred to by the abbreviated title <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. This alternate title was popularized by the numerous film and television adaptations of the story produced over the years. Some printings of this title contain both <em>Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</em> and its sequel <em>Through the Looking-Glass</em>, and <em>What Alice Found There</em>.</p>

	The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle was the second of Hugh Lofting&#39;s Doctor Dolittle books to be published, coming out in 1922. It is nearly four times longer than its predecessor and the writing style is pitched at a more mature audience. The scope of the novel is vast; it is divided into six parts and the illustrations are also more sophisticated. It won the Newbery Medal for 1923.</p>            </article>
