	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is set in the 1840&#39;s in the fictitious town of St. Petersburg, Missouri, where Tom lives with his deceased mother&#39;s sister, Aunt Polly, and his half-brother, Sid. After Tom plays hooky from school, he is made to whitewash Aunt Polly&#39;s fence as punishment, but persuades his friends to do it for him.</p>
<p>
	Tom&#39;s real trouble begins when he and Huck Finn witness a murder committed by Injun Joe. They swear to never tell, and the wrong man, Muff Potter, is accused of the crime. Tom, Huck, and a friend run away to be pirates, but become aware that the whole town is searching for their bodies. Each of the boys make an appearance at their own funerals, where they are greeted with open arms. As Muff Potter&#39;s trial begins, Tom is overcome with guilt and testifies against Injun Joe, who quickly flees the courtroom.</p>
<p>
	Later, on a class field trip to a cave, Tom and his love interest, Becky Thatcher, get lost. As they run out of food and candles searching for a way out, Tom and Becky come upon Injun Joe, who is using the cave as a hideout. Tom finds a way out just as the search party is giving up. The town rejoices and Judge Thatcher, Becky&#39;s father, has the cave sealed, unknowingly trapping Injun Joe inside where he starves to death.</p>            </article>

              <p>
	The Call of the Wild is a novel by American writer Jack London. The plot concerns a previously domesticated happy dog named Buck, whose primordial instincts return after a series of events leads to his serving as a sled dog in the Yukon during the 19th-century Klondike Gold Rush, in which sled dogs were bought at generous prices.</p>
<p>
	Published in 1903, The Call of the Wild is London&#39;s most-read book, and it is generally considered his best, the masterpiece of his so-called &quot;early period&quot;. Because the protagonist is a dog, it is sometimes classified as a juvenile novel, suitable for children, but it is dark in tone and contains numerous scenes of cruelty and violence.</p>
<p>
	London followed the book in 1906 with White Fang, a companion novel with many similar plot elements and themes as Call of the Wild, although following a mirror image plot in which a wild wolf becomes civilized by a mining expert from San Francisco named Weedon Scott.</p>            </article>
