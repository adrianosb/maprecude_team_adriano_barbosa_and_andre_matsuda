<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N&#39;a plus rien a dissimuler.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quinault&mdash;Atys.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;Of my country and of my family I have little to say. Ill usage and&ndash;length of years have driven me from the one, and estranged me from the&ndash;other. Hereditary wealth afforded me an education of no common order,&ndash;and a contemplative turn of mind enabled me to methodize the stores&ndash;which early study very diligently garnered up.&mdash;Beyond all things,&ndash;the study of the German moralists gave me great delight; not from any&ndash;ill&ndash;advised admiration of their eloquent madness, but from the ease with&ndash;which my habits of rigid thought enabled me to detect their falsities.&ndash;I have often been reproached with the aridity of my genius; a deficiency&ndash;of imagination has been imputed to me as a crime; and the Pyrrhonism&ndash;of my opinions has at all times rendered me notorious. Indeed, a strong&ndash;relish for physical philosophy has, I fear, tinctured my mind with&ndash;a very common error of this age&mdash;I mean the habit of referring&ndash;occurrences, even the least susceptible of such reference, to the&ndash;principles of that science. Upon the whole, no person could be less&ndash;liable than myself to be led away from the severe precincts of truth by&ndash;the ignes fatui of superstition. I have thought proper to premise thus&ndash;much, lest the incredible tale I have to tell should be considered&ndash;rather the raving of a crude imagination, than the positive experience&ndash;of a mind to which the reveries of fancy have been a dead letter and a&ndash;nullity.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;After many years spent in foreign travel, I sailed in the year 18&mdash;, &ndash;from the port of Batavia, in the rich and populous island of Java, on&ndash;a voyage to the Archipelago of the Sunda islands. I went as&ndash;passenger&mdash;having no other inducement than a kind of nervous&ndash;restlessness which haunted me as a fiend.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;Our vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred tons,&ndash;copper&ndash;fastened, and built at Bombay of Malabar teak. She was freighted&ndash;with cotton&ndash;wool and oil, from the Lachadive islands. We had also on&ndash;board coir, jaggeree, ghee, cocoa&ndash;nuts, and a few cases of opium. The&ndash;stowage was clumsily done, and the vessel consequently crank.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;We got under way with a mere breath of wind, and for many days stood&ndash;along the eastern coast of Java, without any other incident to beguile&ndash;the monotony of our course than the occasional meeting with some of the&ndash;small grabs of the Archipelago to which we were bound.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;One evening, leaning over the taffrail, I observed a very singular,&ndash;isolated cloud, to the N.W. It was remarkable, as well for its color, as&ndash;from its being the first we had seen since our departure from Batavia.&ndash;I watched it attentively until sunset, when it spread all at once to&ndash;the eastward and westward, girting in the horizon with a narrow strip&ndash;of vapor, and looking like a long line of low beach. My notice was soon&ndash;afterwards attracted by the dusky&ndash;red appearance of the moon, and the&ndash;peculiar character of the sea. The latter was undergoing a rapid change,&ndash;and the water seemed more than usually transparent. Although I could&ndash;distinctly see the bottom, yet, heaving the lead, I found the ship in&ndash;fifteen fathoms. The air now became intolerably hot, and was loaded with&ndash;spiral exhalations similar to those arising from heat iron. As night&ndash;came on, every breath of wind died away, an more entire calm it is&ndash;impossible to conceive. The flame of a candle burned upon the poop&ndash;without the least perceptible motion, and a long hair, held between the&ndash;finger and thumb, hung without the possibility of detecting a vibration.&ndash;However, as the captain said he could perceive no indication of danger,&ndash;and as we were drifting in bodily to shore, he ordered the sails to&ndash;be furled, and the anchor let go. No watch was set, and the crew,&ndash;consisting principally of Malays, stretched themselves deliberately upon&ndash;deck. I went below&mdash;not without a full presentiment of evil. Indeed,&ndash;every appearance warranted me in apprehending a Simoom. I told the&ndash;captain my fears; but he paid no attention to what I said, and left me&ndash;without deigning to give a reply. My uneasiness, however, prevented me&ndash;from sleeping, and about midnight I went upon deck.&mdash;As I placed my foot&ndash;upon the upper step of the companion&ndash;ladder, I was startled by a&ndash;loud, humming noise, like that occasioned by the rapid revolution of a&ndash;mill&ndash;wheel, and before I could ascertain its meaning, I found the ship&ndash;quivering to its centre. In the next instant, a wilderness of foam&ndash;hurled us upon our beam&ndash;ends, and, rushing over us fore and aft, swept&ndash;the entire decks from stem to stern.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;The extreme fury of the blast proved, in a great measure, the salvation&ndash;of the ship. Although completely water&ndash;logged, yet, as her masts had&ndash;gone by the board, she rose, after a minute, heavily from the sea, and,&ndash;staggering awhile beneath the immense pressure of the tempest, finally&ndash;righted.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;By what miracle I escaped destruction, it is impossible to say. Stunned&ndash;by the shock of the water, I found myself, upon recovery, jammed in&ndash;between the stern&ndash;post and rudder. With great difficulty I gained my&ndash;feet, and looking dizzily around, was, at first, struck with the idea of&ndash;our being among breakers; so terrific, beyond the wildest imagination,&ndash;was the whirlpool of mountainous and foaming ocean within which we were&ndash;engulfed. After a while, I heard the voice of an old Swede, who had&ndash;shipped with us at the moment of our leaving port. I hallooed to&ndash;him with all my strength, and presently he came reeling aft. We soon&ndash;discovered that we were the sole survivors of the accident. All on deck,&ndash;with the exception of ourselves, had been swept overboard;&mdash;the captain&ndash;and mates must have perished as they slept, for the cabins were deluged&ndash;with water. Without assistance, we could expect to do little for the&ndash;security of the ship, and our exertions were at first paralyzed by the&ndash;momentary expectation of going down. Our cable had, of course, parted&ndash;like pack&ndash;thread, at the first breath of the hurricane, or we should&ndash;have been instantaneously overwhelmed. We scudded with frightful&ndash;velocity before the sea, and the water made clear breaches over us. The&ndash;frame&ndash;work of our stern was shattered excessively, and, in almost every&ndash;respect, we had received considerable injury; but to our extreme Joy we&ndash;found the pumps unchoked, and that we had made no great shifting of&ndash;our ballast. The main fury of the blast had already blown over, and we&ndash;apprehended little danger from the violence of the wind; but we looked&ndash;forward to its total cessation with dismay; well believing, that, in our&ndash;shattered condition, we should inevitably perish in the tremendous swell&ndash;which would ensue. But this very just apprehension seemed by no means&ndash;likely to be soon verified. For five entire days and nights&mdash;during&ndash;which our only subsistence was a small quantity of jaggeree, procured&ndash;with great difficulty from the forecastle&mdash;the hulk flew at a rate&ndash;defying computation, before rapidly succeeding flaws of wind, which,&ndash;without equalling the first violence of the Simoom, were still more&ndash;terrific than any tempest I had before encountered. Our course for the&ndash;first four days was, with trifling variations, S.E. and by S.; and we&ndash;must have run down the coast of New Holland.&mdash;On the fifth day the cold&ndash;became extreme, although the wind had hauled round a point more to the&ndash;northward.&mdash;The sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre, and clambered a&ndash;very few degrees above the horizon&mdash;emitting no decisive light.&mdash;There&ndash;were no clouds apparent, yet the wind was upon the increase, and blew&ndash;with a fitful and unsteady fury. About noon, as nearly as we could&ndash;guess, our attention was again arrested by the appearance of the sun.&ndash;It gave out no light, properly so called, but a dull and sullen glow&ndash;without reflection, as if all its rays were polarized. Just before&ndash;sinking within the turgid sea, its central fires suddenly went out, as&ndash;if hurriedly extinguished by some unaccountable power. It was a dim,&ndash;sliver&ndash;like rim, alone, as it rushed down the unfathomable ocean.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;We waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth day&mdash;that day to me&ndash;has not arrived&mdash;to the Swede, never did arrive. Thenceforward we were&ndash;enshrouded in patchy darkness, so that we could not have seen an object&ndash;at twenty paces from the ship. Eternal night continued to envelop us,&ndash;all unrelieved by the phosphoric sea&ndash;brilliancy to which we had been&ndash;accustomed in the tropics. We observed too, that, although the tempest&ndash;continued to rage with unabated violence, there was no longer to be&ndash;discovered the usual appearance of surf, or foam, which had hitherto&ndash;attended us. All around were horror, and thick gloom, and a black&ndash;sweltering desert of ebony.&mdash;Superstitious terror crept by degrees into&ndash;the spirit of the old Swede, and my own soul was wrapped up in silent&ndash;wonder. We neglected all care of the ship, as worse than useless, and&ndash;securing ourselves, as well as possible, to the stump of the mizen&ndash;mast,&ndash;looked out bitterly into the world of ocean. We had no means of&ndash;calculating time, nor could we form any guess of our situation. We were,&ndash;however, well aware of having made farther to the southward than any&ndash;previous navigators, and felt great amazement at not meeting with the&ndash;usual impediments of ice. In the meantime every moment threatened to be&ndash;our last&mdash;every mountainous billow hurried to overwhelm us. The swell&ndash;surpassed anything I had imagined possible, and that we were not&ndash;instantly buried is a miracle. My companion spoke of the lightness of&ndash;our cargo, and reminded me of the excellent qualities of our ship; but&ndash;I could not help feeling the utter hopelessness of hope itself, and&ndash;prepared myself gloomily for that death which I thought nothing could&ndash;defer beyond an hour, as, with every knot of way the ship made,&ndash;the swelling of the black stupendous seas became more dismally&ndash;appalling. At times we gasped for breath at an elevation beyond the&ndash;albatross&mdash;at times became dizzy with the velocity of our descent into&ndash;some watery hell, where the air grew stagnant, and no sound disturbed&ndash;the slumbers of the kraken.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;We were at the bottom of one of these abysses, when a quick scream&ndash;from my companion broke fearfully upon the night. &quot;See! see!&quot; cried he,&ndash;shrieking in my ears, &quot;Almighty God! see! see!&quot; As he spoke, I became&ndash;aware of a dull, sullen glare of red light which streamed down the sides&ndash;of the vast chasm where we lay, and threw a fitful brilliancy upon our&ndash;deck. Casting my eyes upwards, I beheld a spectacle which froze the&ndash;current of my blood. At a terrific height directly above us, and upon&ndash;the very verge of the precipitous descent, hovered a gigantic ship of,&ndash;perhaps, four thousand tons. Although upreared upon the summit of a wave&ndash;more than a hundred times her own altitude, her apparent size exceeded&ndash;that of any ship of the line or East Indiaman in existence. Her huge&ndash;hull was of a deep dingy black, unrelieved by any of the customary&ndash;carvings of a ship. A single row of brass cannon protruded from her open&ndash;ports, and dashed from their polished surfaces the fires of innumerable&ndash;battle&ndash;lanterns, which swung to and fro about her rigging. But what&ndash;mainly inspired us with horror and astonishment, was that she bore up&ndash;under a press of sail in the very teeth of that supernatural sea, and of&ndash;that ungovernable hurricane. When we first discovered her, her bows&ndash;were alone to be seen, as she rose slowly from the dim and horrible gulf&ndash;beyond her. For a moment of intense terror she paused upon the giddy&ndash;pinnacle, as if in contemplation of her own sublimity, then trembled and&ndash;tottered, and&mdash;came down.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;At this instant, I know not what sudden self&ndash;possession came over my&ndash;spirit. Staggering as far aft as I could, I awaited fearlessly the ruin&ndash;that was to overwhelm. Our own vessel was at length ceasing from her&ndash;struggles, and sinking with her head to the sea. The shock of the&ndash;descending mass struck her, consequently, in that portion of her frame&ndash;which was already under water, and the inevitable result was to hurl me,&ndash;with irresistible violence, upon the rigging of the stranger.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;As I fell, the ship hove in stays, and went about; and to the confusion&ndash;ensuing I attributed my escape from the notice of the crew. With little&ndash;difficulty I made my way unperceived to the main hatchway, which was&ndash;partially open, and soon found an opportunity of secreting myself in the&ndash;hold. Why I did so I can hardly tell. An indefinite sense of awe, which&ndash;at first sight of the navigators of the ship had taken hold of my mind,&ndash;was perhaps the principle of my concealment. I was unwilling to trust&ndash;myself with a race of people who had offered, to the cursory glance I&ndash;had taken, so many points of vague novelty, doubt, and apprehension. I&ndash;therefore thought proper to contrive a hiding&ndash;place in the hold. This I&ndash;did by removing a small portion of the shifting&ndash;boards, in such a manner&ndash;as to afford me a convenient retreat between the huge timbers of the&ndash;ship.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;I had scarcely completed my work, when a footstep in the hold forced me&ndash;to make use of it. A man passed by my place of concealment with a feeble&ndash;and unsteady gait. I could not see his face, but had an opportunity&ndash;of observing his general appearance. There was about it an evidence of&ndash;great age and infirmity. His knees tottered beneath a load of years, and&ndash;his entire frame quivered under the burthen. He muttered to himself,&ndash;in a low broken tone, some words of a language which I could not&ndash;understand, and groped in a corner among a pile of singular&ndash;looking&ndash;instruments, and decayed charts of navigation. His manner was a wild&ndash;mixture of the peevishness of second childhood, and the solemn dignity&ndash;of a God. He at length went on deck, and I saw him no more.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;A feeling, for which I have no name, has taken possession of my soul&ndash;&mdash;a sensation which will admit of no analysis, to which the lessons of&ndash;bygone times are inadequate, and for which I fear futurity itself&ndash;will offer me no key. To a mind constituted like my own, the latter&ndash;consideration is an evil. I shall never&mdash;I know that I shall&ndash;never&mdash;be satisfied with regard to the nature of my conceptions. Yet it&ndash;is not wonderful that these conceptions are indefinite, since they have&ndash;their origin in sources so utterly novel. A new sense&mdash;a new entity is&ndash;added to my soul.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;It is long since I first trod the deck of this terrible ship, and the&ndash;rays of my destiny are, I think, gathering to a focus. Incomprehensible&ndash;men! Wrapped up in meditations of a kind which I cannot divine, they&ndash;pass me by unnoticed. Concealment is utter folly on my part, for the&ndash;people will not see. It was but just now that I passed directly before&ndash;the eyes of the mate&mdash;it was no long while ago that I ventured into the&ndash;captain&#39;s own private cabin, and took thence the materials with which&ndash;I write, and have written. I shall from time to time continue this&ndash;Journal. It is true that I may not find an opportunity of transmitting&ndash;it to the world, but I will not fall to make the endeavour. At the last&ndash;moment I will enclose the MS. in a bottle, and cast it within the sea.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;An incident has occurred which has given me new room for meditation. Are&ndash;such things the operation of ungoverned Chance? I had ventured upon deck&ndash;and thrown myself down, without attracting any notice, among a pile of&ndash;ratlin&ndash;stuff and old sails in the bottom of the yawl. While musing upon&ndash;the singularity of my fate, I unwittingly daubed with a tar&ndash;brush the&ndash;edges of a neatly&ndash;folded studding&ndash;sail which lay near me on a barrel.&ndash;The studding&ndash;sail is now bent upon the ship, and the thoughtless touches&ndash;of the brush are spread out into the word DISCOVERY.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;I have made many observations lately upon the structure of the vessel.&ndash;Although well armed, she is not, I think, a ship of war. Her rigging,&ndash;build, and general equipment, all negative a supposition of this&ndash;kind. What she is not, I can easily perceive&mdash;what she is I fear it is&ndash;impossible to say. I know not how it is, but in scrutinizing her strange&ndash;model and singular cast of spars, her huge size and overgrown suits&ndash;of canvas, her severely simple bow and antiquated stern, there will&ndash;occasionally flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things, and&ndash;there is always mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection,&ndash;an unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;I have been looking at the timbers of the ship. She is built of a&ndash;material to which I am a stranger. There is a peculiar character about&ndash;the wood which strikes me as rendering it unfit for the purpose to&ndash;which it has been applied. I mean its extreme porousness, considered&ndash;independently by the worm&ndash;eaten condition which is a consequence of&ndash;navigation in these seas, and apart from the rottenness attendant upon&ndash;age. It will appear perhaps an observation somewhat over&ndash;curious, but&ndash;this wood would have every characteristic of Spanish oak, if Spanish oak&ndash;were distended by any unnatural means.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;In reading the above sentence a curious apothegm of an old&ndash;weather&ndash;beaten Dutch navigator comes full upon my recollection. &quot;It&ndash;is as sure,&quot; he was wont to say, when any doubt was entertained of his&ndash;veracity, &quot;as sure as there is a sea where the ship itself will grow in&ndash;bulk like the living body of the seaman.&quot;&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;About an hour ago, I made bold to thrust myself among a group of the&ndash;crew. They paid me no manner of attention, and, although I stood in the&ndash;very midst of them all, seemed utterly unconscious of my presence. Like&ndash;the one I had at first seen in the hold, they all bore about them the&ndash;marks of a hoary old age. Their knees trembled with infirmity; their&ndash;shoulders were bent double with decrepitude; their shrivelled skins&ndash;rattled in the wind; their voices were low, tremulous and broken; their&ndash;eyes glistened with the rheum of years; and their gray hairs streamed&ndash;terribly in the tempest. Around them, on every part of the deck, lay&ndash;scattered mathematical instruments of the most quaint and obsolete&ndash;construction.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;I mentioned some time ago the bending of a studding&ndash;sail. From that&ndash;period the ship, being thrown dead off the wind, has continued her&ndash;terrific course due south, with every rag of canvas packed upon her,&ndash;from her trucks to her lower studding&ndash;sail booms, and rolling every&ndash;moment her top&ndash;gallant yard&ndash;arms into the most appalling hell of water&ndash;which it can enter into the mind of a man to imagine. I have just left&ndash;the deck, where I find it impossible to maintain a footing, although the&ndash;crew seem to experience little inconvenience. It appears to me a miracle&ndash;of miracles that our enormous bulk is not swallowed up at once and&ndash;forever. We are surely doomed to hover continually upon the brink of&ndash;Eternity, without taking a final plunge into the abyss. From billows a&ndash;thousand times more stupendous than any I have ever seen, we glide away&ndash;with the facility of the arrowy sea&ndash;gull; and the colossal waters rear&ndash;their heads above us like demons of the deep, but like demons confined&ndash;to simple threats and forbidden to destroy. I am led to attribute these&ndash;frequent escapes to the only natural cause which can account for such&ndash;effect.&mdash;I must suppose the ship to be within the influence of some&ndash;strong current, or impetuous under&ndash;tow.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;I have seen the captain face to face, and in his own cabin&mdash;but, as I&ndash;expected, he paid me no attention. Although in his appearance there is,&ndash;to a casual observer, nothing which might bespeak him more or less than&ndash;man&ndash;still a feeling of irrepressible reverence and awe mingled with the&ndash;sensation of wonder with which I regarded him. In stature he is nearly&ndash;my own height; that is, about five feet eight inches. He is of a&ndash;well&ndash;knit and compact frame of body, neither robust nor remarkably&ndash;otherwise. But it is the singularity of the expression which reigns upon&ndash;the face&mdash;it is the intense, the wonderful, the thrilling evidence of&ndash;old age, so utter, so extreme, which excites within my spirit a sense&mdash;a&ndash;sentiment ineffable. His forehead, although little wrinkled, seems to&ndash;bear upon it the stamp of a myriad of years.&mdash;His gray hairs are records&ndash;of the past, and his grayer eyes are Sybils of the future. The cabin&ndash;floor was thickly strewn with strange, iron&ndash;clasped folios, and&ndash;mouldering instruments of science, and obsolete long&ndash;forgotten charts.&ndash;His head was bowed down upon his hands, and he pored, with a fiery&ndash;unquiet eye, over a paper which I took to be a commission, and which, at&ndash;all events, bore the signature of a monarch. He muttered to himself, as&ndash;did the first seaman whom I saw in the hold, some low peevish syllables&ndash;of a foreign tongue, and although the speaker was close at my elbow, his&ndash;voice seemed to reach my ears from the distance of a mile.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;The ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of Eld. The crew glide&ndash;to and fro like the ghosts of buried centuries; their eyes have an eager&ndash;and uneasy meaning; and when their fingers fall athwart my path in the&ndash;wild glare of the battle&ndash;lanterns, I feel as I have never felt before,&ndash;although I have been all my life a dealer in antiquities, and have&ndash;imbibed the shadows of fallen columns at Balbec, and Tadmor, and&ndash;Persepolis, until my very soul has become a ruin.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;When I look around me I feel ashamed of my former apprehensions. If I&ndash;trembled at the blast which has hitherto attended us, shall I not stand&ndash;aghast at a warring of wind and ocean, to convey any idea of which&ndash;the words tornado and simoom are trivial and ineffective? All in the&ndash;immediate vicinity of the ship is the blackness of eternal night, and a&ndash;chaos of foamless water; but, about a league on either side of us, may&ndash;be seen, indistinctly and at intervals, stupendous ramparts of ice,&ndash;towering away into the desolate sky, and looking like the walls of the&ndash;universe.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;As I imagined, the ship proves to be in a current; if that appellation&ndash;can properly be given to a tide which, howling and shrieking by the&ndash;white ice, thunders on to the southward with a velocity like the&ndash;headlong dashing of a cataract.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;To conceive the horror of my sensations is, I presume, utterly&ndash;impossible; yet a curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these awful&ndash;regions, predominates even over my despair, and will reconcile me to the&ndash;most hideous aspect of death. It is evident that we are hurrying onwards&ndash;to some exciting knowledge&mdash;some never&ndash;to&ndash;be&ndash;imparted secret, whose&ndash;attainment is destruction. Perhaps this current leads us to the southern&ndash;pole itself. It must be confessed that a supposition apparently so wild&ndash;has every probability in its favor.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;The crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous step; but there is&ndash;upon their countenances an expression more of the eagerness of hope than&ndash;of the apathy of despair.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;In the meantime the wind is still in our poop, and, as we carry a crowd&ndash;of canvas, the ship is at times lifted bodily from out the sea&mdash;Oh,&ndash;horror upon horror! the ice opens suddenly to the right, and to the&ndash;left, and we are whirling dizzily, in immense concentric circles, round&ndash;and round the borders of a gigantic amphitheatre, the summit of whose&ndash;walls is lost in the darkness and the distance. But little time will be&ndash;left me to ponder upon my destiny&mdash;the circles rapidly grow small&mdash;we&ndash;are plunging madly within the grasp of the whirlpool&mdash;and amid a&ndash;roaring, and bellowing, and thundering of ocean and of tempest, the ship&ndash;is quivering, oh God! and&mdash;going down.&ndash;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;NOTE.&mdash;The &quot;MS. Found in a Bottle,&quot; was originally published in 1831,&ndash;and it was not until many years afterwards that I became acquainted with&ndash;the maps of Mercator, in which the ocean is represented as rushing, by&ndash;four mouths, into the (northern) Polar Gulf, to be absorbed into the&ndash;bowels of the earth; the Pole itself being represented by a black rock,&ndash;towering to a prodigious height.&ndash;</p>
