                <p>
	Kind solace in a dying hour!<br />
	Such, father, is not (now) my theme&mdash;<br />
	I will not madly deem that power<br />
	Of Earth may shrive me of the sin<br />
	Unearthly pride hath revell&#39;d in&mdash;<br />
	I have no time to dote or dream:<br />
	You call it hope&mdash; that fire of fire!<br />
	It is but agony of desire:<br />
	If I can hope&mdash; Oh God! I can&mdash;<br />
	Its fount is holier&mdash; more divine&mdash;<br />
	I would not call thee fool, old man,<br />
	But such is not a gift of thine.</p>
<p>
	Know thou the secret of a spirit<br />
	Bow&#39;d from its wild pride into shame.<br />
	O yearning heart! I did inherit<br />
	Thy withering portion with the fame,<br />
	The searing glory which hath shone<br />
	Amid the jewels of my throne,<br />
	Halo of Hell! and with a pain<br />
	Not Hell shall make me fear again&mdash;<br />
	O craving heart, for the lost flowers<br />
	And sunshine of my summer hours!<br />
	The undying voice of that dead time,<br />
	With its interminable chime,<br />
	Rings, in the spirit of a spell,<br />
	Upon thy emptiness&mdash; a knell.</p>
<p>
	I have not always been as now:<br />
	The fever&#39;d diadem on my brow<br />
	I claim&#39;d and won usurpingly&mdash;<br />
	Hath not the same fierce heirdom given<br />
	Rome to the Caesar&mdash; this to me?<br />
	The heritage of a kingly mind,<br />
	And a proud spirit which hath striven<br />
	Triumphantly with human kind.</p>
<p>
	On mountain soil I first drew life:<br />
	The mists of the Taglay have shed<br />
	Nightly their dews upon my head,<br />
	And, I believe, the winged strife<br />
	And tumult of the headlong air<br />
	Have nestled in my very hair.</p>
<p>
	So late from Heaven&mdash; that dew&mdash; it fell<br />
	(Mid dreams of an unholy night)<br />
	Upon me with the touch of Hell,<br />
	While the red flashing of the light<br />
	From clouds that hung, like banners, o&#39;er,<br />
	Appeared to my half&mdash;closing eye<br />
	The pageantry of monarchy,<br />
	And the deep trumpet&mdash;thunder&#39;s roar<br />
	Came hurriedly upon me, telling<br />
	Of human battle, where my voice,<br />
	My own voice, silly child!&mdash; was swelling<br />
	(O! how my spirit would rejoice,<br />
	And leap within me at the cry)<br />
	The battle&mdash;cry of Victory!</p>
<p>
	The rain came down upon my head<br />
	Unshelter&#39;d&mdash; and the heavy wind<br />
	Rendered me mad and deaf and blind.<br />
	It was but man, I thought, who shed<br />
	Laurels upon me: and the rush&mdash;<br />
	The torrent of the chilly air<br />
	Gurgled within my ear the crush<br />
	Of empires&mdash; with the captive&#39;s prayer&mdash;<br />
	The hum of suitors&mdash; and the tone<br />
	Of flattery &#39;round a sovereign&#39;s throne.</p>
<p>
	My passions, from that hapless hour,<br />
	Usurp&#39;d a tyranny which men<br />
	Have deem&#39;d, since I have reach&#39;d to power,<br />
	My innate nature&mdash; be it so:<br />
	But father, there liv&#39;d one who, then,<br />
	Then&mdash; in my boyhood&mdash; when their fire<br />
	Burn&#39;d with a still intenser glow,<br />
	(For passion must, with youth, expire)<br />
	E&#39;en then who knew this iron heart<br />
	In woman&#39;s weakness had a part.</p>
<p>
	I have no words&mdash; alas!&mdash; to tell<br />
	The loveliness of loving well!<br />
	Nor would I now attempt to trace<br />
	The more than beauty of a face<br />
	Whose lineaments, upon my mind,<br />
	Are&mdash; shadows on th&#39; unstable wind:<br />
	Thus I remember having dwelt<br />
	Some page of early lore upon,<br />
	With loitering eye, till I have felt<br />
	The letters&mdash; with their meaning&mdash; melt<br />
	To fantasies&mdash; with none.</p>
<p>
	O, she was worthy of all love!<br />
	Love&mdash; as in infancy was mine&mdash;<br />
	&#39;Twas such as angel minds above<br />
	Might envy; her young heart the shrine<br />
	On which my every hope and thought<br />
	Were incense&mdash; then a goodly gift,<br />
	For they were childish and upright&mdash;<br />
	Pure&mdash; as her young example taught:<br />
	Why did I leave it, and, adrift,<br />
	Trust to the fire within, for light?</p>
<p>
	We grew in age&mdash; and love&mdash; together,<br />
	Roaming the forest, and the wild;<br />
	My breast her shield in wintry weather&mdash;<br />
	And when the friendly sunshine smil&#39;d,<br />
	And she would mark the opening skies,<br />
	I saw no Heaven&mdash; but in her eyes.</p>
<p>
	Young Love&#39;s first lesson is&mdash; the heart:<br />
	For &#39;mid that sunshine, and those smiles,<br />
	When, from our little cares apart,<br />
	And laughing at her girlish wiles,<br />
	I&#39;d throw me on her throbbing breast,<br />
	And pour my spirit out in tears&mdash;<br />
	There was no need to speak the rest&mdash;<br />
	No need to quiet any fears<br />
	Of her&mdash; who ask&#39;d no reason why,<br />
	But turn&#39;d on me her quiet eye!</p>
<p>
	Yet more than worthy of the love<br />
	My spirit struggled with, and strove,<br />
	When, on the mountain peak, alone,<br />
	Ambition lent it a new tone&mdash;<br />
	I had no being&mdash; but in thee:<br />
	The world, and all it did contain<br />
	In the earth&mdash; the air&mdash; the sea&mdash;<br />
	Its joy&mdash; its little lot of pain<br />
	That was new pleasure&mdash; the ideal,<br />
	Dim vanities of dreams by night&mdash;</p>
<p>
	And dimmer nothings which were real&mdash;<br />
	(Shadows&mdash; and a more shadowy light!)<br />
	Parted upon their misty wings,<br />
	And, so, confusedly, became<br />
	Thine image, and&mdash; a name&mdash; a name!<br />
	Two separate&mdash; yet most intimate things.</p>
<p>
	I was ambitious&mdash; have you known<br />
	The passion, father? You have not:<br />
	A cottager, I mark&#39;d a throne<br />
	Of half the world as all my own,<br />
	And murmur&#39;d at such lowly lot&mdash;<br />
	But, just like any other dream,<br />
	Upon the vapour of the dew<br />
	My own had past, did not the beam<br />
	Of beauty which did while it thro&#39;<br />
	The minute&mdash; the hour&mdash; the day&mdash; oppress<br />
	My mind with double loveliness.</p>
<p>
	We walk&#39;d together on the crown<br />
	Of a high mountain which look&#39;d down<br />
	Afar from its proud natural towers<br />
	Of rock and forest, on the hills&mdash;<br />
	The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers,<br />
	And shouting with a thousand rills.</p>
<p>
	I spoke to her of power and pride,<br />
	But mystically&mdash; in such guise<br />
	That she might deem it nought beside<br />
	The moment&#39;s converse; in her eyes<br />
	I read, perhaps too carelessly&mdash;<br />
	A mingled feeling with my own&mdash;<br />
	The flush on her bright cheek, to me<br />
	Seem&#39;d to become a queenly throne<br />
	Too well that I should let it be<br />
	Light in the wilderness alone.</p>
<p>
	I wrapp&#39;d myself in grandeur then,<br />
	And donn&#39;d a visionary crown&mdash;<br />
	Yet it was not that Fantasy<br />
	Had thrown her mantle over me&mdash;<br />
	But that, among the rabble&mdash; men,<br />
	Lion ambition is chained down&mdash;<br />
	And crouches to a keeper&#39;s hand&mdash;<br />
	Not so in deserts where the grand&mdash;<br />
	The wild&mdash; the terrible conspire<br />
	With their own breath to fan his fire.</p>
<p>
	Look &#39;round thee now on Samarcand!<br />
	Is not she queen of Earth? her pride<br />
	Above all cities? in her hand<br />
	Their destinies? in all beside<br />
	Of glory which the world hath known<br />
	Stands she not nobly and alone?<br />
	Falling&mdash; her veriest stepping&mdash;stone<br />
	Shall form the pedestal of a throne&mdash;<br />
	And who her sovereign? Timour&mdash; he<br />
	Whom the astonished people saw<br />
	Striding o&#39;er empires haughtily<br />
	A diadem&#39;d outlaw!</p>
<p>
	O, human love! thou spirit given<br />
	On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!<br />
	Which fall&#39;st into the soul like rain<br />
	Upon the Siroc&mdash;wither&#39;d plain,<br />
	And, failing in thy power to bless,<br />
	But leav&#39;st the heart a wilderness!<br />
	Idea! which bindest life around<br />
	With music of so strange a sound,<br />
	And beauty of so wild a birth&mdash;<br />
	Farewell! for I have won the Earth.</p>
<p>
	When Hope, the eagle that tower&#39;d, could see<br />
	No cliff beyond him in the sky,<br />
	His pinions were bent droopingly&mdash;<br />
	And homeward turn&#39;d his soften&#39;d eye.<br />
	&#39;Twas sunset: when the sun will part<br />
	There comes a sullenness of heart<br />
	To him who still would look upon<br />
	The glory of the summer sun.<br />
	That soul will hate the ev&#39;ning mist,<br />
	So often lovely, and will list<br />
	To the sound of the coming darkness (known<br />
	To those whose spirits hearken) as one<br />
	Who, in a dream of night, would fly<br />
	But cannot from a danger nigh.</p>
<p>
	What tho&#39; the moon&mdash; the white moon<br />
	Shed all the splendour of her noon,<br />
	Her smile is chilly, and her beam,<br />
	In that time of dreariness, will seem<br />
	(So like you gather in your breath)<br />
	A portrait taken after death.<br />
	And boyhood is a summer sun<br />
	Whose waning is the dreariest one&mdash;<br />
	For all we live to know is known,<br />
	And all we seek to keep hath flown&mdash;<br />
	Let life, then, as the day&mdash;flower, fall<br />
	With the noon&mdash;day beauty&mdash; which is all.</p>
<p>
	I reach&#39;d my home&mdash; my home no more<br />
	For all had flown who made it so.<br />
	I pass&#39;d from out its mossy door,<br />
	And, tho&#39; my tread was soft and low,<br />
	A voice came from the threshold stone<br />
	Of one whom I had earlier known&mdash;<br />
	O, I defy thee, Hell, to show<br />
	On beds of fire that burn below,<br />
	A humbler heart&mdash; a deeper woe.</p>
<p>
	Father, I firmly do believe&mdash;<br />
	I know&mdash; for Death, who comes for me<br />
	From regions of the blest afar,<br />
	Where there is nothing to deceive,<br />
	Hath left his iron gate ajar,<br />
	And rays of truth you cannot see<br />
	Are flashing thro&#39; Eternity&mdash;<br />
	I do believe that Eblis hath<br />
	A snare in every human path&mdash;<br />
	Else how, when in the holy grove<br />
	I wandered of the idol, Love,<br />
	Who daily scents his snowy wings<br />
	With incense of burnt offerings<br />
	From the most unpolluted things,<br />
	Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven<br />
	Above with trellis&#39;d rays from Heaven,<br />
	No mote may shun&mdash; no tiniest fly&mdash;<br />
	The lightning of his eagle eye&mdash;<br />
	How was it that Ambition crept,<br />
	Unseen, amid the revels there,<br />
	Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt<br />
	In the tangles of Love&#39;s very hair?</p>
