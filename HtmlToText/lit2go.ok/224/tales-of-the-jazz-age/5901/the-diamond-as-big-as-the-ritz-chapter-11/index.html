	11</p>
<p>
	At sunset John and his two companions reached the huge cliff which had marked the boundaries of the Washington&#39;s dominion, and looking back found the valley tranquil and lovely in the dusk. They sat down to finish the food which Jasmine had brought with her in a basket,</p>
<p>
	&quot;There!&quot; she said, as she spread the table&ndash;cloth and put the sandwiches in a neat pile upon it. &quot;Don&#39;t they look tempting? I always think that food tastes better outdoors.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;With that remark,&quot; remarked Kismine, &quot;Jasmine enters the middle class.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Now,&quot; said John eagerly, &quot;turn out your pocket and let&#39;s see what jewels you brought along. If you made a good selection we three ought to live comfortably all the rest of our lives.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Obediently Kismine put her hand in her pocket and tossed two handfuls of glittering stones before him. &quot;Not so bad,&quot; cried John enthusiastically. &quot;They aren&#39;t very big, but&ndash;Hallo!&quot; His expression changed as he held one of them up to the declining sun. &quot;Why, these aren&#39;t diamonds! There&#39;s something the matter!</p>
<p>
	&quot;By golly!&quot; exclaimed Kismine, with a startled look. &quot;What an idiot I am!&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Why, these are rhinestones!&quot; cried John.</p>
<p>
	&quot;I know.&quot; She broke into a laugh. &quot;I opened the wrong drawer. They belonged on the dress of a girl who visited Jasmine. I got her to give them to me in exchange for diamonds. I&#39;d never seen anything but precious stones before.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;And this is what you brought?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I&#39;m afraid so.&quot; She fingered the brilliants wistfully. &quot;I think I like these better. I&#39;m a little tired of diamonds.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Very well,&quot; said John gloomily. &quot;We&#39;ll have to live in Hades. And you will grow old telling incredulous women that you got the wrong drawer. Unfortunately, your father&#39;s bank&ndash;books were consumed with him.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Well, what&#39;s the matter with Hades?&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;If I come home with a wife at my age my father is just as liable as not to cut me off with a hot coal, as they say down there.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Jasmine spoke up.</p>
<p>
	&quot;I love washing,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;I have always washed my own handkerchiefs. I&#39;ll take in laundry and support you both.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Do they have washwomen in Hades?&quot; asked Kismine innocently.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Of course,&quot; answered John. &quot;It&#39;s just like anywhere else.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;I thought&mdash;perhaps it was too hot to wear any clothes.&quot;</p>
<p>
	John laughed.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Just try it!&quot; he suggested. &quot;They&#39;ll run you out before you&#39;re half started.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Will father be there?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>
	John turned to her in astonishment.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Your father is dead,&quot; he replied sombrely. &quot;Why should he go to Hades? You have it confused with another place that was abolished long ago.&quot;</p>
<p>
	After supper they folded up the table&ndash;cloth and spread their blankets for the night.</p>
<p>
	&quot;What a dream it was,&quot; Kismine sighed, gazing up at the stars. &quot;How strange it seems to be here with one dress and a penniless fianc&eacute;e!</p>
<p>
	&quot;Under the stars,&quot; she repeated. &quot;I never noticed the stars before. I always thought of them as great big diamonds that belonged to some one. Now they frighten me. They make me feel that it was all a dream, all my youth.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;It was a dream,&quot; said John quietly. &quot;Everybody&#39;s youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;How pleasant then to be insane!&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;So I&#39;m told,&quot; said John gloomily. &quot;I don&#39;t know any longer. At any rate, let us love for a while, for a year or so, you and me. That&#39;s a form of divine drunkenness that we can all try. There are only diamonds in the whole world, diamonds and perhaps the shabby gift of disillusion. Well, I have that last and I will make the usual nothing of it.&quot; He shivered. &quot;Turn up your coat collar, little girl, the night&#39;s full of chill and you&#39;ll get pneumonia. His was a great sin who first invented consciousness. Let us lose it for a few hours.&quot;</p>
<p>
	So wrapping himself in his blanket he fell off to sleep.</p>
