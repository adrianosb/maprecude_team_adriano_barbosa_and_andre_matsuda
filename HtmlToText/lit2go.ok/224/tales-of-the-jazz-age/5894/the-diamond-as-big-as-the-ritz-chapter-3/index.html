	3</p>
<p>
	Morning. As he awoke he perceived drowsily that the room had at the same moment become dense with sunlight. The ebony panels of one wall had slid aside on a sort of track, leaving his chamber half open to the day. A large negro in a white uniform stood beside his bed.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Good&ndash;evening,&quot; muttered John, summoning his brains from the wild places.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Good&ndash;morning, sir. Are you ready for your bath, sir? Oh, don&#39;t get up&mdash;I&#39;ll put you in, if you&#39;ll just unbutton your pyjamas&mdash;there. Thank you, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>
	John lay quietly as his pyjamas were removed&mdash;he was amused and delighted; he expected to be lifted like a child by this black Gargantua who was tending him, but nothing of the sort happened; instead he felt the bed tilt up slowly on its side&mdash;he began to roll, startled at first, in the direction of the wall, but when he reached the wall its drapery gave way, and sliding two yards farther down a fleecy incline he plumped gently into water the same temperature as his body.</p>
<p>
	He looked about him. The runway or rollway on which he had arrived had folded gently back into place. He had been projected into another chamber and was sitting in a sunken bath with his head just above the level of the floor. All about him, lining the walls of the room and the sides and bottom of the bath itself, was a blue aquarium, and gazing through the crystal surface on which he sat, he could see fish swimming among amber lights and even gliding without curiosity past his outstretched toes, which were separated from them only by the thickness of the crystal. From overhead, sunlight came down through sea&ndash;green glass.</p>
<p>
	&quot;I suppose, sir, that you&#39;d like hot rosewater and soapsuds this morning, sir&mdash;and perhaps cold salt water to finish.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The negro was standing beside him.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Yes,&quot; agreed John, smiling inanely, &quot;as you please.&quot; Any idea of ordering this bath according to his own meagre standards of living would have been priggish and not a little wicked.</p>
<p>
	The negro pressed a button and a warm rain began to fall, apparently from overhead, but really, so John. discovered after a moment, from a fountain arrangement near by. The water turned to a pale rose colour and jets of liquid soap spurted into it from four miniature walrus heads at the corners of the bath. In a moment a dozen little paddle&ndash;wheels, fixed to the sides, had churned the mixture into a radiant rainbow of pink foam which enveloped him softly with its delicious lightness, and burst in shining, rosy bubbles here and there about him.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Shall I turn on the moving&ndash;picture machine, sir?&quot; suggested the negro deferentially. &quot;There&#39;s a good one&ndash;reel comedy in this machine to&ndash;day, or I can put in a serious piece in a moment, if you prefer it.</p>
<p>
	&quot;No, thanks,&quot; answered John, politely but firmly. He was enjoying his bath too much to desire any distraction. But distraction came. In a moment he was listening intently to the sound of flutes from just outside, flutes dripping a melody that was like a waterfall, cool and green as the room itself, accompanying a frothy piccolo, in play more fragile than the lace of suds that covered and charmed him.</p>
<p>
	After a cold salt&ndash;water bracer and a cold fresh finish, he stepped out and into a fleecy robe, and upon a couch covered with the same material he was rubbed with oil, alcohol, and spice. Later he sat in a voluptuous while he was shaved and his hair was trimmed.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Mr. Percy is waiting in your sitting&ndash;room,&quot; said the negro, when these operations were finished. &quot;My name is Gygsum, Mr. Unger, sir. I am to see to Mr. Unger every morning.&quot;</p>
<p>
	John walked out into the brisk sunshine of his living&ndash;room, where he found breakfast waiting for him and Percy, gorgeous in white kid knickerbockers, smoking in an easy chair.</p>
