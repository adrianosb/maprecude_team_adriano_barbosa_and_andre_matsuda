                <p>
	I was following the Vice-Warden, but, on second thoughts, went after my Lady, being curious to see how she would manage to keep the children out of sight.</p>
<p>
	I found her holding Sylvie&rsquo;s hand, and with her other hand stroking Bruno&rsquo;s hair in a most tender and motherly fashion: both children were looking bewildered and half-frightened.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;My own darlings,&rdquo; she was saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been planning a little treat for you! The Professor shall take you a long walk into the woods this beautiful evening: and you shall take a basket of food with you, and have a little picnic down by the river!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Bruno jumped, and clapped his hands. &ldquo;That are nice!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t it, Sylvie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Sylvie, who hadn&rsquo;t quite lost her surprised look, put up her mouth for a kiss. &ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; she said earnestly.</p>
<p>
	My Lady turned her head away to conceal the broad grin of triumph that spread over her vast face, like a ripple on a lake. &ldquo;Little simpletons!&rdquo; she muttered to herself, as she marched up to the house. I followed her in.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Quite so, your Excellency,&rdquo; the Baron was saying as we entered the Library. &ldquo;All the infantry were under my command.&rdquo; He turned, and was duly presented to my Lady.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A military hero?&rdquo; said my Lady. The fat little man simpered. &ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; he replied, modestly casting down his eyes. &ldquo;My ancestors were all famous for military genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	My Lady smiled graciously. &ldquo;It often runs in families,&rdquo; she remarked: &ldquo;just as a love for pastry does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The Baron looked slightly offended, and the Vice-Warden discreetly changed the subject. &ldquo;Dinner will soon be ready,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;May I have the honor of conducting your Adiposity to the guest-chamber?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Certainly, certainly!&rdquo; the Baron eagerly assented. &ldquo;It would never do to keep dinner waiting!&rdquo; And he almost trotted out of the room after the Vice-Warden.</p>
<p>
	He was back again so speedily that the Vice-warden had barely time to explain to my Lady that her remark about &ldquo;a love for pastry&rdquo; was &ldquo;unfortunate. You might have seen, with half an eye,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that that&rsquo;s his line. Military genius, indeed! Pooh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Dinner ready yet?&rdquo; the Baron enquired, as he hurried into the room.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Will be in a few minutes,&rdquo; the Vice-Warden replied. &ldquo;Meanwhile, let&rsquo;s take a turn in the garden. You were telling me,&rdquo; he continued,</p>
<p>
	as the trio left the house, &ldquo;something about a great battle in which you had the command of the infantry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the Baron. &ldquo;The enemy, as I was saying, far outnumbered us: but I marched my men right into the middle of&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; the Military Hero exclaimed in agitated tones, drawing back behind the Vice-Warden, as a strange creature rushed wildly upon them, brandishing a spade.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the Gardener!&rdquo; the Vice-Warden replied in an encouraging tone. &ldquo;Quite harmless, I assure you. Hark, he&rsquo;s singing! Its his favorite amusement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	And once more those shrill discordant tones rang out:&mdash;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; ">
	&ldquo;He thought he saw a Banker&rsquo;s Clerk<br />
	Descending from the bus:<br />
	He looked again, and found it was<br />
	A Hippopotamus:<br />
	&lsquo;If this should stay to dine,&rsquo; he said,<br />
	&lsquo;There won&rsquo;t be mutch for us!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Throwing away the spade, he broke into a frantic jig, snapping his fingers, and repeating, again and again,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; ">
	&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be much for us!<br />
	There won&rsquo;t be much for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Once more the Baron looked slightly offended, but the Vice-Warden hastily explained that the song had no allusion to him, and in fact had no meaning at all. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mean anything by it, now did you?&rdquo; He appealed to the Gardener, who had finished his song, and stood, balancing himself on one leg, and looking at them, with his mouth open.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I never means nothing,&rdquo; said the Gardener: and Uggug luckily came up at the moment, and gave the conversation a new turn.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Allow me to present my son,&rdquo; said the Vice-warden; adding, in a whisper, &ldquo;one of the best and cleverest boys that ever lived! I&rsquo;ll contrive for you to see some of his cleverness. He knows everything that other boys don&rsquo;t know; and in archery, in fishing, in painting, and in music, his skill is&mdash;but you shall judge for yourself. You see that target over there? He shall shoot an arrow at it. Dear boy,&rdquo;he went on aloud, &ldquo;his Adiposity would like to see you shoot. Bring his Highness&rsquo; bow and arrows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Uggug looked very sulky as he received the bow and arrow, and prepared to shoot. Just as the arrow left the bow, the Vice-Warden trod heavily on the toe of the Baron, who yelled with the pain.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Ten thousand pardons!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I stepped back in my excitement. See! It is a bull&rsquo;s-eye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The Baron gazed in astonishment. &ldquo;He held the bow so awkwardly, it seemed impossible!&rdquo; he muttered. But there was no room for doubt: there was the arrow, right in the centre of the bull&rsquo;s-eye!</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The lake is close by,&rdquo; continued the Vice-warden. &ldquo;Bring his Highness&rsquo; fishing-rod!&rdquo; And Uggug most unwillingly held the rod, and dangled the fly over the water.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A beetle on your arm!&rdquo; cried my Lady, pinching the poor Baron&rsquo;s arm worse than if ten lobsters had seized it at once. &ldquo;That kind is poisonous,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;But what a pity! You missed seeing the fish pulled out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	An enormous dead cod-fish was lying on the bank, with the hook in its mouth.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I had always fancied,&rdquo; the Baron faltered, &ldquo;that cod were salt-water fish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Not in this country,&rdquo; said the Vice-Warden. &ldquo;Shall we go in? Ask my son some question on the way any subject you like!&rdquo; And the sulky boy was violently shoved forwards, to walk at the Baron&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Could your Highness tell me,&rdquo; the Baron cautiously began, &ldquo;how much seven times nine would come to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Turn to the left!&rdquo; cried the Vice-Warden, hastily stepping forwards to show the way&mdash;so hastily, that he ran against his unfortunate guest, who fell heavily on his face.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So sorry!&rdquo; my Lady exclaimed, as she and her husband helped him to his feet again. &ldquo;My son was in the act of saying &lsquo;sixty-three&rsquo; as you fell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The Baron said nothing: he was covered with dust, and seemed much hurt, both in body and mind. However, when they had got him into the house, and given him a good brushing, matters looked a little better.</p>
<p>
	Dinner was served in due course, and every fresh dish seemed to increase the good-humour of the Baron: but all efforts, to get him to express his opinion as to Uggug&rsquo;s cleverness, were in vain, until that interesting youth had left the room, and was seen from the open window, prowling about the lawn with a little basket, which he was filling with frogs.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So fond of Natural History as he is, dear boy!&rdquo; said the doting mother. &ldquo;Now do tell us, Baron, what you think of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;To be perfectly candid, said the cautious Baron, &ldquo;I would like a little more evidence. I think you mentioned his skill in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Music?&rdquo; said the Vice-Warden. &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s simply a prodigy! You shall hear him play the piano? And he walked to the window. &ldquo;Ug&mdash;I mean my boy! Come in for a minute, and bring the music-master with you! To turn over the music for him,&rdquo; he added as an explanation.</p>
<p>
	Uggug, having filled his basket with frogs, had no objection to obey, and soon appeared in the room, followed by a fierce-looking little man, who asked the Vice-Warden &ldquo;Vot music vill you haf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The Sonata that His Highness plays so charmingly,&rdquo; said the Vice-Warden. &ldquo;His Highness haf not&mdash;&rdquo; the music-master began, but was sharply stopped by the Vice-warden.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Silence, Sir! Go and turn over the music for his Highness. My dear,&rdquo; (to the Wardeness) &ldquo;will you show him what to do? And meanwhile, Baron, I&rsquo;ll just show you a most interesting map we have&mdash;of Outland, and Fairyland, and that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	By the time my Lady had returned, from explaining things to the music-master, the map had been hung up, and the Baron was already much bewildered by the Vice-Warden&rsquo;s habit of pointing to one place while he shouted out the name of another.</p>
<p>
	My Lady joining in, pointing out other places, and shouting other names, only made matters worse; and at last the Baron, in despair, took to pointing out places for himself, and feebly asked &ldquo;Is that great yellow splotch Fairyland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s Fairyland,&rdquo; said the Vice-warden: &ldquo;and you might as well give him a hint,&rdquo; he muttered to my Lady, &ldquo;about going back to-morrow. He eats like a shark! It would hardly do for me to mention it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	His wife caught the idea, and at once began giving hints of the most subtle and delicate kind. &ldquo;Just see what a short way it is back to Fairyland! Why, if you started to-morrow morning, you&rsquo;d get there in very little more than a week!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The Baron looked incredulous. &ldquo;It took me a full month to come,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s ever so much shorter, going back, you know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	The Baron looked appealingly to the Vice-warden, who chimed in readily. &ldquo;You can go back five times, in the time it took you to come here once&mdash;if you start to-morrow morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	All this time the Sonata was pealing through the room. The Baron could not help admitting to himself that it was being magnificently played: but he tried in vain to get a glimpse of the youthful performer. Every time he had nearly succeeded in catching sight of him, either the Vice-Warden or his wife was sure to get in the way, pointing out some new place on the map, and deafening him with some new name.</p>
<p>
	He gave in at last, wished a hasty good-night, and left the room, while his host and hostess interchanged looks of triumph.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Deftly done!&rdquo; cried the Vice-Warden. &ldquo;Craftily contrived! But what means all that tramping on the stairs?&rdquo; He half-opened the door, looked out, and added in a tone of dismay, &ldquo;The Baron&rsquo;s boxes are being carried down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And what means all that rumbling of wheels?&rdquo; cried my Lady. She peeped through the window curtains. &ldquo;The Baron&rsquo;s carriage has come round!&rdquo; she groaned.</p>
<p>
	At this moment the door opened: a fat, furious face looked in: a voice, hoarse with passion, thundered out the words &ldquo;My room is full of frogs&mdash;I leave you!&rdquo;: and the door closed again.</p>
<p>
	And still the noble Sonata went pealing through the room: but it was Arthur&rsquo;s masterly touch that roused the echoes, and thrilled my very soul with the tender music of the immortal &lsquo;Sonata Pathetique&rsquo;: and it was not till the last note had died away that the tired but happy traveler could bring himself to utter the words &ldquo;good-night!&rdquo; and to seek his much-needed pillow.</p>
