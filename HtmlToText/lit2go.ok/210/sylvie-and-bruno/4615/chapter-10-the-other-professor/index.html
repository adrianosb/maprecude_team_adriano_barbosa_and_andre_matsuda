                <p>
	&ldquo;We were looking for you!&rdquo; cried Sylvie, in a tone of great relief. &ldquo;We do want you so much, you ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What is it, dear children?&rdquo; the Professor asked, beaming on them with a very different look from what Uggug ever got from him.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We want you to speak to the Gardener for us,&rdquo; Sylvie said, as she and Bruno took the old man&rsquo;s hands and led him into the hall.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He&rsquo;s ever so unkind!&rdquo; Bruno mournfully added. &ldquo;They&rsquo;s all unkind to us, now that Father&rsquo;s gone. The Lion were much nicer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But you must explain to me, please,&rdquo; the Professor said with an anxious look, &ldquo;which is the Lion, and which is the Gardener. It&rsquo;s most important not to get two such animals confused together. And one&rsquo;s very liable to do it in their case&mdash;both having mouths, you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Doos oo always confuses two animals together?&rdquo; Bruno asked.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Pretty often, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; the Professor candidly confessed. &ldquo;Now, for instance, there&rsquo;s the rabbit-hutch and the hall-clock.&rdquo; The Professor pointed them out. &ldquo;One gets a little confused with them&mdash;both having doors, you know. Now, only yesterday&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;I put some lettuces into the clock, and tried to wind up the rabbit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Did the rabbit go, after oo wounded it up?&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>
	The Professor clasped his hands on the top of his head, and groaned. &ldquo;Go? I should think it did go! Why, it&rsquo;s gone? And where ever it&rsquo;s gone to&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t find out! I&rsquo;ve done my best&mdash;I&rsquo;ve read all the article &lsquo;Rabbit&rsquo; in the great dictionary&mdash;Come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Only the tailor, Sir, with your little bill,&rdquo; said a meek voice outside the door.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Ah, well, I can soon settle his business,&rdquo; the Professor said to the children, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll just wait a minute. How much is it, this year, my man?&rdquo; The tailor had come in while he was speaking.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s been a doubling so many years, you see,&rdquo; the tailor replied, a little gruffly, &ldquo;and I think I&rsquo;d like the money now. It&rsquo;s two thousand pound, it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo; the Professor carelessly remarked, feeling in his pocket, as if he always carried at least that amount about with him. &ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t you like to wait just another year, and make it four thousand? Just think how rich you&rsquo;d be! Why, you might be a King, if you liked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I&rsquo;d care about being a King,&rdquo; the man said thoughtfully. &ldquo;But it; dew sound a powerful sight o&rsquo; money! Well, I think I&rsquo;ll wait&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Of course you will!&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s good sense in you, I see. Good-day to you, my man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Will you ever have to pay him that four thousand pounds?&rdquo; Sylvie asked as the door closed on the departing creditor.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Never, my child!&rdquo; the Professor replied emphatically. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll go on doubling it, till he dies. You see it&rsquo;s always worth while waiting another year, to get twice as much money! And now what would you like to do, my little friends? Shall I take you to see the Other Professor? This would be an excellent opportunity for a visit,&rdquo; he said to himself, glancing at his watch: &ldquo;he generally takes a short rest &mdash;of fourteen minutes and a half&mdash;about this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Bruno hastily went round to Sylvie, who was standing at the other side of the Professor, and put his hand into hers. &ldquo;I thinks we&rsquo;d like to go,&rdquo; he said doubtfully: &ldquo;only please let&rsquo;s go all together. It&rsquo;s best to be on the safe side, oo know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Why, you talk as if you were Sylvie!&rdquo; exclaimed the Professor.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I know I did,&rdquo; Bruno replied very humbly. &ldquo;I quite forgotted I wasn&rsquo;t Sylvie. Only I fought he might be rarver fierce!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The Professor laughed a jolly laugh. &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s quite tame!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He never bites. He&rsquo;s only a little&mdash;a little dreamy, you know.&rdquo; He took hold of Bruno&rsquo;s other hand; and led the children down a long passage I had never noticed before&mdash;not that there was anything remarkable in that: I was constantly coming on new rooms and passages in that mysterious Palace, and very seldom succeeded in finding the old ones again.</p>
<p>
	Near the end of the passage the Professor stopped. &ldquo;This is his room,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the solid wall.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t get in through there!&rdquo; Bruno exclaimed.</p>
<p>
	Sylvie said nothing, till she had carefully examined whether the wall opened anywhere. Then she laughed merrily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re playing us a trick, you dear old thing!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no door here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any door to the room,&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;We shall have to climb in at the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	So we went into the garden, and soon found the window of the Other Professor&rsquo;s room. It was a ground-floor window, and stood invitingly open: the Professor first lifted the two children in, and then he and I climbed in after them.</p>
<p>
	The Other Professor was seated at a table, with a large book open before him, on which his forehead was resting: he had clasped his arms round the book, and was snoring heavily. &ldquo;He usually reads like that,&rdquo; the Professor remarked, &ldquo;when the book&rsquo;s very interesting: and then sometimes it&rsquo;s very difficult to get him to attend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	This seemed to be one of the difficult times: the Professor lifted him up, once or twice, and shook him violently: but he always returned to his book the moment he was let go of, and showed by his heavy breathing that the book was as interesting as ever.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;How dreamy he is!&rdquo; the Professor exclaimed. &ldquo;He must have got to a very interesting part of the book!&rdquo; And he rained quite a shower of thumps on the Other Professor&rsquo;s back, shouting &ldquo;Hoy! Hoy!&rdquo; all the time. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful that he should be so dreamy?&rdquo; he said to Bruno.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s always as sleepy as that,&rdquo; Bruno remarked, &ldquo;a course he&rsquo;s dreamy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;But what are we to do?&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;You see he&rsquo;s quite wrapped up in the book!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Suppose oo shuts the book?&rdquo; Bruno suggested.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried the delighted Professor. &ldquo;Of course that&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; And he shut up the book so quickly that he caught the Other Professor&rsquo;s nose between the leaves, and gave it a severe pinch.</p>
<p>
	The Other Professor instantly rose to his feet, and carried the book away to the end of the room, where he put it back in its place in the book-case. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been reading for eighteen hours and three-quarters,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and now I shall rest for fourteen minutes and a half. Is the Lecture all ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Very nearly, &ldquo;the Professor humbly replied. &ldquo;I shall ask you to give me a hint or two&mdash;there will be a few little difficulties&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And Banquet, I think you said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oh, yes! The Banquet comes first, of course. People never enjoy Abstract Science, you know, when they&rsquo;re ravenous with hunger. And then there&rsquo;s the Fancy-Dress-Ball. Oh, there&rsquo;ll be lots of entertainment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Where will the Ball come in?&rdquo; said the Other Professor.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I think it had better come at the beginning of the Banquet&mdash;it brings people together so nicely, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the right order. First the Meeting: then the Eating: then the Treating&mdash;for I&rsquo;m sure any Lecture you give us will be a treat!&rdquo; said the Other Professor, who had been standing with his back to us all this time, occupying himself in taking the books out, one by one, and turning them upside-down. An easel, with a black board on it, stood near him: and, every time that he turned a book upside-down, he made a mark on the board with a piece of chalk.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And as to the &lsquo;Pig-Tale&rsquo;&mdash;which you have so kindly promised to give us&mdash;&rdquo; the Professor went on, thoughtfully rubbing his chin. &ldquo;I think that had better come at the end of the Banquet: then people can listen to it quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Shall I sing it?&rdquo; the Other Professor asked, with a smile of delight.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;If you can,&rdquo; the Professor replied, cautiously.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Let me try,&rdquo; said the Other Professor, seating himself at the pianoforte. &ldquo;For the sake of argument, let us assume that it begins on A flat.&rdquo; And he struck the note in question. &ldquo;La, la, la! I think that&rsquo;s within an octave of it.&rdquo; He struck the note again, and appealed to Bruno, who was standing at his side. &ldquo;Did I sing it like that, my child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No, oo didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Bruno replied with great decision. &ldquo;It were more like a duck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Single notes are apt to have that effect,&rdquo; the Other Professor said with a sigh. &ldquo;Let me try a whole verse.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; ">
	There was a Pig, that sat alone,<br />
	Beside a ruined Pump.<br />
	By day and night he made his moan:<br />
	It would have stirred a heart of stone<br />
	To see him wring his hoofs and groan,<br />
	Because he could not jump.</p>
<p>
	Would you call that a tune, Professor?&rdquo; he asked, when he had finished.</p>
<p>
	The Professor considered a little. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;some of the notes are the same as others and some are different but I should hardly call it a tune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Let me try it a bit by myself,&rdquo; said the Other Professor. And he began touching the notes here and there, and humming to himself like an angry bluebottle.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;How do you like his singing?&rdquo; the Professor asked the children in a low voice.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t very beautiful,&rdquo; Sylvie said, hesitatingly.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very extremely ugly!&rdquo; Bruno said, without any hesitation at all.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;All extremes are bad,&rdquo; the Professor said, very gravely. &ldquo;For instance, Sobriety is a very good thing, when practised in moderation: but even Sobriety, when carried to an extreme, has its disadvantages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What are its disadvantages?&rdquo; was the question that rose in my mind&mdash; and, as usual, Bruno asked it for me. &ldquo;What are its lizard bandages?&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Well, this is one of them,&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;When a man&rsquo;s tipsy (that&rsquo;s one extreme, you know), he sees one thing as two. But, when he&rsquo;s extremely sober (that&rsquo;s the other extreme), he sees two things as one. It&rsquo;s equally inconvenient, whichever happens.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What does &lsquo;illconvenient&rsquo; mean?&rdquo; Bruno whispered to Sylvie.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The difference between &lsquo;convenient&rsquo; and &lsquo;inconvenient&rsquo; is best explained by an example,&rdquo; said the Other Professor, who had overheard the question. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll just think over any Poem that contains the two words&mdash;such as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The Professor put his hands over his ears, with a look of dismay. &ldquo;If you once let him begin a Poem,&rdquo; he said to Sylvie, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll never leave off again! He never does!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Did he ever begin a Poem and not leave off again?&rdquo; Sylvie enquired.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Three times,&rdquo; said the Professor.</p>
<p>
	Bruno raised himself on tiptoe, till his lips were on a level with Sylvie&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;What became of them three Poems?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Is he saying them all, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;The Other Professor is speaking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it very quick,&rdquo; murmured the Other Professor, with downcast eyes, and melancholy voice, which contrasted oddly with his face, as he had forgotten to leave off smiling. (&ldquo;At least it wasn&rsquo;t exactly a smile,&rdquo; as Sylvie said afterwards: &ldquo;it looked as if his mouth was made that shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Go on then,&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;What must be must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Remember that!&rdquo; Sylvie whispered to Bruno, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very good rule for whenever you hurt yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a very good rule for whenever I make a noise,&rdquo; said the saucy little fellow. &ldquo;So you remember it too, Miss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Whatever do you mean?&rdquo; said Sylvie, trying to frown, a thing she never managed particularly well.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Oftens and oftens,&rdquo; said Bruno, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t oo told me &lsquo; There mustn&rsquo;t be so much noise, Bruno!&rsquo; when I&rsquo;ve tolded oo &lsquo;There must!&rsquo; Why, there isn&rsquo;t no rules at all about &lsquo;There mustn&rsquo;t&rsquo;! But oo never believes me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;As if any one could believe you, you wicked wicked boy!&rdquo; said Sylvie. The words were severe enough, but I am of opinion that, when you are really anxious to impress a criminal with a sense of his guilt, you ought not to pronounce the sentence with your lips quite close to his cheek&mdash;since a kiss at the end of it, however accidental, weakens the effect terribly.</p>
