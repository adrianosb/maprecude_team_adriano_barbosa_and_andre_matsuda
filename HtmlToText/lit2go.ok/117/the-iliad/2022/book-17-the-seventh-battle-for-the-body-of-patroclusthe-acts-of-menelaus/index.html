                <p>
	Menelaus, upon the death of Patroclus, defends his body from the enemy: Euphorbus, who attempts it, is slain. Hector advancing, Menelaus retires; but soon returns with Ajax, and drives him off. This, Glaucus objects to Hector as a flight, who thereupon puts on the armour he had won from Patroclus, and renews the battle. The Greeks give way, till Ajax rallies them: &AElig;neas sustains the Trojans. &AElig;neas and Hector Attempt the chariot of Achilles, which is borne off by Automedon. The horses of Achilles deplore the loss of Patroclus: Jupiter covers his body with a thick darkness: the noble prayer of Ajax on that occasion. Menelaus sends Antilochus to Achilles, with the news of Patroclus&#39; death: then returns to the fight, where, though attacked with the utmost fury, he and Meriones, assisted by the Ajaces, bear off the body to the ships.</p>
<p>
	The time is the evening of the eight&ndash;and&ndash;twentieth day. The scene lies in the fields before Troy.</p>
<p>
	On the cold earth divine Patroclus spread,<br />
	Lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead.<br />
	Great Menelaus, touch&#39;d with generous woe,<br />
	Springs to the front, and guards him from the foe.<br />
	Thus round her new&ndash;fallen young the heifer moves,<br />
	Fruit of her throes, and first&ndash;born of her loves;<br />
	And anxious (helpless as he lies, and bare)<br />
	Turns, and re&ndash;turns her, with a mother&#39;s care,<br />
	Opposed to each that near the carcase came,<br />
	His broad shield glimmers, and his lances flame.</p>
<p>
	The son of Panthus, skill&#39;d the dart to send,<br />
	Eyes the dead hero, and insults the friend.<br />
	&quot;This hand, Atrides, laid Patroclus low;<br />
	Warrior! desist, nor tempt an equal blow:<br />
	To me the spoils my prowess won, resign:<br />
	Depart with life, and leave the glory mine&quot;</p>
<p>
	The Trojan thus: the Spartan monarch burn&#39;d<br />
	With generous anguish, and in scorn return&#39;d:<br />
	&quot;Laugh&#39;st thou not, Jove! from thy superior throne,<br />
	When mortals boast of prowess not their own?<br />
	Not thus the lion glories in his might,<br />
	Nor panther braves his spotted foe in fight,<br />
	Nor thus the boar (those terrors of the plain;)<br />
	Man only vaunts his force, and vaunts in vain.<br />
	But far the vainest of the boastful kind,<br />
	These sons of Panthus vent their haughty mind.<br />
	Yet &#39;twas but late, beneath my conquering steel<br />
	This boaster&#39;s brother, Hyperenor, fell;<br />
	Against our arm which rashly he defied,<br />
	Vain was his vigour, and as vain his pride.<br />
	These eyes beheld him on the dust expire,<br />
	No more to cheer his spouse, or glad his sire.<br />
	Presumptuous youth! like his shall be thy doom,<br />
	Go, wait thy brother to the Stygian gloom;<br />
	Or, while thou may&#39;st, avoid the threaten&#39;d fate;<br />
	Fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Unmoved, Euphorbus thus: &quot;That action known,<br />
	Come, for my brother&#39;s blood repay thy own.<br />
	His weeping father claims thy destined head,<br />
	And spouse, a widow in her bridal bed.<br />
	On these thy conquer&#39;d spoils I shall bestow,<br />
	To soothe a consort&#39;s and a parent&#39;s woe.<br />
	No longer then defer the glorious strife,<br />
	Let heaven decide our fortune, fame, and life.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Swift as the word the missile lance he flings;<br />
	The well&ndash;aim&#39;d weapon on the buckler rings,<br />
	But blunted by the brass, innoxious falls.<br />
	On Jove the father great Atrides calls,<br />
	Nor flies the javelin from his arm in vain,<br />
	It pierced his throat, and bent him to the plain;<br />
	Wide through the neck appears the grisly wound,<br />
	Prone sinks the warrior, and his arms resound.<br />
	The shining circlets of his golden hair,<br />
	Which even the Graces might be proud to wear,<br />
	Instarr&#39;d with gems and gold, bestrow the shore,<br />
	With dust dishonour&#39;d, and deform&#39;d with gore.</p>
<p>
	As the young olive, in some sylvan scene,<br />
	Crown&#39;d by fresh fountains with eternal green,<br />
	Lifts the gay head, in snowy flowerets fair,<br />
	And plays and dances to the gentle air;<br />
	When lo! a whirlwind from high heaven invades<br />
	The tender plant, and withers all its shades;<br />
	It lies uprooted from its genial bed,<br />
	A lovely ruin now defaced and dead:<br />
	Thus young, thus beautiful, Euphorbus lay,<br />
	While the fierce Spartan tore his arms away.<br />
	Proud of his deed, and glorious in the prize,<br />
	Affrighted Troy the towering victor flies:<br />
	Flies, as before some mountain lion&#39;s ire<br />
	The village curs and trembling swains retire,<br />
	When o&#39;er the slaughter&#39;d bull they hear him roar,<br />
	And see his jaws distil with smoking gore:<br />
	All pale with fear, at distance scatter&#39;d round,<br />
	They shout incessant, and the vales resound.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile Apollo view&#39;d with envious eyes,<br />
	And urged great Hector to dispute the prize;<br />
	(In Mentes&#39; shape, beneath whose martial care<br />
	The rough Ciconians learn&#39;d the trade of war;)<br />
	&quot;Forbear (he cried) with fruitless speed to chase<br />
	Achilles&#39; coursers, of ethereal race;<br />
	They stoop not, these, to mortal man&#39;s command,<br />
	Or stoop to none but great Achilles&#39; hand.<br />
	Too long amused with a pursuit so vain,<br />
	Turn, and behold the brave Euphorbus slain;<br />
	By Sparta slain! for ever now suppress&#39;d<br />
	The fire which burn&#39;d in that undaunted breast!&quot;</p>
<p>
	Thus having spoke, Apollo wing&#39;d his flight,<br />
	And mix&#39;d with mortals in the toils of fight:<br />
	His words infix&#39;d unutterable care<br />
	Deep in great Hector&#39;s soul: through all the war<br />
	He darts his anxious eye; and, instant, view&#39;d<br />
	The breathless hero in his blood imbued,<br />
	(Forth welling from the wound, as prone he lay)<br />
	And in the victor&#39;s hands the shining prey.<br />
	Sheath&#39;d in bright arms, through cleaving ranks he flies,<br />
	And sends his voice in thunder to the skies:<br />
	Fierce as a flood of flame by Vulcan sent,<br />
	It flew, and fired the nations as it went.<br />
	Atrides from the voice the storm divined,<br />
	And thus explored his own unconquer&#39;d mind:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Then shall I quit Patroclus on the plain,<br />
	Slain in my cause, and for my honour slain!<br />
	Desert the arms, the relics, of my friend?<br />
	Or singly, Hector and his troops attend?<br />
	Sure where such partial favour heaven bestow&#39;d,<br />
	To brave the hero were to brave the god:<br />
	Forgive me, Greece, if once I quit the field;<br />
	&#39;Tis not to Hector, but to heaven I yield.<br />
	Yet, nor the god, nor heaven, should give me fear,<br />
	Did but the voice of Ajax reach my ear:<br />
	Still would we turn, still battle on the plains,<br />
	And give Achilles all that yet remains<br />
	Of his and our Patroclus&mdash;&quot; This, no more<br />
	The time allow&#39;d: Troy thicken&#39;d on the shore.<br />
	A sable scene! The terrors Hector led.<br />
	Slow he recedes, and sighing quits the dead.</p>
<p>
	So from the fold the unwilling lion parts,<br />
	Forced by loud clamours, and a storm of darts;<br />
	He flies indeed, but threatens as he flies,<br />
	With heart indignant and retorted eyes.<br />
	Now enter&#39;d in the Spartan ranks, he turn&#39;d<br />
	His manly breast, and with new fury burn&#39;d;<br />
	O&#39;er all the black battalions sent his view,<br />
	And through the cloud the godlike Ajax knew;<br />
	Where labouring on the left the warrior stood,<br />
	All grim in arms, and cover&#39;d o&#39;er with blood;<br />
	There breathing courage, where the god of day<br />
	Had sunk each heart with terror and dismay.</p>
<p>
	To him the king: &quot;Oh Ajax, oh my friend!<br />
	Haste, and Patroclus&#39; loved remains defend:<br />
	The body to Achilles to restore<br />
	Demands our care; alas, we can no more!<br />
	For naked now, despoiled of arms, he lies;<br />
	And Hector glories in the dazzling prize.&quot;<br />
	He said, and touch&#39;d his heart. The raging pair<br />
	Pierced the thick battle, and provoke the war.<br />
	Already had stern Hector seized his head,<br />
	And doom&#39;d to Trojan gods the unhappy dead;<br />
	But soon as Ajax rear&#39;d his tower&ndash;like shield,<br />
	Sprung to his car, and measured back the field,<br />
	His train to Troy the radiant armour bear,<br />
	To stand a trophy of his fame in war.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile great Ajax (his broad shield display&#39;d)<br />
	Guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade;<br />
	And now before, and now behind he stood:<br />
	Thus in the centre of some gloomy wood,<br />
	With many a step, the lioness surrounds<br />
	Her tawny young, beset by men and hounds;<br />
	Elate her heart, and rousing all her powers,<br />
	Dark o&#39;er the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours.<br />
	Fast by his side the generous Spartan glows<br />
	With great revenge, and feeds his inward woes.</p>
<p>
	But Glaucus, leader of the Lycian aids,<br />
	On Hector frowning, thus his flight upbraids:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Where now in Hector shall we Hector find?<br />
	A manly form, without a manly mind.<br />
	Is this, O chief! a hero&#39;s boasted fame?<br />
	How vain, without the merit, is the name!<br />
	Since battle is renounced, thy thoughts employ<br />
	What other methods may preserve thy Troy:<br />
	&#39;Tis time to try if Ilion&#39;s state can stand<br />
	By thee alone, nor ask a foreign hand:<br />
	Mean, empty boast! but shall the Lycians stake<br />
	Their lives for you? those Lycians you forsake?<br />
	What from thy thankless arms can we expect?<br />
	Thy friend Sarpedon proves thy base neglect;<br />
	Say, shall our slaughter&#39;d bodies guard your walls,<br />
	While unreveng&#39;d the great Sarpedon falls?<br />
	Even where he died for Troy, you left him there,<br />
	A feast for dogs, and all the fowls of air.<br />
	On my command if any Lycian wait,<br />
	Hence let him march, and give up Troy to fate.<br />
	Did such a spirit as the gods impart<br />
	Impel one Trojan hand or Trojan heart,<br />
	(Such as should burn in every soul that draws<br />
	The sword for glory, and his country&#39;s cause)<br />
	Even yet our mutual arms we might employ,<br />
	And drag yon carcase to the walls of Troy.<br />
	Oh! were Patroclus ours, we might obtain<br />
	Sarpedon&#39;s arms and honour&#39;d corse again!<br />
	Greece with Achilles&#39; friend should be repaid,<br />
	And thus due honours purchased to his shade.<br />
	But words are vain&mdash;Let Ajax once appear,<br />
	And Hector trembles and recedes with fear;<br />
	Thou dar&#39;st not meet the terrors of his eye;<br />
	And lo! already thou prepar&#39;st to fly.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The Trojan chief with fix&#39;d resentment eyed<br />
	The Lycian leader, and sedate replied:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Say, is it just, my friend, that Hector&#39;s ear<br />
	From such a warrior such a speech should hear?<br />
	I deem&#39;d thee once the wisest of thy kind,<br />
	But ill this insult suits a prudent mind.<br />
	I shun great Ajax? I desert my train?<br />
	&#39;Tis mine to prove the rash assertion vain;<br />
	I joy to mingle where the battle bleeds,<br />
	And hear the thunder of the sounding steeds.<br />
	But Jove&#39;s high will is ever uncontroll&#39;d,<br />
	The strong he withers, and confounds the bold;<br />
	Now crowns with fame the mighty man, and now<br />
	Strikes the fresh garland from the victor&#39;s brow!<br />
	Come, through yon squadrons let us hew the way,<br />
	And thou be witness, if I fear to&ndash;day;<br />
	If yet a Greek the sight of Hector dread,<br />
	Or yet their hero dare defend the dead.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Then turning to the martial hosts, he cries:<br />
	&quot;Ye Trojans, Dardans, Lycians, and allies!<br />
	Be men, my friends, in action as in name,<br />
	And yet be mindful of your ancient fame.<br />
	Hector in proud Achilles&#39; arms shall shine,<br />
	Torn from his friend, by right of conquest mine.&quot;</p>
<p>
	He strode along the field, as thus he said:<br />
	(The sable plumage nodded o&#39;er his head:)<br />
	Swift through the spacious plain he sent a look;<br />
	One instant saw, one instant overtook<br />
	The distant band, that on the sandy shore<br />
	The radiant spoils to sacred Ilion bore.<br />
	There his own mail unbraced the field bestrow&#39;d;<br />
	His train to Troy convey&#39;d the massy load.<br />
	Now blazing in the immortal arms he stands;<br />
	The work and present of celestial hands;<br />
	By aged Peleus to Achilles given,<br />
	As first to Peleus by the court of heaven:<br />
	His father&#39;s arms not long Achilles wears,<br />
	Forbid by fate to reach his father&#39;s years.</p>
<p>
	Him, proud in triumph, glittering from afar,<br />
	The god whose thunder rends the troubled air<br />
	Beheld with pity; as apart he sat,<br />
	And, conscious, look&#39;d through all the scene of fate.<br />
	He shook the sacred honours of his head;<br />
	Olympus trembled, and the godhead said;<br />
	&quot;Ah, wretched man! unmindful of thy end!<br />
	A moment&#39;s glory; and what fates attend!<br />
	In heavenly panoply divinely bright<br />
	Thou stand&#39;st, and armies tremble at thy sight,<br />
	As at Achilles&#39; self! beneath thy dart<br />
	Lies slain the great Achilles&#39; dearer part.<br />
	Thou from the mighty dead those arms hast torn,<br />
	Which once the greatest of mankind had worn.<br />
	Yet live! I give thee one illustrious day,<br />
	A blaze of glory ere thou fad&#39;st away.<br />
	For ah! no more Andromache shall come<br />
	With joyful tears to welcome Hector home;<br />
	No more officious, with endearing charms,<br />
	From thy tired limbs unbrace Pelides&#39; arms!&quot;</p>
<p>
	Then with his sable brow he gave the nod<br />
	That seals his word; the sanction of the god.<br />
	The stubborn arms (by Jove&#39;s command disposed)<br />
	Conform&#39;d spontaneous, and around him closed:<br />
	Fill&#39;d with the god, enlarged his members grew,<br />
	Through all his veins a sudden vigour flew,<br />
	The blood in brisker tides began to roll,<br />
	And Mars himself came rushing on his soul.<br />
	Exhorting loud through all the field he strode,<br />
	And look&#39;d, and moved, Achilles, or a god.<br />
	Now Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, he inspires,<br />
	Now Phorcys, Chromius, and Hippothous fires;<br />
	The great Thersilochus like fury found,<br />
	Asteropaeus kindled at the sound,<br />
	And Ennomus, in augury renown&#39;d.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Hear, all ye hosts, and hear, unnumber&#39;d bands<br />
	Of neighbouring nations, or of distant lands!<br />
	&#39;Twas not for state we summon&#39;d you so far,<br />
	To boast our numbers, and the pomp of war:<br />
	Ye came to fight; a valiant foe to chase,<br />
	To save our present, and our future race.<br />
	Tor this, our wealth, our products, you enjoy,<br />
	And glean the relics of exhausted Troy.<br />
	Now then, to conquer or to die prepare;<br />
	To die or conquer are the terms of war.<br />
	Whatever hand shall win Patroclus slain,<br />
	Whoe&#39;er shall drag him to the Trojan train,<br />
	With Hector&#39;s self shall equal honours claim;<br />
	With Hector part the spoil, and share the fame.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Fired by his words, the troops dismiss their fears,<br />
	They join, they thicken, they protend their spears;<br />
	Full on the Greeks they drive in firm array,<br />
	And each from Ajax hopes the glorious prey:<br />
	Vain hope! what numbers shall the field o&#39;erspread,<br />
	What victims perish round the mighty dead!</p>
<p>
	Great Ajax mark&#39;d the growing storm from far,<br />
	And thus bespoke his brother of the war:<br />
	&quot;Our fatal day, alas! is come, my friend;<br />
	And all our wars and glories at an end!<br />
	&#39;Tis not this corse alone we guard in vain,<br />
	Condemn&#39;d to vultures on the Trojan plain;<br />
	We too must yield: the same sad fate must fall<br />
	On thee, on me, perhaps, my friend, on all.<br />
	See what a tempest direful Hector spreads,<br />
	And lo! it bursts, it thunders on our heads!<br />
	Call on our Greeks, if any hear the call,<br />
	The bravest Greeks: this hour demands them all.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The warrior raised his voice, and wide around<br />
	The field re&ndash;echoed the distressful sound.<br />
	&quot;O chiefs! O princes, to whose hand is given<br />
	The rule of men; whose glory is from heaven!<br />
	Whom with due honours both Atrides grace:<br />
	Ye guides and guardians of our Argive race!<br />
	All, whom this well&ndash;known voice shall reach from far,<br />
	All, whom I see not through this cloud of war;<br />
	Come all! let generous rage your arms employ,<br />
	And save Patroclus from the dogs of Troy.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Oilean Ajax first the voice obey&#39;d,<br />
	Swift was his pace, and ready was his aid:<br />
	Next him Idomeneus, more slow with age,<br />
	And Merion, burning with a hero&#39;s rage.<br />
	The long&ndash;succeeding numbers who can name?<br />
	But all were Greeks, and eager all for fame.<br />
	Fierce to the charge great Hector led the throng;<br />
	Whole Troy embodied rush&#39;d with shouts along.<br />
	Thus, when a mountain billow foams and raves,<br />
	Where some swoln river disembogues his waves,<br />
	Full in the mouth is stopp&#39;d the rushing tide,<br />
	The boiling ocean works from side to side,<br />
	The river trembles to his utmost shore,<br />
	And distant rocks re&ndash;bellow to the roar.</p>
<p>
	Nor less resolved, the firm Achaian band<br />
	With brazen shields in horrid circle stand.<br />
	Jove, pouring darkness o&#39;er the mingled fight,<br />
	Conceals the warriors&#39; shining helms in night:<br />
	To him, the chief for whom the hosts contend<br />
	Had lived not hateful, for he lived a friend:<br />
	Dead he protects him with superior care.<br />
	Nor dooms his carcase to the birds of air.</p>
<p>
	The first attack the Grecians scarce sustain,<br />
	Repulsed, they yield; the Trojans seize the slain.<br />
	Then fierce they rally, to revenge led on<br />
	By the swift rage of Ajax Telamon.<br />
	(Ajax to Peleus&#39; son the second name,<br />
	In graceful stature next, and next in fame)<br />
	With headlong force the foremost ranks he tore;<br />
	So through the thicket bursts the mountain boar,<br />
	And rudely scatters, for a distance round,<br />
	The frighted hunter and the baying hound.<br />
	The son of Lethus, brave Pelasgus&#39; heir,<br />
	Hippothous, dragg&#39;d the carcase through the war;<br />
	The sinewy ankles bored, the feet he bound<br />
	With thongs inserted through the double wound:<br />
	Inevitable fate o&#39;ertakes the deed;<br />
	Doom&#39;d by great Ajax&#39; vengeful lance to bleed:<br />
	It cleft the helmet&#39;s brazen cheeks in twain;<br />
	The shatter&#39;d crest and horse&ndash;hair strow the plain:<br />
	With nerves relax&#39;d he tumbles to the ground:<br />
	The brain comes gushing through the ghastly wound:<br />
	He drops Patroclus&#39; foot, and o&#39;er him spread,<br />
	Now lies a sad companion of the dead:<br />
	Far from Larissa lies, his native air,<br />
	And ill requites his parents&#39; tender care.<br />
	Lamented youth! in life&#39;s first bloom he fell,<br />
	Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell.</p>
<p>
	Once more at Ajax Hector&#39;s javelin flies;<br />
	The Grecian marking, as it cut the skies,<br />
	Shunn&#39;d the descending death; which hissing on,<br />
	Stretch&#39;d in the dust the great Iphytus&#39; son,<br />
	Schedius the brave, of all the Phocian kind<br />
	The boldest warrior and the noblest mind:<br />
	In little Panope, for strength renown&#39;d,<br />
	He held his seat, and ruled the realms around.<br />
	Plunged in his throat, the weapon drank his blood,<br />
	And deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood;<br />
	In clanging arms the hero fell and all<br />
	The fields resounded with his weighty fall.</p>
<p>
	Phorcys, as slain Hippothous he defends,<br />
	The Telamonian lance his belly rends;<br />
	The hollow armour burst before the stroke,<br />
	And through the wound the rushing entrails broke:<br />
	In strong convulsions panting on the sands<br />
	He lies, and grasps the dust with dying hands.</p>
<p>
	Struck at the sight, recede the Trojan train:<br />
	The shouting Argives strip the heroes slain.<br />
	And now had Troy, by Greece compell&#39;d to yield,<br />
	Fled to her ramparts, and resign&#39;d the field;<br />
	Greece, in her native fortitude elate,<br />
	With Jove averse, had turn&#39;d the scale of fate:<br />
	But Phoebus urged &AElig;neas to the fight;<br />
	He seem&#39;d like aged Periphas to sight:<br />
	(A herald in Anchises&#39; love grown old,<br />
	Revered for prudence, and with prudence bold.)</p>
<p>
	Thus he&mdash;&quot;What methods yet, O chief! remain,<br />
	To save your Troy, though heaven its fall ordain?<br />
	There have been heroes, who, by virtuous care,<br />
	By valour, numbers, and by arts of war,<br />
	Have forced the powers to spare a sinking state,<br />
	And gain&#39;d at length the glorious odds of fate:<br />
	But you, when fortune smiles, when Jove declares<br />
	His partial favour, and assists your wars,<br />
	Your shameful efforts &#39;gainst yourselves employ,<br />
	And force the unwilling god to ruin Troy.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&AElig;neas through the form assumed descries<br />
	The power conceal&#39;d, and thus to Hector cries:<br />
	&quot;Oh lasting shame! to our own fears a prey,<br />
	We seek our ramparts, and desert the day.<br />
	A god, nor is he less, my bosom warms,<br />
	And tells me, Jove asserts the Trojan arms.&quot;</p>
<p>
	He spoke, and foremost to the combat flew:<br />
	The bold example all his hosts pursue.<br />
	Then, first, Leocritus beneath him bled,<br />
	In vain beloved by valiant Lycomede;<br />
	Who view&#39;d his fall, and, grieving at the chance,<br />
	Swift to revenge it sent his angry lance;<br />
	The whirling lance, with vigorous force address&#39;d,<br />
	Descends, and pants in Apisaon&#39;s breast;<br />
	From rich Paeonia&#39;s vales the warrior came,<br />
	Next thee, Asteropeus! in place and fame.<br />
	Asteropeus with grief beheld the slain,<br />
	And rush&#39;d to combat, but he rush&#39;d in vain:<br />
	Indissolubly firm, around the dead,<br />
	Rank within rank, on buckler buckler spread,<br />
	And hemm&#39;d with bristled spears, the Grecians stood,<br />
	A brazen bulwark, and an iron wood.<br />
	Great Ajax eyes them with incessant care,<br />
	And in an orb contracts the crowded war,<br />
	Close in their ranks commands to fight or fall,<br />
	And stands the centre and the soul of all:<br />
	Fix&#39;d on the spot they war, and wounded, wound<br />
	A sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground:<br />
	On heaps the Greeks, on heaps the Trojans bled,<br />
	And, thickening round them, rise the hills of dead.</p>
<p>
	Greece, in close order, and collected might,<br />
	Yet suffers least, and sways the wavering fight;<br />
	Fierce as conflicting fires the combat burns,<br />
	And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.<br />
	In one thick darkness all the fight was lost;<br />
	The sun, the moon, and all the ethereal host<br />
	Seem&#39;d as extinct: day ravish&#39;d from their eyes,<br />
	And all heaven&#39;s splendours blotted from the skies.<br />
	Such o&#39;er Patroclus&#39; body hung the night,<br />
	The rest in sunshine fought, and open light;<br />
	Unclouded there, the &AElig;rial azure spread,<br />
	No vapour rested on the mountain&#39;s head,<br />
	The golden sun pour&#39;d forth a stronger ray,<br />
	And all the broad expansion flamed with day.<br />
	Dispersed around the plain, by fits they fight,<br />
	And here and there their scatter&#39;d arrows light:<br />
	But death and darkness o&#39;er the carcase spread,<br />
	There burn&#39;d the war, and there the mighty bled.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile the sons of Nestor, in the rear,<br />
	(Their fellows routed,) toss the distant spear,<br />
	And skirmish wide: so Nestor gave command,<br />
	When from the ships he sent the Pylian band.<br />
	The youthful brothers thus for fame contend,<br />
	Nor knew the fortune of Achilles&#39; friend;<br />
	In thought they view&#39;d him still, with martial joy,<br />
	Glorious in arms, and dealing death to Troy.</p>
<p>
	But round the corse the heroes pant for breath,<br />
	And thick and heavy grows the work of death:<br />
	O&#39;erlabour&#39;d now, with dust, and sweat, and gore,<br />
	Their knees, their legs, their feet, are covered o&#39;er;<br />
	Drops follow drops, the clouds on clouds arise,<br />
	And carnage clogs their hands, and darkness fills their eyes.<br />
	As when a slaughter&#39;d bull&#39;s yet reeking hide,<br />
	Strain&#39;d with full force, and tugg&#39;d from side to side,<br />
	The brawny curriers stretch; and labour o&#39;er<br />
	The extended surface, drunk with fat and gore:<br />
	So tugging round the corse both armies stood;<br />
	The mangled body bathed in sweat and blood;<br />
	While Greeks and Ilians equal strength employ,<br />
	Now to the ships to force it, now to Troy.<br />
	Not Pallas&#39; self, her breast when fury warms,<br />
	Nor he whose anger sets the world in arms,<br />
	Could blame this scene; such rage, such horror reign&#39;d;<br />
	Such, Jove to honour the great dead ordain&#39;d.</p>
<p>
	Achilles in his ships at distance lay,<br />
	Nor knew the fatal fortune of the day;<br />
	He, yet unconscious of Patroclus&#39; fall,<br />
	In dust extended under Ilion&#39;s wall,<br />
	Expects him glorious from the conquered plain,<br />
	And for his wish&#39;d return prepares in vain;<br />
	Though well he knew, to make proud Ilion bend<br />
	Was more than heaven had destined to his friend.<br />
	Perhaps to him: this Thetis had reveal&#39;d;<br />
	The rest, in pity to her son, conceal&#39;d.</p>
<p>
	Still raged the conflict round the hero dead,<br />
	And heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled.<br />
	&quot;Cursed be the man (even private Greeks would say)<br />
	Who dares desert this well&ndash;disputed day!<br />
	First may the cleaving earth before our eyes<br />
	Gape wide, and drink our blood for sacrifice;<br />
	First perish all, ere haughty Troy shall boast<br />
	We lost Patroclus, and our glory lost!&quot;</p>
<p>
	Thus they: while with one voice the Trojans said,<br />
	&quot;Grant this day, Jove! or heap us on the dead!&quot;</p>
<p>
	Then clash their sounding arms; the clangours rise,<br />
	And shake the brazen concave of the skies.</p>
<p>
	Meantime, at distance from the scene of blood,<br />
	The pensive steeds of great Achilles stood:<br />
	Their godlike master slain before their eyes,<br />
	They wept, and shared in human miseries.<br />
	In vain Automedon now shakes the rein,<br />
	Now plies the lash, and soothes and threats in vain;<br />
	Nor to the fight nor Hellespont they go,<br />
	Restive they stood, and obstinate in woe:<br />
	Still as a tombstone, never to be moved,<br />
	On some good man or woman unreproved<br />
	Lays its eternal weight; or fix&#39;d, as stands<br />
	A marble courser by the sculptor&#39;s hands,<br />
	Placed on the hero&#39;s grave. Along their face<br />
	The big round drops coursed down with silent pace,<br />
	Conglobing on the dust. Their manes, that late<br />
	Circled their arched necks, and waved in state,<br />
	Trail&#39;d on the dust beneath the yoke were spread,<br />
	And prone to earth was hung their languid head:<br />
	Nor Jove disdain&#39;d to cast a pitying look,<br />
	While thus relenting to the steeds he spoke:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Unhappy coursers of immortal strain,<br />
	Exempt from age, and deathless, now in vain;<br />
	Did we your race on mortal man bestow,<br />
	Only, alas! to share in mortal woe?<br />
	For ah! what is there of inferior birth,<br />
	That breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth;<br />
	What wretched creature of what wretched kind,<br />
	Than man more weak, calamitous, and blind?<br />
	A miserable race! but cease to mourn:<br />
	For not by you shall Priam&#39;s son be borne<br />
	High on the splendid car: one glorious prize<br />
	He rashly boasts: the rest our will denies.<br />
	Ourself will swiftness to your nerves impart,<br />
	Ourself with rising spirits swell your heart.<br />
	Automedon your rapid flight shall bear<br />
	Safe to the navy through the storm of war.<br />
	For yet &#39;tis given to Troy to ravage o&#39;er<br />
	The field, and spread her slaughters to the shore;<br />
	The sun shall see her conquer, till his fall<br />
	With sacred darkness shades the face of all.&quot;</p>
<p>
	He said; and breathing in the immortal horse<br />
	Excessive spirit, urged them to the course;<br />
	From their high manes they shake the dust, and bear<br />
	The kindling chariot through the parted war:<br />
	So flies a vulture through the clamorous train<br />
	Of geese, that scream, and scatter round the plain.<br />
	From danger now with swiftest speed they flew,<br />
	And now to conquest with like speed pursue;<br />
	Sole in the seat the charioteer remains,<br />
	Now plies the javelin, now directs the reins:<br />
	Him brave Alcimedon beheld distress&#39;d,<br />
	Approach&#39;d the chariot, and the chief address&#39;d:</p>
<p>
	&quot;What god provokes thee rashly thus to dare,<br />
	Alone, unaided, in the thickest war?<br />
	Alas! thy friend is slain, and Hector wields<br />
	Achilles&#39; arms triumphant in the fields.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;In happy time (the charioteer replies)<br />
	The bold Alcimedon now greets my eyes;<br />
	No Greek like him the heavenly steeds restrains,<br />
	Or holds their fury in suspended reins:<br />
	Patroclus, while he lived, their rage could tame,<br />
	But now Patroclus is an empty name!<br />
	To thee I yield the seat, to thee resign<br />
	The ruling charge: the task of fight be mine.&quot;</p>
<p>
	He said. Alcimedon, with active heat,<br />
	Snatches the reins, and vaults into the seat.<br />
	His friend descends. The chief of Troy descried,<br />
	And call&#39;d &AElig;neas fighting near his side.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Lo, to my sight, beyond our hope restored,<br />
	Achilles&#39; car, deserted of its lord!<br />
	The glorious steeds our ready arms invite,<br />
	Scarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight.<br />
	Can such opponents stand when we assail?<br />
	Unite thy force, my friend, and we prevail.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The son of Venus to the counsel yields;<br />
	Then o&#39;er their backs they spread their solid shields:<br />
	With brass refulgent the broad surface shined,<br />
	And thick bull&ndash;hides the spacious concave lined.<br />
	Them Chromius follows, Aretus succeeds;<br />
	Each hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds:<br />
	In vain, brave youths, with glorious hopes ye burn,<br />
	In vain advance! not fated to return.</p>
<p>
	Unmov&#39;d, Automedon attends the fight,<br />
	Implores the Eternal, and collects his might.<br />
	Then turning to his friend, with dauntless mind:<br />
	&quot;Oh keep the foaming coursers close behind!<br />
	Full on my shoulders let their nostrils blow,<br />
	For hard the fight, determined is the foe;<br />
	&#39;Tis Hector comes: and when he seeks the prize,<br />
	War knows no mean; he wins it or he dies.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Then through the field he sends his voice aloud,<br />
	And calls the Ajaces from the warring crowd,<br />
	With great Atrides. &quot;Hither turn, (he said,)<br />
	Turn where distress demands immediate aid;<br />
	The dead, encircled by his friends, forego,<br />
	And save the living from a fiercer foe.<br />
	Unhelp&#39;d we stand, unequal to engage<br />
	The force of Hector, and &AElig;neas&#39; rage:<br />
	Yet mighty as they are, my force to prove<br />
	Is only mine: the event belongs to Jove.&quot;</p>
<p>
	He spoke, and high the sounding javelin flung,<br />
	Which pass&#39;d the shield of Aretus the young:<br />
	It pierced his belt, emboss&#39;d with curious art,<br />
	Then in the lower belly struck the dart.<br />
	As when a ponderous axe, descending full,<br />
	Cleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull:<br />
	Struck &#39;twixt the horns, he springs with many a bound,<br />
	Then tumbling rolls enormous on the ground:<br />
	Thus fell the youth; the air his soul received,<br />
	And the spear trembled as his entrails heaved.</p>
<p>
	Now at Automedon the Trojan foe<br />
	Discharged his lance; the meditated blow,<br />
	Stooping, he shunn&#39;d; the javelin idly fled,<br />
	And hiss&#39;d innoxious o&#39;er the hero&#39;s head;<br />
	Deep rooted in the ground, the forceful spear<br />
	In long vibrations spent its fury there.<br />
	With clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed,<br />
	But each brave Ajax heard, and interposed;<br />
	Nor longer Hector with his Trojans stood,<br />
	But left their slain companion in his blood:<br />
	His arms Automedon divests, and cries,<br />
	&quot;Accept, Patroclus, this mean sacrifice:<br />
	Thus have I soothed my griefs, and thus have paid,<br />
	Poor as it is, some offering to thy shade.&quot;</p>
<p>
	So looks the lion o&#39;er a mangled boar,<br />
	All grim with rage, and horrible with gore;<br />
	High on the chariot at one bound he sprung,<br />
	And o&#39;er his seat the bloody trophies hung.</p>
<p>
	And now Minerva from the realms of air<br />
	Descends impetuous, and renews the war;<br />
	For, pleased at length the Grecian arms to aid,<br />
	The lord of thunders sent the blue&ndash;eyed maid.<br />
	As when high Jove denouncing future woe,<br />
	O&#39;er the dark clouds extends his purple bow,<br />
	(In sign of tempests from the troubled air,<br />
	Or from the rage of man, destructive war,)<br />
	The drooping cattle dread the impending skies,<br />
	And from his half&ndash;till&#39;d field the labourer flies:<br />
	In such a form the goddess round her drew<br />
	A livid cloud, and to the battle flew.<br />
	Assuming Phoenix&#39; shape on earth she falls,<br />
	And in his well&ndash;known voice to Sparta calls:<br />
	&quot;And lies Achilles&#39; friend, beloved by all,<br />
	A prey to dogs beneath the Trojan wall?<br />
	What shame &#39;o Greece for future times to tell,<br />
	To thee the greatest in whose cause he fell!&quot;<br />
	&quot;O chief, O father! (Atreus&#39; son replies)<br />
	O full of days! by long experience wise!<br />
	What more desires my soul, than here unmoved<br />
	To guard the body of the man I loved?<br />
	Ah, would Minerva send me strength to rear<br />
	This wearied arm, and ward the storm of war!<br />
	But Hector, like the rage of fire, we dread,<br />
	And Jove&#39;s own glories blaze around his head!&quot;</p>
<p>
	Pleased to be first of all the powers address&#39;d,<br />
	She breathes new vigour in her hero&#39;s breast,<br />
	And fills with keen revenge, with fell despite,<br />
	Desire of blood, and rage, and lust of fight.<br />
	So burns the vengeful hornet (soul all o&#39;er),<br />
	Repulsed in vain, and thirsty still of gore;<br />
	(Bold son of air and heat) on angry wings<br />
	Untamed, untired, he turns, attacks, and stings.<br />
	Fired with like ardour fierce Atrides flew,<br />
	And sent his soul with every lance he threw.</p>
<p>
	There stood a Trojan, not unknown to fame,<br />
	&AElig;tion&#39;s son, and Podes was his name:<br />
	With riches honour&#39;d, and with courage bless&#39;d,<br />
	By Hector loved, his comrade, and his guest;<br />
	Through his broad belt the spear a passage found,<br />
	And, ponderous as he falls, his arms resound.<br />
	Sudden at Hector&#39;s side Apollo stood,<br />
	Like Phaenops, Asius&#39; son, appear&#39;d the god;<br />
	(Asius the great, who held his wealthy reign<br />
	In fair Abydos, by the rolling main.)</p>
<p>
	&quot;Oh prince! (he cried) Oh foremost once in fame!<br />
	What Grecian now shall tremble at thy name?<br />
	Dost thou at length to Menelaus yield,<br />
	A chief once thought no terror of the field?<br />
	Yet singly, now, the long&ndash;disputed prize<br />
	He bears victorious, while our army flies:<br />
	By the same arm illustrious Podes bled;<br />
	The friend of Hector, unrevenged, is dead!&quot;<br />
	This heard, o&#39;er Hector spreads a cloud of woe,<br />
	Rage lifts his lance, and drives him on the foe.</p>
<p>
	But now the Eternal shook his sable shield,<br />
	That shaded Ide and all the subject field<br />
	Beneath its ample verge. A rolling cloud<br />
	Involved the mount; the thunder roar&#39;d aloud;<br />
	The affrighted hills from their foundations nod,<br />
	And blaze beneath the lightnings of the god:<br />
	At one regard of his all&ndash;seeing eye<br />
	The vanquish&#39;d triumph, and the victors fly.</p>
<p>
	Then trembled Greece: the flight Peneleus led;<br />
	For as the brave Boeotian turn&#39;d his head<br />
	To face the foe, Polydamas drew near,<br />
	And razed his shoulder with a shorten&#39;d spear:<br />
	By Hector wounded, Leitus quits the plain,<br />
	Pierced through the wrist; and raging with the pain,<br />
	Grasps his once formidable lance in vain.</p>
<p>
	As Hector follow&#39;d, Idomen address&#39;d<br />
	The flaming javelin to his manly breast;<br />
	The brittle point before his corslet yields;<br />
	Exulting Troy with clamour fills the fields:<br />
	High on his chariots the Cretan stood,<br />
	The son of Priam whirl&#39;d the massive wood.<br />
	But erring from its aim, the impetuous spear<br />
	Struck to the dust the squire and charioteer<br />
	Of martial Merion: Coeranus his name,<br />
	Who left fair Lyctus for the fields of fame.<br />
	On foot bold Merion fought; and now laid low,<br />
	Had graced the triumphs of his Trojan foe,<br />
	But the brave squire the ready coursers brought,<br />
	And with his life his master&#39;s safety bought.<br />
	Between his cheek and ear the weapon went,<br />
	The teeth it shatter&#39;d, and the tongue it rent.<br />
	Prone from the seat he tumbles to the plain;<br />
	His dying hand forgets the falling rein:<br />
	This Merion reaches, bending from the car,<br />
	And urges to desert the hopeless war:<br />
	Idomeneus consents; the lash applies;<br />
	And the swift chariot to the navy flies.</p>
<p>
	Not Ajax less the will of heaven descried,<br />
	And conquest shifting to the Trojan side,<br />
	Turn&#39;d by the hand of Jove. Then thus begun,<br />
	To Atreus&#39;s seed, the godlike Telamon:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Alas! who sees not Jove&#39;s almighty hand<br />
	Transfers the glory to the Trojan band?<br />
	Whether the weak or strong discharge the dart,<br />
	He guides each arrow to a Grecian heart:<br />
	Not so our spears; incessant though they rain,<br />
	He suffers every lance to fall in vain.<br />
	Deserted of the god, yet let us try<br />
	What human strength and prudence can supply;<br />
	If yet this honour&#39;d corse, in triumph borne,<br />
	May glad the fleets that hope not our return,<br />
	Who tremble yet, scarce rescued from their fates,<br />
	And still hear Hector thundering at their gates.<br />
	Some hero too must be despatch&#39;d to bear<br />
	The mournful message to Pelides&#39; ear;<br />
	For sure he knows not, distant on the shore,<br />
	His friend, his loved Patroclus, is no more.<br />
	But such a chief I spy not through the host:<br />
	The men, the steeds, the armies, all are lost<br />
	In general darkness&mdash;Lord of earth and air!<br />
	Oh king! Oh father! hear my humble prayer:<br />
	Dispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore;<br />
	Give me to see, and Ajax asks no more:<br />
	If Greece must perish, we thy will obey,<br />
	But let us perish in the face of day!&quot;</p>
<p>
	With tears the hero spoke, and at his prayer<br />
	The god relenting clear&#39;d the clouded air;<br />
	Forth burst the sun with all&ndash;enlightening ray;<br />
	The blaze of armour flash&#39;d against the day.<br />
	&quot;Now, now, Atrides! cast around thy sight;<br />
	If yet Antilochus survives the fight,<br />
	Let him to great Achilles&#39; ear convey<br />
	The fatal news&quot;&mdash;Atrides hastes away.</p>
<p>
	So turns the lion from the nightly fold,<br />
	Though high in courage, and with hunger bold,<br />
	Long gall&#39;d by herdsmen, and long vex&#39;d by hounds,<br />
	Stiff with fatigue, and fretted sore with wounds;<br />
	The darts fly round him from a hundred hands,<br />
	And the red terrors of the blazing brands:<br />
	Till late, reluctant, at the dawn of day<br />
	Sour he departs, and quits the untasted prey,<br />
	So moved Atrides from his dangerous place<br />
	With weary limbs, but with unwilling pace;<br />
	The foe, he fear&#39;d, might yet Patroclus gain,<br />
	And much admonish&#39;d, much adjured his train:</p>
<p>
	&quot;O guard these relics to your charge consign&#39;d,<br />
	And bear the merits of the dead in mind;<br />
	How skill&#39;d he was in each obliging art;<br />
	The mildest manners, and the gentlest heart:<br />
	He was, alas! but fate decreed his end,<br />
	In death a hero, as in life a friend!&quot;</p>
<p>
	So parts the chief; from rank to rank he flew,<br />
	And round on all sides sent his piercing view.<br />
	As the bold bird, endued with sharpest eye<br />
	Of all that wings the mid &AElig;rial sky,<br />
	The sacred eagle, from his walks above<br />
	Looks down, and sees the distant thicket move;<br />
	Then stoops, and sousing on the quivering hare,<br />
	Snatches his life amid the clouds of air.<br />
	Not with less quickness, his exerted sight<br />
	Pass&#39;d this and that way, through the ranks of fight:<br />
	Till on the left the chief he sought, he found,<br />
	Cheering his men, and spreading deaths around:</p>
<p>
	To him the king: &quot;Beloved of Jove! draw near,<br />
	For sadder tidings never touch&#39;d thy ear;<br />
	Thy eyes have witness&#39;d what a fatal turn!<br />
	How Ilion triumphs, and the Achaians mourn.<br />
	This is not all: Patroclus, on the shore<br />
	Now pale and dead, shall succour Greece no more.<br />
	Fly to the fleet, this instant fly, and tell<br />
	The sad Achilles, how his loved&ndash;one fell:<br />
	He too may haste the naked corse to gain:<br />
	The arms are Hector&#39;s, who despoil&#39;d the slain.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The youthful warrior heard with silent woe,<br />
	From his fair eyes the tears began to flow:<br />
	Big with the mighty grief, he strove to say<br />
	What sorrow dictates, but no word found way.<br />
	To brave Laodocus his arms he flung,<br />
	Who, near him wheeling, drove his steeds along;<br />
	Then ran the mournful message to impart,<br />
	With tearful eyes, and with dejected heart.</p>
<p>
	Swift fled the youth: nor Menelaus stands<br />
	(Though sore distress&#39;d) to aid the Pylian bands;<br />
	But bids bold Thrasymede those troops sustain;<br />
	Himself returns to his Patroclus slain.<br />
	&quot;Gone is Antilochus (the hero said);<br />
	But hope not, warriors, for Achilles&#39; aid:<br />
	Though fierce his rage, unbounded be his woe,<br />
	Unarm&#39;d, he fights not with the Trojan foe.<br />
	&#39;Tis in our hands alone our hopes remain,<br />
	&#39;Tis our own vigour must the dead regain,<br />
	And save ourselves, while with impetuous hate<br />
	Troy pours along, and this way rolls our fate.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;&#39;Tis well (said Ajax), be it then thy care,<br />
	With Merion&#39;s aid, the weighty corse to rear;<br />
	Myself, and my bold brother will sustain<br />
	The shock of Hector and his charging train:<br />
	Nor fear we armies, fighting side by side;<br />
	What Troy can dare, we have already tried,<br />
	Have tried it, and have stood.&quot; The hero said.<br />
	High from the ground the warriors heave the dead.<br />
	A general clamour rises at the sight:<br />
	Loud shout the Trojans, and renew the fight.<br />
	Not fiercer rush along the gloomy wood,<br />
	With rage insatiate, and with thirst of blood,<br />
	Voracious hounds, that many a length before<br />
	Their furious hunters, drive the wounded boar;<br />
	But if the savage turns his glaring eye,<br />
	They howl aloof, and round the forest fly.<br />
	Thus on retreating Greece the Trojans pour,<br />
	Wave their thick falchions, and their javelins shower:<br />
	But Ajax turning, to their fears they yield,<br />
	All pale they tremble and forsake the field.</p>
<p>
	While thus aloft the hero&#39;s corse they bear,<br />
	Behind them rages all the storm of war:<br />
	Confusion, tumult, horror, o&#39;er the throng<br />
	Of men, steeds, chariots, urged the rout along:<br />
	Less fierce the winds with rising flames conspire<br />
	To whelm some city under waves of fire;<br />
	Now sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes,<br />
	Now crack the blazing temples of the gods;<br />
	The rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls,<br />
	And sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles.<br />
	The heroes sweat beneath their honour&#39;d load:<br />
	As when two mules, along the rugged road,<br />
	From the steep mountain with exerted strength<br />
	Drag some vast beam, or mast&#39;s unwieldy length;<br />
	Inly they groan, big drops of sweat distil,<br />
	The enormous timber lumbering down the hill:<br />
	So these&mdash;Behind, the bulk of Ajax stands,<br />
	And breaks the torrent of the rushing bands.<br />
	Thus when a river swell&#39;d with sudden rains<br />
	Spreads his broad waters o&#39;er the level plains,<br />
	Some interposing hill the stream divides.<br />
	And breaks its force, and turns the winding tides.<br />
	Still close they follow, close the rear engage;<br />
	&AElig;neas storms, and Hector foams with rage:<br />
	While Greece a heavy, thick retreat maintains,<br />
	Wedged in one body, like a flight of cranes,<br />
	That shriek incessant, while the falcon, hung<br />
	High on poised pinions, threats their callow young.<br />
	So from the Trojan chiefs the Grecians fly,<br />
	Such the wild terror, and the mingled cry:<br />
	Within, without the trench, and all the way,<br />
	Strow&#39;d in bright heaps, their arms and armour lay;<br />
	Such horror Jove impress&#39;d! yet still proceeds<br />
	The work of death, and still the battle bleeds.</p>
