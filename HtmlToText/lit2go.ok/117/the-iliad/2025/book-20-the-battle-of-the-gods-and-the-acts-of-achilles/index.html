                <p>
	Jupiter, upon Achilles&#39; return to the battle, calls a council of the gods, and permits them to assist either party. The terrors of the combat described, when the deities are engaged. Apollo encourages &AElig;neas to meet Achilles. After a long conversation, these two heroes encounter; but &AElig;neas is preserved by the assistance of Neptune. Achilles falls upon the rest of the Trojans, and is upon the point of killing Hector, but Apollo conveys him away in a cloud. Achilles pursues the Trojans with a great slaughter.</p>
<p>
	The same day continues. The scene is in the field before Troy.</p>
<p>
	Thus round Pelides breathing war and blood<br />
	Greece, sheathed in arms, beside her vessels stood;<br />
	While near impending from a neighbouring height,<br />
	Troy&#39;s black battalions wait the shock of fight.<br />
	Then Jove to Themis gives command, to call<br />
	The gods to council in the starry hall:<br />
	Swift o&#39;er Olympus&#39; hundred hills she flies,<br />
	And summons all the senate of the skies.<br />
	These shining on, in long procession come<br />
	To Jove&#39;s eternal adamantine dome.<br />
	Not one was absent, not a rural power<br />
	That haunts the verdant gloom, or rosy bower;<br />
	Each fair&ndash;hair&#39;d dryad of the shady wood,<br />
	Each azure sister of the silver flood;<br />
	All but old Ocean, hoary sire! who keeps<br />
	His ancient seat beneath the sacred deeps.<br />
	On marble thrones, with lucid columns crown&#39;d,<br />
	(The work of Vulcan,) sat the powers around.<br />
	Even he whose trident sways the watery reign<br />
	Heard the loud summons, and forsook the main,<br />
	Assumed his throne amid the bright abodes,<br />
	And question&#39;d thus the sire of men and gods:</p>
<p>
	&quot;What moves the god who heaven and earth commands,<br />
	And grasps the thunder in his awful hands,<br />
	Thus to convene the whole ethereal state?<br />
	Is Greece and Troy the subject in debate?<br />
	Already met, the louring hosts appear,<br />
	And death stands ardent on the edge of war.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;&#39;Tis true (the cloud&ndash;compelling power replies)<br />
	This day we call the council of the skies<br />
	In care of human race; even Jove&#39;s own eye<br />
	Sees with regret unhappy mortals die.<br />
	Far on Olympus&#39; top in secret state<br />
	Ourself will sit, and see the hand of fate<br />
	Work out our will. Celestial powers! descend,<br />
	And as your minds direct, your succour lend<br />
	To either host. Troy soon must lie o&#39;erthrown,<br />
	If uncontroll&#39;d Achilles fights alone:<br />
	Their troops but lately durst not meet his eyes;<br />
	What can they now, if in his rage he rise?<br />
	Assist them, gods! or Ilion&#39;s sacred wall<br />
	May fall this day, though fate forbids the fall.&quot;</p>
<p>
	He said, and fired their heavenly breasts with rage.<br />
	On adverse parts the warring gods engage:<br />
	Heaven&#39;s awful queen; and he whose azure round<br />
	Girds the vast globe; the maid in arms renown&#39;d;<br />
	Hermes, of profitable arts the sire;<br />
	And Vulcan, the black sovereign of the fire:<br />
	These to the fleet repair with instant flight;<br />
	The vessels tremble as the gods alight.<br />
	In aid of Troy, Latona, Phoebus came,<br />
	Mars fiery&ndash;helm&#39;d, the laughter&ndash;loving dame,<br />
	Xanthus, whose streams in golden currents flow,<br />
	And the chaste huntress of the silver bow.<br />
	Ere yet the gods their various aid employ,<br />
	Each Argive bosom swell&#39;d with manly joy,<br />
	While great Achilles (terror of the plain),<br />
	Long lost to battle, shone in arms again.<br />
	Dreadful he stood in front of all his host;<br />
	Pale Troy beheld, and seem&#39;d already lost;<br />
	Her bravest heroes pant with inward fear,<br />
	And trembling see another god of war.</p>
<p>
	But when the powers descending swell&#39;d the fight,<br />
	Then tumult rose: fierce rage and pale affright<br />
	Varied each face: then Discord sounds alarms,<br />
	Earth echoes, and the nations rush to arms.<br />
	Now through the trembling shores Minerva calls,<br />
	And now she thunders from the Grecian walls.<br />
	Mars hovering o&#39;er his Troy, his terror shrouds<br />
	In gloomy tempests, and a night of clouds:<br />
	Now through each Trojan heart he fury pours<br />
	With voice divine, from Ilion&#39;s topmost towers:<br />
	Now shouts to Simois, from her beauteous hill;<br />
	The mountain shook, the rapid stream stood still.</p>
<p>
	Above, the sire of gods his thunder rolls,<br />
	And peals on peals redoubled rend the poles.<br />
	Beneath, stern Neptune shakes the solid ground;<br />
	The forests wave, the mountains nod around;<br />
	Through all their summits tremble Ida&#39;s woods,<br />
	And from their sources boil her hundred floods.<br />
	Troy&#39;s turrets totter on the rocking plain,<br />
	And the toss&#39;d navies beat the heaving main.<br />
	Deep in the dismal regions of the dead,<br />
	The infernal monarch rear&#39;d his horrid head,<br />
	Leap&#39;d from his throne, lest Neptune&#39;s arm should lay<br />
	His dark dominions open to the day,<br />
	And pour in light on Pluto&#39;s drear abodes,<br />
	Abhorr&#39;d by men, and dreadful even to gods.</p>
<p>
	Such war the immortals wage; such horrors rend<br />
	The world&#39;s vast concave, when the gods contend<br />
	First silver&ndash;shafted Phoebus took the plain<br />
	Against blue Neptune, monarch of the main.<br />
	The god of arms his giant bulk display&#39;d,<br />
	Opposed to Pallas, war&#39;s triumphant maid.<br />
	Against Latona march&#39;d the son of May.<br />
	The quiver&#39;d Dian, sister of the day,<br />
	(Her golden arrows sounding at her side,)<br />
	Saturnia, majesty of heaven, defied.<br />
	With fiery Vulcan last in battle stands<br />
	The sacred flood that rolls on golden sands;<br />
	Xanthus his name with those of heavenly birth,<br />
	But called Scamander by the sons of earth.</p>
<p>
	While thus the gods in various league engage,<br />
	Achilles glow&#39;d with more than mortal rage:<br />
	Hector he sought; in search of Hector turn&#39;d<br />
	His eyes around, for Hector only burn&#39;d;<br />
	And burst like lightning through the ranks, and vow&#39;d<br />
	To glut the god of battles with his blood.</p>
<p>
	&AElig;neas was the first who dared to stay;<br />
	Apollo wedged him in the warrior&#39;s way,<br />
	But swell&#39;d his bosom with undaunted might,<br />
	Half&ndash;forced and half&ndash;persuaded to the fight.<br />
	Like young Lycaon, of the royal line,<br />
	In voice and aspect, seem&#39;d the power divine;<br />
	And bade the chief reflect, how late with scorn<br />
	In distant threats he braved the goddess&ndash;born.</p>
<p>
	Then thus the hero of Anchises&#39; strain:<br />
	&quot;To meet Pelides you persuade in vain:<br />
	Already have I met, nor void of fear<br />
	Observed the fury of his flying spear;<br />
	From Ida&#39;s woods he chased us to the field,<br />
	Our force he scattered, and our herds he kill&#39;d;<br />
	Lyrnessus, Pedasus in ashes lay;<br />
	But (Jove assisting) I survived the day:<br />
	Else had I sunk oppress&#39;d in fatal fight<br />
	By fierce Achilles and Minerva&#39;s might.<br />
	Where&#39;er he moved, the goddess shone before,<br />
	And bathed his brazen lance in hostile gore.<br />
	What mortal man Achilles can sustain?<br />
	The immortals guard him through the dreadful plain,<br />
	And suffer not his dart to fall in vain.<br />
	Were God my aid, this arm should check his power,<br />
	Though strong in battle as a brazen tower.&quot;</p>
<p>
	To whom the son of Jove: &quot;That god implore,<br />
	And be what great Achilles was before.<br />
	From heavenly Venus thou deriv&#39;st thy strain,<br />
	And he but from a sister of the main;<br />
	An aged sea&ndash;god father of his line;<br />
	But Jove himself the sacred source of thine.<br />
	Then lift thy weapon for a noble blow,<br />
	Nor fear the vaunting of a mortal foe.&quot;</p>
<p>
	This said, and spirit breathed into his breast,<br />
	Through the thick troops the embolden&#39;d hero press&#39;d:<br />
	His venturous act the white&ndash;arm&#39;d queen survey&#39;d,<br />
	And thus, assembling all the powers, she said:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Behold an action, gods! that claims your care,<br />
	Lo great &AElig;neas rushing to the war!<br />
	Against Pelides he directs his course,<br />
	Phoebus impels, and Phoebus gives him force.<br />
	Restrain his bold career; at least, to attend<br />
	Our favour&#39;d hero, let some power descend.<br />
	To guard his life, and add to his renown,<br />
	We, the great armament of heaven, came down.<br />
	Hereafter let him fall, as Fates design,<br />
	That spun so short his life&#39;s illustrious line:<br />
	But lest some adverse god now cross his way,<br />
	Give him to know what powers assist this day:<br />
	For how shall mortal stand the dire alarms,<br />
	When heaven&#39;s refulgent host appear in arms?&quot;</p>
<p>
	Thus she; and thus the god whose force can make<br />
	The solid globe&#39;s eternal basis shake:<br />
	&quot;Against the might of man, so feeble known,<br />
	Why should celestial powers exert their own?<br />
	Suffice from yonder mount to view the scene,<br />
	And leave to war the fates of mortal men.<br />
	But if the armipotent, or god of light,<br />
	Obstruct Achilles, or commence the fight.<br />
	Thence on the gods of Troy we swift descend:<br />
	Full soon, I doubt not, shall the conflict end;<br />
	And these, in ruin and confusion hurl&#39;d,<br />
	Yield to our conquering arms the lower world.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Thus having said, the tyrant of the sea,<br />
	Coerulean Neptune, rose, and led the way.<br />
	Advanced upon the field there stood a mound<br />
	Of earth congested, wall&#39;d, and trench&#39;d around;<br />
	In elder times to guard Alcides made,<br />
	(The work of Trojans, with Minerva&#39;s aid,)<br />
	What time a vengeful monster of the main<br />
	Swept the wide shore, and drove him to the plain.</p>
<p>
	Here Neptune and the gods of Greece repair,<br />
	With clouds encompass&#39;d, and a veil of air:<br />
	The adverse powers, around Apollo laid,<br />
	Crown the fair hills that silver Simois shade.<br />
	In circle close each heavenly party sat,<br />
	Intent to form the future scheme of fate;<br />
	But mix not yet in fight, though Jove on high<br />
	Gives the loud signal, and the heavens reply.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile the rushing armies hide the ground;<br />
	The trampled centre yields a hollow sound:<br />
	Steeds cased in mail, and chiefs in armour bright,<br />
	The gleaming champaign glows with brazen light.<br />
	Amid both hosts (a dreadful space) appear,<br />
	There great Achilles; bold &AElig;neas, here.<br />
	With towering strides &AElig;neas first advanced;<br />
	The nodding plumage on his helmet danced:<br />
	Spread o&#39;er his breast the fencing shield he bore,<br />
	And, so he moved, his javelin flamed before.<br />
	Not so Pelides; furious to engage,<br />
	He rush&#39;d impetuous. Such the lion&#39;s rage,<br />
	Who viewing first his foes with scornful eyes,<br />
	Though all in arms the peopled city rise,<br />
	Stalks careless on, with unregarding pride;<br />
	Till at the length, by some brave youth defied,<br />
	To his bold spear the savage turns alone,<br />
	He murmurs fury with a hollow groan;<br />
	He grins, he foams, he rolls his eyes around<br />
	Lash&#39;d by his tail his heaving sides resound;<br />
	He calls up all his rage; he grinds his teeth,<br />
	Resolved on vengeance, or resolved on death.<br />
	So fierce Achilles on &AElig;neas flies;<br />
	So stands &AElig;neas, and his force defies.<br />
	Ere yet the stern encounter join&#39;d, begun<br />
	The seed of Thetis thus to Venus&#39; son:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Why comes &AElig;neas through the ranks so far?<br />
	Seeks he to meet Achilles&#39; arm in war,<br />
	In hope the realms of Priam to enjoy,<br />
	And prove his merits to the throne of Troy?<br />
	Grant that beneath thy lance Achilles dies,<br />
	The partial monarch may refuse the prize;<br />
	Sons he has many; those thy pride may quell:<br />
	And &#39;tis his fault to love those sons too well,<br />
	Or, in reward of thy victorious hand,<br />
	Has Troy proposed some spacious tract of land<br />
	An ample forest, or a fair domain,<br />
	Of hills for vines, and arable for grain?<br />
	Even this, perhaps, will hardly prove thy lot.<br />
	But can Achilles be so soon forgot?<br />
	Once (as I think) you saw this brandish&#39;d spear<br />
	And then the great &AElig;neas seem&#39;d to fear:<br />
	With hearty haste from Ida&#39;s mount he fled,<br />
	Nor, till he reach&#39;d Lyrnessus, turn&#39;d his head.<br />
	Her lofty walls not long our progress stay&#39;d;<br />
	Those, Pallas, Jove, and we, in ruins laid:<br />
	In Grecian chains her captive race were cast;<br />
	&#39;Tis true, the great &AElig;neas fled too fast.<br />
	Defrauded of my conquest once before,<br />
	What then I lost, the gods this day restore.<br />
	Go; while thou may&#39;st, avoid the threaten&#39;d fate;<br />
	Fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.&quot;</p>
<p>
	To this Anchises&#39; son: &quot;Such words employ<br />
	To one that fears thee, some unwarlike boy;<br />
	Such we disdain; the best may be defied<br />
	With mean reproaches, and unmanly pride;<br />
	Unworthy the high race from which we came<br />
	Proclaim&#39;d so loudly by the voice of fame:<br />
	Each from illustrious fathers draws his line;<br />
	Each goddess&ndash;born; half human, half divine.<br />
	Thetis&#39; this day, or Venus&#39; offspring dies,<br />
	And tears shall trickle from celestial eyes:<br />
	For when two heroes, thus derived, contend,<br />
	&#39;Tis not in words the glorious strife can end.<br />
	If yet thou further seek to learn my birth<br />
	(A tale resounded through the spacious earth)<br />
	Hear how the glorious origin we prove<br />
	From ancient Dardanus, the first from Jove:<br />
	Dardania&#39;s walls he raised; for Ilion, then,<br />
	(The city since of many&ndash;languaged men,)<br />
	Was not. The natives were content to till<br />
	The shady foot of Ida&#39;s fountful hill.<br />
	From Dardanus great Erichthonius springs,<br />
	The richest, once, of Asia&#39;s wealthy kings;<br />
	Three thousand mares his spacious pastures bred,<br />
	Three thousand foals beside their mothers fed.<br />
	Boreas, enamour&#39;d of the sprightly train,<br />
	Conceal&#39;d his godhead in a flowing mane,<br />
	With voice dissembled to his loves he neigh&#39;d,<br />
	And coursed the dappled beauties o&#39;er the mead:<br />
	Hence sprung twelve others of unrivall&#39;d kind,<br />
	Swift as their mother mares, and father wind.<br />
	These lightly skimming, when they swept the plain,<br />
	Nor plied the grass, nor bent the tender grain;<br />
	And when along the level seas they flew,<br />
	Scarce on the surface curl&#39;d the briny dew.<br />
	Such Erichthonius was: from him there came<br />
	The sacred Tros, of whom the Trojan name.<br />
	Three sons renown&#39;d adorn&#39;d his nuptial bed,<br />
	Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymed:<br />
	The matchless Ganymed, divinely fair,<br />
	Whom heaven, enamour&#39;d, snatch&#39;d to upper air,<br />
	To bear the cup of Jove (ethereal guest,<br />
	The grace and glory of the ambrosial feast).<br />
	The two remaining sons the line divide:<br />
	First rose Laomedon from Ilus&#39; side;<br />
	From him Tithonus, now in cares grown old,<br />
	And Priam, bless&#39;d with Hector, brave and bold;<br />
	Clytius and Lampus, ever&ndash;honour&#39;d pair;<br />
	And Hicetaon, thunderbolt of war.<br />
	From great Assaracus sprang Capys, he<br />
	Begat Anchises, and Anchises me.<br />
	Such is our race: &#39;tis fortune gives us birth,<br />
	But Jove alone endues the soul with worth:<br />
	He, source of power and might! with boundless sway,<br />
	All human courage gives, or takes away.<br />
	Long in the field of words we may contend,<br />
	Reproach is infinite, and knows no end,<br />
	Arm&#39;d or with truth or falsehood, right or wrong;<br />
	So voluble a weapon is the tongue;<br />
	Wounded, we wound; and neither side can fail,<br />
	For every man has equal strength to rail:<br />
	Women alone, when in the streets they jar,<br />
	Perhaps excel us in this wordy war;<br />
	Like us they stand, encompass&#39;d with the crowd,<br />
	And vent their anger impotent and loud.<br />
	Cease then&mdash;Our business in the field of fight<br />
	Is not to question, but to prove our might.<br />
	To all those insults thou hast offer&#39;d here,<br />
	Receive this answer: &#39;tis my flying spear.&quot;</p>
<p>
	He spoke. With all his force the javelin flung,<br />
	Fix&#39;d deep, and loudly in the buckler rung.<br />
	Far on his outstretch&#39;d arm, Pelides held<br />
	(To meet the thundering lance) his dreadful shield,<br />
	That trembled as it stuck; nor void of fear<br />
	Saw, ere it fell, the immeasurable spear.<br />
	His fears were vain; impenetrable charms<br />
	Secured the temper of the ethereal arms.<br />
	Through two strong plates the point its passage held,<br />
	But stopp&#39;d, and rested, by the third repell&#39;d.<br />
	Five plates of various metal, various mould,<br />
	Composed the shield; of brass each outward fold,<br />
	Of tin each inward, and the middle gold:<br />
	There stuck the lance. Then rising ere he threw,<br />
	The forceful spear of great Achilles flew,<br />
	And pierced the Dardan shield&#39;s extremest bound,<br />
	Where the shrill brass return&#39;d a sharper sound:<br />
	Through the thin verge the Pelean weapon glides,<br />
	And the slight covering of expanded hides.<br />
	&AElig;neas his contracted body bends,<br />
	And o&#39;er him high the riven targe extends,<br />
	Sees, through its parting plates, the upper air,<br />
	And at his back perceives the quivering spear:<br />
	A fate so near him, chills his soul with fright;<br />
	And swims before his eyes the many&ndash;colour&#39;d light.<br />
	Achilles, rushing in with dreadful cries,<br />
	Draws his broad blade, and at &AElig;neas flies:<br />
	&AElig;neas rousing as the foe came on,<br />
	With force collected, heaves a mighty stone:<br />
	A mass enormous! which in modern days<br />
	No two of earth&#39;s degenerate sons could raise.<br />
	But ocean&#39;s god, whose earthquakes rock the ground.<br />
	Saw the distress, and moved the powers around:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Lo! on the brink of fate &AElig;neas stands,<br />
	An instant victim to Achilles&#39; hands;<br />
	By Phoebus urged; but Phoebus has bestow&#39;d<br />
	His aid in vain: the man o&#39;erpowers the god.<br />
	And can ye see this righteous chief atone<br />
	With guiltless blood for vices not his own?<br />
	To all the gods his constant vows were paid;<br />
	Sure, though he wars for Troy, he claims our aid.<br />
	Fate wills not this; nor thus can Jove resign<br />
	The future father of the Dardan line:<br />
	The first great ancestor obtain&#39;d his grace,<br />
	And still his love descends on all the race:<br />
	For Priam now, and Priam&#39;s faithless kind,<br />
	At length are odious to the all&ndash;seeing mind;<br />
	On great &AElig;neas shall devolve the reign,<br />
	And sons succeeding sons the lasting line sustain.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The great earth&ndash;shaker thus: to whom replies<br />
	The imperial goddess with the radiant eyes:<br />
	&quot;Good as he is, to immolate or spare<br />
	The Dardan prince, O Neptune! be thy care;<br />
	Pallas and I, by all that gods can bind,<br />
	Have sworn destruction to the Trojan kind;<br />
	Not even an instant to protract their fate,<br />
	Or save one member of the sinking state;<br />
	Till her last flame be quench&#39;d with her last gore,<br />
	And even her crumbling ruins are no more.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The king of ocean to the fight descends,<br />
	Through all the whistling darts his course he bends,<br />
	Swift interposed between the warrior flies,<br />
	And casts thick darkness o&#39;er Achilles&#39; eyes.<br />
	From great &AElig;neas&#39; shield the spear he drew,<br />
	And at his master&#39;s feet the weapon threw.<br />
	That done, with force divine he snatch&#39;d on high<br />
	The Dardan prince, and bore him through the sky,<br />
	Smooth&ndash;gliding without step, above the heads<br />
	Of warring heroes, and of bounding steeds:<br />
	Till at the battle&#39;s utmost verge they light,<br />
	Where the slow Caucans close the rear of fight.<br />
	The godhead there (his heavenly form confess&#39;d)<br />
	With words like these the panting chief address&#39;d:</p>
<p>
	&quot;What power, O prince! with force inferior far,<br />
	Urged thee to meet Achilles&#39; arm in war?<br />
	Henceforth beware, nor antedate thy doom,<br />
	Defrauding fate of all thy fame to come.<br />
	But when the day decreed (for come it must)<br />
	Shall lay this dreadful hero in the dust,<br />
	Let then the furies of that arm be known,<br />
	Secure no Grecian force transcends thy own.&quot;</p>
<p>
	With that, he left him wondering as he lay,<br />
	Then from Achilles chased the mist away:<br />
	Sudden, returning with a stream of light,<br />
	The scene of war came rushing on his sight.<br />
	Then thus, amazed; &quot;What wonders strike my mind!<br />
	My spear, that parted on the wings of wind,<br />
	Laid here before me! and the Dardan lord,<br />
	That fell this instant, vanish&#39;d from my sword!<br />
	I thought alone with mortals to contend,<br />
	But powers celestial sure this foe defend.<br />
	Great as he is, our arms he scarce will try,<br />
	Content for once, with all his gods, to fly.<br />
	Now then let others bleed.&quot; This said, aloud<br />
	He vents his fury and inflames the crowd:<br />
	&quot;O Greeks! (he cries, and every rank alarms)<br />
	Join battle, man to man, and arms to arms!<br />
	&#39;Tis not in me, though favour&#39;d by the sky,<br />
	To mow whole troops, and make whole armies fly:<br />
	No god can singly such a host engage,<br />
	Not Mars himself, nor great Minerva&#39;s rage.<br />
	But whatsoe&#39;er Achilles can inspire,<br />
	Whate&#39;er of active force, or acting fire;<br />
	Whate&#39;er this heart can prompt, or hand obey;<br />
	All, all Achilles, Greeks! is yours to&ndash;day.<br />
	Through yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear,<br />
	And thin the squadrons with my single spear.&quot;</p>
<p>
	He said: nor less elate with martial joy,<br />
	The godlike Hector warm&#39;d the troops of Troy:<br />
	&quot;Trojans, to war! Think, Hector leads you on;<br />
	Nor dread the vaunts of Peleus&#39; haughty son.<br />
	Deeds must decide our fate. E&#39;en these with words<br />
	Insult the brave, who tremble at their swords:<br />
	The weakest atheist&ndash;wretch all heaven defies,<br />
	But shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies.<br />
	Nor from yon boaster shall your chief retire,<br />
	Not though his heart were steel, his hands were fire;<br />
	That fire, that steel, your Hector should withstand,<br />
	And brave that vengeful heart, that dreadful hand.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Thus (breathing rage through all) the hero said;<br />
	A wood of lances rises round his head,<br />
	Clamours on clamours tempest all the air,<br />
	They join, they throng, they thicken to the war.<br />
	But Phoebus warns him from high heaven to shun<br />
	The single fight with Thetis&#39; godlike son;<br />
	More safe to combat in the mingled band,<br />
	Nor tempt too near the terrors of his hand.<br />
	He hears, obedient to the god of light,<br />
	And, plunged within the ranks, awaits the fight.</p>
<p>
	Then fierce Achilles, shouting to the skies,<br />
	On Troy&#39;s whole force with boundless fury flies.<br />
	First falls Iphytion, at his army&#39;s head;<br />
	Brave was the chief, and brave the host he led;<br />
	From great Otrynteus he derived his blood,<br />
	His mother was a Nais, of the flood;<br />
	Beneath the shades of Tmolus, crown&#39;d with snow,<br />
	From Hyde&#39;s walls he ruled the lands below.<br />
	Fierce as he springs, the sword his head divides:<br />
	The parted visage falls on equal sides:<br />
	With loud&ndash;resounding arms he strikes the plain;<br />
	While thus Achilles glories o&#39;er the slain:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Lie there, Otryntides! the Trojan earth<br />
	Receives thee dead, though Gygae boast thy birth;<br />
	Those beauteous fields where Hyllus&#39; waves are roll&#39;d,<br />
	And plenteous Hermus swells with tides of gold,<br />
	Are thine no more.&quot;&mdash;The insulting hero said,<br />
	And left him sleeping in eternal shade.<br />
	The rolling wheels of Greece the body tore,<br />
	And dash&#39;d their axles with no vulgar gore.</p>
<p>
	Demoleon next, Antenor&#39;s offspring, laid<br />
	Breathless in dust, the price of rashness paid.<br />
	The impatient steel with full&ndash;descending sway<br />
	Forced through his brazen helm its furious way,<br />
	Resistless drove the batter&#39;d skull before,<br />
	And dash&#39;d and mingled all the brains with gore.<br />
	This sees Hippodamas, and seized with fright,<br />
	Deserts his chariot for a swifter flight:<br />
	The lance arrests him: an ignoble wound<br />
	The panting Trojan rivets to the ground.<br />
	He groans away his soul: not louder roars,<br />
	At Neptune&#39;s shrine on Helice&#39;s high shores,<br />
	The victim bull; the rocks re&ndash;bellow round,<br />
	And ocean listens to the grateful sound.<br />
	Then fell on Polydore his vengeful rage,<br />
	The youngest hope of Priam&#39;s stooping age:<br />
	(Whose feet for swiftness in the race surpass&#39;d:)<br />
	Of all his sons, the dearest, and the last.<br />
	To the forbidden field he takes his flight,<br />
	In the first folly of a youthful knight,<br />
	To vaunt his swiftness wheels around the plain,<br />
	But vaunts not long, with all his swiftness slain:<br />
	Struck where the crossing belts unite behind,<br />
	And golden rings the double back&ndash;plate join&#39;d<br />
	Forth through the navel burst the thrilling steel;<br />
	And on his knees with piercing shrieks he fell;<br />
	The rushing entrails pour&#39;d upon the ground<br />
	His hands collect; and darkness wraps him round.<br />
	When Hector view&#39;d, all ghastly in his gore,<br />
	Thus sadly slain the unhappy Polydore,<br />
	A cloud of sorrow overcast his sight,<br />
	His soul no longer brook&#39;d the distant fight:<br />
	Full in Achilles&#39; dreadful front he came,<br />
	And shook his javelin like a waving flame.<br />
	The son of Peleus sees, with joy possess&#39;d,<br />
	His heart high&ndash;bounding in his rising breast.<br />
	&quot;And, lo! the man on whom black fates attend;<br />
	The man, that slew Achilles, is his friend!<br />
	No more shall Hector&#39;s and Pelides&#39; spear<br />
	Turn from each other in the walks of war.&quot;&mdash;<br />
	Then with revengeful eyes he scann&#39;d him o&#39;er:<br />
	&quot;Come, and receive thy fate!&quot; He spake no more.</p>
<p>
	Hector, undaunted, thus: &quot;Such words employ<br />
	To one that dreads thee, some unwarlike boy:<br />
	Such we could give, defying and defied,<br />
	Mean intercourse of obloquy and pride!<br />
	I know thy force to mine superior far;<br />
	But heaven alone confers success in war:<br />
	Mean as I am, the gods may guide my dart,<br />
	And give it entrance in a braver heart.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Then parts the lance: but Pallas&#39; heavenly breath<br />
	Far from Achilles wafts the winged death:<br />
	The bidden dart again to Hector flies,<br />
	And at the feet of its great master lies.<br />
	Achilles closes with his hated foe,<br />
	His heart and eyes with flaming fury glow:<br />
	But present to his aid, Apollo shrouds<br />
	The favour&#39;d hero in a veil of clouds.<br />
	Thrice struck Pelides with indignant heart,<br />
	Thrice in impassive air he plunged the dart;<br />
	The spear a fourth time buried in the cloud.<br />
	He foams with fury, and exclaims aloud:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Wretch! thou hast &#39;scaped again; once more thy flight<br />
	Has saved thee, and the partial god of light.<br />
	But long thou shalt not thy just fate withstand,<br />
	If any power assist Achilles&#39; hand.<br />
	Fly then inglorious! but thy flight this day<br />
	Whole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay.&quot;</p>
<p>
	With that, he gluts his rage on numbers slain:<br />
	Then Dryops tumbled to the ensanguined plain,<br />
	Pierced through the neck: he left him panting there,<br />
	And stopp&#39;d Demuchus, great Philetor&#39;s heir.<br />
	Gigantic chief! deep gash&#39;d the enormous blade,<br />
	And for the soul an ample passage made.<br />
	Laoganus and Dardanus expire,<br />
	The valiant sons of an unhappy sire;<br />
	Both in one instant from the chariot hurl&#39;d,<br />
	Sunk in one instant to the nether world:<br />
	This difference only their sad fates afford<br />
	That one the spear destroy&#39;d, and one the sword.</p>
<p>
	Nor less unpitied, young Alastor bleeds;<br />
	In vain his youth, in vain his beauty pleads;<br />
	In vain he begs thee, with a suppliant&#39;s moan,<br />
	To spare a form, an age so like thy own!<br />
	Unhappy boy! no prayer, no moving art,<br />
	E&#39;er bent that fierce, inexorable heart!<br />
	While yet he trembled at his knees, and cried,<br />
	The ruthless falchion oped his tender side;<br />
	The panting liver pours a flood of gore<br />
	That drowns his bosom till he pants no more.</p>
<p>
	Through Mulius&#39; head then drove the impetuous spear:<br />
	The warrior falls, transfix&#39;d from ear to ear.<br />
	Thy life, Echeclus! next the sword bereaves,<br />
	Deep though the front the ponderous falchion cleaves;<br />
	Warm&#39;d in the brain the smoking weapon lies,<br />
	The purple death comes floating o&#39;er his eyes.<br />
	Then brave Deucalion died: the dart was flung<br />
	Where the knit nerves the pliant elbow strung;<br />
	He dropp&#39;d his arm, an unassisting weight,<br />
	And stood all impotent, expecting fate:<br />
	Full on his neck the falling falchion sped,<br />
	From his broad shoulders hew&#39;d his crested head:<br />
	Forth from the bone the spinal marrow flies,<br />
	And, sunk in dust, the corpse extended lies.<br />
	Rhigmas, whose race from fruitful Thracia came,<br />
	(The son of Pierus, an illustrious name,)<br />
	Succeeds to fate: the spear his belly rends;<br />
	Prone from his car the thundering chief descends.<br />
	The squire, who saw expiring on the ground<br />
	His prostrate master, rein&#39;d the steeds around;<br />
	His back, scarce turn&#39;d, the Pelian javelin gored,<br />
	And stretch&#39;d the servant o&#39;er his dying lord.<br />
	As when a flame the winding valley fills,<br />
	And runs on crackling shrubs between the hills;<br />
	Then o&#39;er the stubble up the mountain flies,<br />
	Fires the high woods, and blazes to the skies,<br />
	This way and that, the spreading torrent roars:<br />
	So sweeps the hero through the wasted shores;<br />
	Around him wide, immense destruction pours<br />
	And earth is deluged with the sanguine showers<br />
	As with autumnal harvests cover&#39;d o&#39;er,<br />
	And thick bestrewn, lies Ceres&#39; sacred floor;<br />
	When round and round, with never&ndash;wearied pain,<br />
	The trampling steers beat out the unnumber&#39;d grain:<br />
	So the fierce coursers, as the chariot rolls,<br />
	Tread down whole ranks, and crush out heroes&#39; souls,<br />
	Dash&#39;d from their hoofs while o&#39;er the dead they fly,<br />
	Black, bloody drops the smoking chariot dye:<br />
	The spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore;<br />
	And thick the groaning axles dropp&#39;d with gore.<br />
	High o&#39;er the scene of death Achilles stood,<br />
	All grim with dust, all horrible in blood:<br />
	Yet still insatiate, still with rage on flame;<br />
	Such is the lust of never&ndash;dying fame!</p>
