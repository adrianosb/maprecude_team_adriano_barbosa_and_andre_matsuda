                <p>
	Diomed, assisted by Pallas, performs wonders in this day&#39;s battle. Pandarus wounds him with an arrow, but the goddess cures him, enables him to discern gods from mortals, and prohibits him from contending with any of the former, excepting Venus. &AElig;neas joins Pandarus to oppose him; Pandarus is killed, and &AElig;neas in great danger but for the assistance of Venus; who, as she is removing her son from the fight, is wounded on the hand by Diomed. Apollo seconds her in his rescue, and at length carries off &AElig;neas to Troy, where he is healed in the temple of Pergamus. Mars rallies the Trojans, and assists Hector to make a stand. In the meantime AEneas is restored to the field, and they overthrow several of the Greeks; among the rest Tlepolemus is slain by Sarpedon. Juno and Minerva descend to resist Mars; the latter incites Diomed to go against that god; he wounds him, and sends him groaning to heaven.</p>
<p>
	The first battle continues through this book. The scene is the same as in the former.</p>
<p>
	But Pallas now Tydides&#39; soul inspires,<br />
	Fills with her force, and warms with all her fires,<br />
	Above the Greeks his deathless fame to raise,<br />
	And crown her hero with distinguish&#39;d praise.<br />
	High on his helm celestial lightnings play,<br />
	His beamy shield emits a living ray;<br />
	The unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies,<br />
	Like the red star that fires the autumnal skies,<br />
	When fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight,<br />
	And, bathed in ocean, shoots a keener light.<br />
	Such glories Pallas on the chief bestow&#39;d,<br />
	Such, from his arms, the fierce effulgence flow&#39;d:<br />
	Onward she drives him, furious to engage,<br />
	Where the fight burns, and where the thickest rage.</p>
<p>
	The sons of Dares first the combat sought,<br />
	A wealthy priest, but rich without a fault;<br />
	In Vulcan&#39;s fane the father&#39;s days were led,<br />
	The sons to toils of glorious battle bred;<br />
	These singled from their troops the fight maintain,<br />
	These, from their steeds, Tydides on the plain.<br />
	Fierce for renown the brother&ndash;chiefs draw near,<br />
	And first bold Phegeus cast his sounding spear,<br />
	Which o&#39;er the warrior&#39;s shoulder took its course,<br />
	And spent in empty air its erring force.<br />
	Not so, Tydides, flew thy lance in vain,<br />
	But pierced his breast, and stretch&#39;d him on the plain.<br />
	Seized with unusual fear, Idaeus fled,<br />
	Left the rich chariot, and his brother dead.<br />
	And had not Vulcan lent celestial aid,<br />
	He too had sunk to death&#39;s eternal shade;<br />
	But in a smoky cloud the god of fire<br />
	Preserved the son, in pity to the sire.<br />
	The steeds and chariot, to the navy led,<br />
	Increased the spoils of gallant Diomed.</p>
<p>
	Struck with amaze and shame, the Trojan crew,<br />
	Or slain, or fled, the sons of Dares view;<br />
	When by the blood&ndash;stain&#39;d hand Minerva press&#39;d<br />
	The god of battles, and this speech address&#39;d:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Stern power of war! by whom the mighty fall,<br />
	Who bathe in blood, and shake the lofty wall!<br />
	Let the brave chiefs their glorious toils divide;<br />
	And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide:<br />
	While we from interdicted fields retire,<br />
	Nor tempt the wrath of heaven&#39;s avenging sire.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Her words allay the impetuous warrior&#39;s heat,<br />
	The god of arms and martial maid retreat;<br />
	Removed from fight, on Xanthus&#39; flowery bounds<br />
	They sat, and listen&#39;d to the dying sounds.</p>
<p>
	Meantime, the Greeks the Trojan race pursue,<br />
	And some bold chieftain every leader slew:<br />
	First Odius falls, and bites the bloody sand,<br />
	His death ennobled by Atrides&#39; hand:</p>
<p>
	As he to flight his wheeling car address&#39;d,<br />
	The speedy javelin drove from back to breast.<br />
	In dust the mighty Halizonian lay,<br />
	His arms resound, the spirit wings its way.</p>
<p>
	Thy fate was next, O Phaestus! doom&#39;d to feel<br />
	The great Idomeneus&#39; protended steel;<br />
	Whom Borus sent (his son and only joy)<br />
	From fruitful Tarne to the fields of Troy.<br />
	The Cretan javelin reach&#39;d him from afar,<br />
	And pierced his shoulder as he mounts his car;<br />
	Back from the car he tumbles to the ground,<br />
	And everlasting shades his eyes surround.</p>
<p>
	Then died Scamandrius, expert in the chase,<br />
	In woods and wilds to wound the savage race;<br />
	Diana taught him all her sylvan arts,<br />
	To bend the bow, and aim unerring darts:<br />
	But vainly here Diana&#39;s arts he tries,<br />
	The fatal lance arrests him as he flies;<br />
	From Menelaus&#39; arm the weapon sent,<br />
	Through his broad back and heaving bosom went:<br />
	Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,<br />
	His brazen armour rings against the ground.</p>
<p>
	Next artful Phereclus untimely fell;<br />
	Bold Merion sent him to the realms of hell.<br />
	Thy father&#39;s skill, O Phereclus! was thine,<br />
	The graceful fabric and the fair design;<br />
	For loved by Pallas, Pallas did impart<br />
	To him the shipwright&#39;s and the builder&#39;s art.<br />
	Beneath his hand the fleet of Paris rose,<br />
	The fatal cause of all his country&#39;s woes;<br />
	But he, the mystic will of heaven unknown,<br />
	Nor saw his country&#39;s peril, nor his own.<br />
	The hapless artist, while confused he fled,<br />
	The spear of Merion mingled with the dead.<br />
	Through his right hip, with forceful fury cast,<br />
	Between the bladder and the bone it pass&#39;d;<br />
	Prone on his knees he falls with fruitless cries,<br />
	And death in lasting slumber seals his eyes.</p>
<p>
	From Meges&#39; force the swift Pedaeus fled,<br />
	Antenor&#39;s offspring from a foreign bed,<br />
	Whose generous spouse, Theanor, heavenly fair,<br />
	Nursed the young stranger with a mother&#39;s care.<br />
	How vain those cares! when Meges in the rear<br />
	Full in his nape infix&#39;d the fatal spear;<br />
	Swift through his crackling jaws the weapon glides,<br />
	And the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides.</p>
<p>
	Then died Hypsenor, generous and divine,<br />
	Sprung from the brave Dolopion&#39;s mighty line,<br />
	Who near adored Scamander made abode,<br />
	Priest of the stream, and honoured as a god.<br />
	On him, amidst the flying numbers found,<br />
	Eurypylus inflicts a deadly wound;<br />
	On his broad shoulders fell the forceful brand,<br />
	Thence glancing downwards, lopp&#39;d his holy hand,<br />
	Which stain&#39;d with sacred blood the blushing sand.<br />
	Down sunk the priest: the purple hand of death<br />
	Closed his dim eye, and fate suppress&#39;d his breath.</p>
<p>
	Thus toil&#39;d the chiefs, in different parts engaged.<br />
	In every quarter fierce Tydides raged;<br />
	Amid the Greek, amid the Trojan train,<br />
	Rapt through the ranks he thunders o&#39;er the plain;<br />
	Now here, now there, he darts from place to place,<br />
	Pours on the rear, or lightens in their face.<br />
	Thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong<br />
	Deluge whole fields, and sweep the trees along,<br />
	Through ruin&#39;d moles the rushing wave resounds,<br />
	O&#39;erwhelm&#39;s the bridge, and bursts the lofty bounds;<br />
	The yellow harvests of the ripen&#39;d year,<br />
	And flatted vineyards, one sad waste appear!<br />
	While Jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain,<br />
	And all the labours of mankind are vain.</p>
<p>
	So raged Tydides, boundless in his ire,<br />
	Drove armies back, and made all Troy retire.<br />
	With grief the leader of the Lycian band<br />
	Saw the wide waste of his destructive hand:<br />
	His bended bow against the chief he drew;<br />
	Swift to the mark the thirsty arrow flew,<br />
	Whose forky point the hollow breastplate tore,<br />
	Deep in his shoulder pierced, and drank the gore:<br />
	The rushing stream his brazen armour dyed,<br />
	While the proud archer thus exulting cried:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Hither, ye Trojans, hither drive your steeds!<br />
	Lo! by our hand the bravest Grecian bleeds,<br />
	Not long the deathful dart he can sustain;<br />
	Or Phoebus urged me to these fields in vain.&quot;<br />
	So spoke he, boastful: but the winged dart<br />
	Stopp&#39;d short of life, and mock&#39;d the shooter&#39;s art.<br />
	The wounded chief, behind his car retired,<br />
	The helping hand of Sthenelus required;<br />
	Swift from his seat he leap&#39;d upon the ground,<br />
	And tugg&#39;d the weapon from the gushing wound;<br />
	When thus the king his guardian power address&#39;d,<br />
	The purple current wandering o&#39;er his vest:</p>
<p>
	&quot;O progeny of Jove! unconquer&#39;d maid!<br />
	If e&#39;er my godlike sire deserved thy aid,<br />
	If e&#39;er I felt thee in the fighting field;<br />
	Now, goddess, now, thy sacred succour yield.<br />
	O give my lance to reach the Trojan knight,<br />
	Whose arrow wounds the chief thou guard&#39;st in fight;<br />
	And lay the boaster grovelling on the shore,<br />
	That vaunts these eyes shall view the light no more.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Thus pray&#39;d Tydides, and Minerva heard,<br />
	His nerves confirm&#39;d, his languid spirits cheer&#39;d;<br />
	He feels each limb with wonted vigour light;<br />
	His beating bosom claim&#39;d the promised fight.<br />
	&quot;Be bold, (she cried), in every combat shine,<br />
	War be thy province, thy protection mine;<br />
	Rush to the fight, and every foe control;<br />
	Wake each paternal virtue in thy soul:<br />
	Strength swells thy boiling breast, infused by me,<br />
	And all thy godlike father breathes in thee;<br />
	Yet more, from mortal mists I purge thy eyes,<br />
	And set to view the warring deities.<br />
	These see thou shun, through all the embattled plain;<br />
	Nor rashly strive where human force is vain.<br />
	If Venus mingle in the martial band,<br />
	Her shalt thou wound: so Pallas gives command.&quot;</p>
<p>
	With that, the blue&ndash;eyed virgin wing&#39;d her flight;<br />
	The hero rush&#39;d impetuous to the fight;<br />
	With tenfold ardour now invades the plain,<br />
	Wild with delay, and more enraged by pain.<br />
	As on the fleecy flocks when hunger calls,<br />
	Amidst the field a brindled lion falls;<br />
	If chance some shepherd with a distant dart<br />
	The savage wound, he rouses at the smart,<br />
	He foams, he roars; the shepherd dares not stay,<br />
	But trembling leaves the scattering flocks a prey;<br />
	Heaps fall on heaps; he bathes with blood the ground,<br />
	Then leaps victorious o&#39;er the lofty mound.<br />
	Not with less fury stern Tydides flew;<br />
	And two brave leaders at an instant slew;<br />
	Astynous breathless fell, and by his side,<br />
	His people&#39;s pastor, good Hypenor, died;<br />
	Astynous&#39; breast the deadly lance receives,<br />
	Hypenor&#39;s shoulder his broad falchion cleaves.<br />
	Those slain he left, and sprung with noble rage<br />
	Abas and Polyidus to engage;<br />
	Sons of Eurydamus, who, wise and old,<br />
	Could fate foresee, and mystic dreams unfold;<br />
	The youths return&#39;d not from the doubtful plain,<br />
	And the sad father tried his arts in vain;<br />
	No mystic dream could make their fates appear,<br />
	Though now determined by Tydides&#39; spear.</p>
<p>
	Young Xanthus next, and Thoon felt his rage;<br />
	The joy and hope of Phaenops&#39; feeble age:<br />
	Vast was his wealth, and these the only heirs<br />
	Of all his labours and a life of cares.<br />
	Cold death o&#39;ertakes them in their blooming years,<br />
	And leaves the father unavailing tears:<br />
	To strangers now descends his heapy store,<br />
	The race forgotten, and the name no more.</p>
<p>
	Two sons of Priam in one chariot ride,<br />
	Glittering in arms, and combat side by side.<br />
	As when the lordly lion seeks his food<br />
	Where grazing heifers range the lonely wood,<br />
	He leaps amidst them with a furious bound,<br />
	Bends their strong necks, and tears them to the ground:<br />
	So from their seats the brother chiefs are torn,<br />
	Their steeds and chariot to the navy borne.</p>
<p>
	With deep concern divine &AElig;neas view&#39;d<br />
	The foe prevailing, and his friends pursued;<br />
	Through the thick storm of singing spears he flies,<br />
	Exploring Pandarus with careful eyes.<br />
	At length he found Lycaon&#39;s mighty son;<br />
	To whom the chief of Venus&#39; race begun:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Where, Pandarus, are all thy honours now,<br />
	Thy winged arrows and unerring bow,<br />
	Thy matchless skill, thy yet unrivall&#39;d fame,<br />
	And boasted glory of the Lycian name?<br />
	O pierce that mortal! if we mortal call<br />
	That wondrous force by which whole armies fall;<br />
	Or god incensed, who quits the distant skies<br />
	To punish Troy for slighted sacrifice;<br />
	(Which, oh avert from our unhappy state!<br />
	For what so dreadful as celestial hate)?<br />
	Whoe&#39;er he be, propitiate Jove with prayer;<br />
	If man, destroy; if god, entreat to spare.&quot;</p>
<p>
	To him the Lycian: &quot;Whom your eyes behold,<br />
	If right I judge, is Diomed the bold:<br />
	Such coursers whirl him o&#39;er the dusty field,<br />
	So towers his helmet, and so flames his shield.<br />
	If &#39;tis a god, he wears that chief&#39;s disguise:<br />
	Or if that chief, some guardian of the skies,<br />
	Involved in clouds, protects him in the fray,<br />
	And turns unseen the frustrate dart away.<br />
	I wing&#39;d an arrow, which not idly fell,<br />
	The stroke had fix&#39;d him to the gates of hell;<br />
	And, but some god, some angry god withstands,<br />
	His fate was due to these unerring hands.<br />
	Skill&#39;d in the bow, on foot I sought the war,<br />
	Nor join&#39;d swift horses to the rapid car.<br />
	Ten polish&#39;d chariots I possess&#39;d at home,<br />
	And still they grace Lycaon&#39;s princely dome:<br />
	There veil&#39;d in spacious coverlets they stand;<br />
	And twice ten coursers wait their lord&#39;s command.<br />
	The good old warrior bade me trust to these,<br />
	When first for Troy I sail&#39;d the sacred seas;<br />
	In fields, aloft, the whirling car to guide,<br />
	And through the ranks of death triumphant ride.<br />
	But vain with youth, and yet to thrift inclined,<br />
	I heard his counsels with unheedful mind,<br />
	And thought the steeds (your large supplies unknown)<br />
	Might fail of forage in the straiten&#39;d town;<br />
	So took my bow and pointed darts in hand<br />
	And left the chariots in my native land.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Too late, O friend! my rashness I deplore;<br />
	These shafts, once fatal, carry death no more.<br />
	Tydeus&#39; and Atreus&#39; sons their points have found,<br />
	And undissembled gore pursued the wound.<br />
	In vain they bleed: this unavailing bow<br />
	Serves, not to slaughter, but provoke the foe.<br />
	In evil hour these bended horns I strung,<br />
	And seized the quiver where it idly hung.<br />
	Cursed be the fate that sent me to the field<br />
	Without a warrior&#39;s arms, the spear and shield!<br />
	If e&#39;er with life I quit the Trojan plain,<br />
	If e&#39;er I see my spouse and sire again,<br />
	This bow, unfaithful to my glorious aims,<br />
	Broke by my hand, shall feed the blazing flames.&quot;</p>
<p>
	To whom the leader of the Dardan race:<br />
	&quot;Be calm, nor Phoebus&#39; honour&#39;d gift disgrace.<br />
	The distant dart be praised, though here we need<br />
	The rushing chariot and the bounding steed.<br />
	Against yon hero let us bend our course,<br />
	And, hand to hand, encounter force with force.<br />
	Now mount my seat, and from the chariot&#39;s height<br />
	Observe my father&#39;s steeds, renown&#39;d in fight;<br />
	Practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,<br />
	To dare the shock, or urge the rapid race;<br />
	Secure with these, through fighting fields we go;<br />
	Or safe to Troy, if Jove assist the foe.<br />
	Haste, seize the whip, and snatch the guiding rein;<br />
	The warrior&#39;s fury let this arm sustain;<br />
	Or, if to combat thy bold heart incline,<br />
	Take thou the spear, the chariot&#39;s care be mine.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&quot;O prince! (Lycaon&#39;s valiant son replied)<br />
	As thine the steeds, be thine the task to guide.<br />
	The horses, practised to their lord&#39;s command,<br />
	Shall bear the rein, and answer to thy hand;<br />
	But, if, unhappy, we desert the fight,<br />
	Thy voice alone can animate their flight;<br />
	Else shall our fates be number&#39;d with the dead,<br />
	And these, the victor&#39;s prize, in triumph led.<br />
	Thine be the guidance, then: with spear and shield<br />
	Myself will charge this terror of the field.&quot;</p>
<p>
	And now both heroes mount the glittering car;<br />
	The bounding coursers rush amidst the war;<br />
	Their fierce approach bold Sthenelus espied,<br />
	Who thus, alarm&#39;d, to great Tydides cried:</p>
<p>
	&quot;O friend! two chiefs of force immense I see,<br />
	Dreadful they come, and bend their rage on thee:<br />
	Lo the brave heir of old Lycaon&#39;s line,<br />
	And great &AElig;neas, sprung from race divine!<br />
	Enough is given to fame. Ascend thy car!<br />
	And save a life, the bulwark of our war.&quot;</p>
<p>
	At this the hero cast a gloomy look,<br />
	Fix&#39;d on the chief with scorn; and thus he spoke:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Me dost thou bid to shun the coming fight?<br />
	Me wouldst thou move to base, inglorious flight?<br />
	Know, &#39;tis not honest in my soul to fear,<br />
	Nor was Tydides born to tremble here.<br />
	I hate the cumbrous chariot&#39;s slow advance,<br />
	And the long distance of the flying lance;<br />
	But while my nerves are strong, my force entire,<br />
	Thus front the foe, and emulate my sire.<br />
	Nor shall yon steeds, that fierce to fight convey<br />
	Those threatening heroes, bear them both away;<br />
	One chief at least beneath this arm shall die;<br />
	So Pallas tells me, and forbids to fly.<br />
	But if she dooms, and if no god withstand,<br />
	That both shall fall by one victorious hand,<br />
	Then heed my words: my horses here detain,<br />
	Fix&#39;d to the chariot by the straiten&#39;d rein;<br />
	Swift to &AElig;neas&#39; empty seat proceed,<br />
	And seize the coursers of ethereal breed;<br />
	The race of those, which once the thundering god<br />
	For ravish&#39;d Ganymede on Tros bestow&#39;d,<br />
	The best that e&#39;er on earth&#39;s broad surface run,<br />
	Beneath the rising or the setting sun.<br />
	Hence great Anchises stole a breed unknown,<br />
	By mortal mares, from fierce Laomedon:<br />
	Four of this race his ample stalls contain,<br />
	And two transport &AElig;neas o&#39;er the plain.<br />
	These, were the rich immortal prize our own,<br />
	Through the wide world should make our glory known.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Thus while they spoke, the foe came furious on,<br />
	And stern Lycaon&#39;s warlike race begun:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Prince, thou art met. Though late in vain assail&#39;d,<br />
	The spear may enter where the arrow fail&#39;d.&quot;</p>
<p>
	He said, then shook the ponderous lance, and flung;<br />
	On his broad shield the sounding weapon rung,<br />
	Pierced the tough orb, and in his cuirass hung,<br />
	&quot;He bleeds! the pride of Greece! (the boaster cries,)<br />
	Our triumph now, the mighty warrior lies!&quot;<br />
	&quot;Mistaken vaunter! (Diomed replied;)<br />
	Thy dart has erred, and now my spear be tried;<br />
	Ye &#39;scape not both; one, headlong from his car,<br />
	With hostile blood shall glut the god of war.&quot;</p>
<p>
	He spoke, and rising hurl&#39;d his forceful dart,<br />
	Which, driven by Pallas, pierced a vital part;<br />
	Full in his face it enter&#39;d, and betwixt<br />
	The nose and eye&ndash;ball the proud Lycian fix&#39;d;<br />
	Crash&#39;d all his jaws, and cleft the tongue within,<br />
	Till the bright point look&#39;d out beneath the chin.<br />
	Headlong he falls, his helmet knocks the ground:<br />
	Earth groans beneath him, and his arms resound;<br />
	The starting coursers tremble with affright;<br />
	The soul indignant seeks the realms of night.</p>
<p>
	To guard his slaughter&#39;d friend, &AElig;neas flies,<br />
	His spear extending where the carcase lies;<br />
	Watchful he wheels, protects it every way,<br />
	As the grim lion stalks around his prey.<br />
	O&#39;er the fall&#39;n trunk his ample shield display&#39;d,<br />
	He hides the hero with his mighty shade,<br />
	And threats aloud! the Greeks with longing eyes<br />
	Behold at distance, but forbear the prize.<br />
	Then fierce Tydides stoops; and from the fields<br />
	Heaved with vast force, a rocky fragment wields.<br />
	Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,<br />
	Such men as live in these degenerate days:<br />
	He swung it round; and, gathering strength to throw,<br />
	Discharged the ponderous ruin at the foe.<br />
	Where to the hip the inserted thigh unites,<br />
	Full on the bone the pointed marble lights;<br />
	Through both the tendons broke the rugged stone,<br />
	And stripp&#39;d the skin, and crack&#39;d the solid bone.<br />
	Sunk on his knees, and staggering with his pains,<br />
	His falling bulk his bended arm sustains;<br />
	Lost in a dizzy mist the warrior lies;<br />
	A sudden cloud comes swimming o&#39;er his eyes.<br />
	There the brave chief, who mighty numbers sway&#39;d,<br />
	Oppress&#39;d had sunk to death&#39;s eternal shade,<br />
	But heavenly Venus, mindful of the love<br />
	She bore Anchises in the Idaean grove,<br />
	His danger views with anguish and despair,<br />
	And guards her offspring with a mother&#39;s care.<br />
	About her much&ndash;loved son her arms she throws,<br />
	Her arms whose whiteness match the falling snows.<br />
	Screen&#39;d from the foe behind her shining veil,<br />
	The swords wave harmless, and the javelins fail;<br />
	Safe through the rushing horse, and feather&#39;d flight<br />
	Of sounding shafts, she bears him from the fight.</p>
<p>
	Nor Sthenelus, with unassisting hands,<br />
	Remain&#39;d unheedful of his lord&#39;s commands:<br />
	His panting steeds, removed from out the war,<br />
	He fix&#39;d with straiten&#39;d traces to the car,<br />
	Next, rushing to the Dardan spoil, detains<br />
	The heavenly coursers with the flowing manes:<br />
	These in proud triumph to the fleet convey&#39;d,<br />
	No longer now a Trojan lord obey&#39;d.<br />
	That charge to bold Deipylus he gave,<br />
	(Whom most he loved, as brave men love the brave,)<br />
	Then mounting on his car, resumed the rein,<br />
	And follow&#39;d where Tydides swept the plain.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile (his conquest ravished from his eyes)<br />
	The raging chief in chase of Venus flies:<br />
	No goddess she, commission&#39;d to the field,<br />
	Like Pallas dreadful with her sable shield,<br />
	Or fierce Bellona thundering at the wall,<br />
	While flames ascend, and mighty ruins fall;<br />
	He knew soft combats suit the tender dame,<br />
	New to the field, and still a foe to fame.<br />
	Through breaking ranks his furious course he bends,<br />
	And at the goddess his broad lance extends;<br />
	Through her bright veil the daring weapon drove,<br />
	The ambrosial veil which all the Graces wove;<br />
	Her snowy hand the razing steel profaned,<br />
	And the transparent skin with crimson stain&#39;d,<br />
	From the clear vein a stream immortal flow&#39;d,<br />
	Such stream as issues from a wounded god;<br />
	Pure emanation! uncorrupted flood!<br />
	Unlike our gross, diseased, terrestrial blood:<br />
	(For not the bread of man their life sustains,<br />
	Nor wine&#39;s inflaming juice supplies their veins:)<br />
	With tender shrieks the goddess fill&#39;d the place,<br />
	And dropp&#39;d her offspring from her weak embrace.<br />
	Him Phoebus took: he casts a cloud around<br />
	The fainting chief, and wards the mortal wound.</p>
<p>
	Then with a voice that shook the vaulted skies,<br />
	The king insults the goddess as she flies:<br />
	&quot;Ill with Jove&#39;s daughter bloody fights agree,<br />
	The field of combat is no scene for thee:<br />
	Go, let thy own soft sex employ thy care,<br />
	Go, lull the coward, or delude the fair.<br />
	Taught by this stroke renounce the war&#39;s alarms,<br />
	And learn to tremble at the name of arms.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Tydides thus. The goddess, seized with dread,<br />
	Confused, distracted, from the conflict fled.<br />
	To aid her, swift the winged Iris flew,<br />
	Wrapt in a mist above the warring crew.<br />
	The queen of love with faded charms she found.<br />
	Pale was her cheek, and livid look&#39;d the wound.<br />
	To Mars, who sat remote, they bent their way:<br />
	Far, on the left, with clouds involved he lay;<br />
	Beside him stood his lance, distain&#39;d with gore,<br />
	And, rein&#39;d with gold, his foaming steeds before.<br />
	Low at his knee, she begg&#39;d with streaming eyes<br />
	Her brother&#39;s car, to mount the distant skies,<br />
	And show&#39;d the wound by fierce Tydides given,<br />
	A mortal man, who dares encounter heaven.<br />
	Stern Mars attentive hears the queen complain,<br />
	And to her hand commits the golden rein;<br />
	She mounts the seat, oppress&#39;d with silent woe,<br />
	Driven by the goddess of the painted bow.<br />
	The lash resounds, the rapid chariot flies,<br />
	And in a moment scales the lofty skies:<br />
	They stopp&#39;d the car, and there the coursers stood,<br />
	Fed by fair Iris with ambrosial food;<br />
	Before her mother, love&#39;s bright queen appears,<br />
	O&#39;erwhelmed with anguish, and dissolved in tears:<br />
	She raised her in her arms, beheld her bleed,<br />
	And ask&#39;d what god had wrought this guilty deed?</p>
<p>
	Then she: &quot;This insult from no god I found,<br />
	An impious mortal gave the daring wound!<br />
	Behold the deed of haughty Diomed!<br />
	&#39;Twas in the son&#39;s defence the mother bled.<br />
	The war with Troy no more the Grecians wage;<br />
	But with the gods (the immortal gods) engage.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Dione then: &quot;Thy wrongs with patience bear,<br />
	And share those griefs inferior powers must share:<br />
	Unnumber&#39;d woes mankind from us sustain,<br />
	And men with woes afflict the gods again.<br />
	The mighty Mars in mortal fetters bound,<br />
	And lodged in brazen dungeons underground,<br />
	Full thirteen moons imprison&#39;d roar&#39;d in vain;<br />
	Otus and Ephialtes held the chain:<br />
	Perhaps had perish&#39;d had not Hermes&#39; care<br />
	Restored the groaning god to upper air.<br />
	Great Juno&#39;s self has borne her weight of pain,<br />
	The imperial partner of the heavenly reign;<br />
	Amphitryon&#39;s son infix&#39;d the deadly dart,<br />
	And fill&#39;d with anguish her immortal heart.<br />
	E&#39;en hell&#39;s grim king Alcides&#39; power confess&#39;d,<br />
	The shaft found entrance in his iron breast;<br />
	To Jove&#39;s high palace for a cure he fled,<br />
	Pierced in his own dominions of the dead;<br />
	Where Paeon, sprinkling heavenly balm around,<br />
	Assuaged the glowing pangs, and closed the wound.<br />
	Rash, impious man! to stain the bless&#39;d abodes,<br />
	And drench his arrows in the blood of gods!</p>
<p>
	&quot;But thou (though Pallas urged thy frantic deed),<br />
	Whose spear ill&ndash;fated makes a goddess bleed,<br />
	Know thou, whoe&#39;er with heavenly power contends,<br />
	Short is his date, and soon his glory ends;<br />
	From fields of death when late he shall retire,<br />
	No infant on his knees shall call him sire.<br />
	Strong as thou art, some god may yet be found,<br />
	To stretch thee pale and gasping on the ground;<br />
	Thy distant wife, &AElig;giale the fair,<br />
	Starting from sleep with a distracted air,<br />
	Shall rouse thy slaves, and her lost lord deplore,<br />
	The brave, the great, the glorious now no more!&quot;</p>
<p>
	This said, she wiped from Venus&#39; wounded palm<br />
	The sacred ichor, and infused the balm.<br />
	Juno and Pallas with a smile survey&#39;d,<br />
	And thus to Jove began the blue&ndash;eyed maid:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Permit thy daughter, gracious Jove! to tell<br />
	How this mischance the Cyprian queen befell,<br />
	As late she tried with passion to inflame<br />
	The tender bosom of a Grecian dame;<br />
	Allured the fair, with moving thoughts of joy,<br />
	To quit her country for some youth of Troy;<br />
	The clasping zone, with golden buckles bound,<br />
	Razed her soft hand with this lamented wound.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The sire of gods and men superior smiled,<br />
	And, calling Venus, thus address&#39;d his child:<br />
	&quot;Not these, O daughter are thy proper cares,<br />
	Thee milder arts befit, and softer wars;<br />
	Sweet smiles are thine, and kind endearing charms;<br />
	To Mars and Pallas leave the deeds of arms.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Thus they in heaven: while on the plain below<br />
	The fierce Tydides charged his Dardan foe,<br />
	Flush&#39;d with celestial blood pursued his way,<br />
	And fearless dared the threatening god of day;<br />
	Already in his hopes he saw him kill&#39;d,<br />
	Though screen&#39;d behind Apollo&#39;s mighty shield.<br />
	Thrice rushing furious, at the chief he strook;<br />
	His blazing buckler thrice Apollo shook:<br />
	He tried the fourth: when, breaking from the cloud,<br />
	A more than mortal voice was heard aloud.</p>
<p>
	&quot;O son of Tydeus, cease! be wise and see<br />
	How vast the difference of the gods and thee;<br />
	Distance immense! between the powers that shine<br />
	Above, eternal, deathless, and divine,<br />
	And mortal man! a wretch of humble birth,<br />
	A short&ndash;lived reptile in the dust of earth.&quot;</p>
<p>
	So spoke the god who darts celestial fires:<br />
	He dreads his fury, and some steps retires.<br />
	Then Phoebus bore the chief of Venus&#39; race<br />
	To Troy&#39;s high fane, and to his holy place;<br />
	Latona there and Phoebe heal&#39;d the wound,<br />
	With vigour arm&#39;d him, and with glory crown&#39;d.<br />
	This done, the patron of the silver bow<br />
	A phantom raised, the same in shape and show<br />
	With great &AElig;neas; such the form he bore,<br />
	And such in fight the radiant arms he wore.<br />
	Around the spectre bloody wars are waged,<br />
	And Greece and Troy with clashing shields engaged.<br />
	Meantime on Ilion&#39;s tower Apollo stood,<br />
	And calling Mars, thus urged the raging god:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Stern power of arms, by whom the mighty fall;<br />
	Who bathest in blood, and shakest the embattled wall,<br />
	Rise in thy wrath! to hell&#39;s abhorr&#39;d abodes<br />
	Despatch yon Greek, and vindicate the gods.<br />
	First rosy Venus felt his brutal rage;<br />
	Me next he charged, and dares all heaven engage:<br />
	The wretch would brave high heaven&#39;s immortal sire,<br />
	His triple thunder, and his bolts of fire.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The god of battle issues on the plain,<br />
	Stirs all the ranks, and fires the Trojan train;<br />
	In form like Acamas, the Thracian guide,<br />
	Enraged to Troy&#39;s retiring chiefs he cried:</p>
<p>
	&quot;How long, ye sons of Priam! will ye fly,<br />
	And unrevenged see Priam&#39;s people die?<br />
	Still unresisted shall the foe destroy,<br />
	And stretch the slaughter to the gates of Troy?<br />
	Lo, brave &AElig;neas sinks beneath his wound,<br />
	Not godlike Hector more in arms renown&#39;d:<br />
	Haste all, and take the generous warrior&#39;s part.<br />
	He said;&mdash;new courage swell&#39;d each hero&#39;s heart.<br />
	Sarpedon first his ardent soul express&#39;d,<br />
	And, turn&#39;d to Hector, these bold words address&#39;d:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Say, chief, is all thy ancient valour lost?<br />
	Where are thy threats, and where thy glorious boast,<br />
	That propp&#39;d alone by Priam&#39;s race should stand<br />
	Troy&#39;s sacred walls, nor need a foreign hand?<br />
	Now, now thy country calls her wonted friends,<br />
	And the proud vaunt in just derision ends.<br />
	Remote they stand while alien troops engage,<br />
	Like trembling hounds before the lion&#39;s rage.<br />
	Far distant hence I held my wide command,<br />
	Where foaming Xanthus laves the Lycian land;<br />
	With ample wealth (the wish of mortals) bless&#39;d,<br />
	A beauteous wife, and infant at her breast;<br />
	With those I left whatever dear could be:<br />
	Greece, if she conquers, nothing wins from me;<br />
	Yet first in fight my Lycian bands I cheer,<br />
	And long to meet this mighty man ye fear;<br />
	While Hector idle stands, nor bids the brave<br />
	Their wives, their infants, and their altars save.<br />
	Haste, warrior, haste! preserve thy threaten&#39;d state,<br />
	Or one vast burst of all&ndash;involving fate<br />
	Full o&#39;er your towers shall fall, and sweep away<br />
	Sons, sires, and wives, an undistinguish&#39;d prey.<br />
	Rouse all thy Trojans, urge thy aids to fight;<br />
	These claim thy thoughts by day, thy watch by night;<br />
	With force incessant the brave Greeks oppose;<br />
	Such cares thy friends deserve, and such thy foes.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Stung to the heart the generous Hector hears,<br />
	But just reproof with decent silence bears.<br />
	From his proud car the prince impetuous springs,<br />
	On earth he leaps, his brazen armour rings.<br />
	Two shining spears are brandish&#39;d in his hands;<br />
	Thus arm&#39;d, he animates his drooping bands,<br />
	Revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,<br />
	And wakes anew the dying flames of fight.<br />
	They turn, they stand; the Greeks their fury dare,<br />
	Condense their powers, and wait the growing war.</p>
<p>
	As when, on Ceres&#39; sacred floor, the swain<br />
	Spreads the wide fan to clear the golden grain,<br />
	And the light chaff, before the breezes borne,<br />
	Ascends in clouds from off the heapy corn;<br />
	The grey dust, rising with collected winds,<br />
	Drives o&#39;er the barn, and whitens all the hinds:<br />
	So white with dust the Grecian host appears.<br />
	From trampling steeds, and thundering charioteers;<br />
	The dusky clouds from labour&#39;d earth arise,<br />
	And roll in smoking volumes to the skies.<br />
	Mars hovers o&#39;er them with his sable shield,<br />
	And adds new horrors to the darken&#39;d field:<br />
	Pleased with his charge, and ardent to fulfil,<br />
	In Troy&#39;s defence, Apollo&#39;s heavenly will:<br />
	Soon as from fight the blue&ndash;eyed maid retires,<br />
	Each Trojan bosom with new warmth he fires.<br />
	And now the god, from forth his sacred fane,<br />
	Produced &AElig;neas to the shouting train;<br />
	Alive, unharm&#39;d, with all his peers around,<br />
	Erect he stood, and vigorous from his wound:<br />
	Inquiries none they made; the dreadful day<br />
	No pause of words admits, no dull delay;<br />
	Fierce Discord storms, Apollo loud exclaims,<br />
	Fame calls, Mars thunders, and the field&#39;s in flames.</p>
<p>
	Stern Diomed with either Ajax stood,<br />
	And great Ulysses, bathed in hostile blood.<br />
	Embodied close, the labouring Grecian train<br />
	The fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain.<br />
	Unmoved and silent, the whole war they wait<br />
	Serenely dreadful, and as fix&#39;d as fate.<br />
	So when the embattled clouds in dark array,<br />
	Along the skies their gloomy lines display;<br />
	When now the North his boisterous rage has spent,<br />
	And peaceful sleeps the liquid element:<br />
	The low&ndash;hung vapours, motionless and still,<br />
	Rest on the summits of the shaded hill;<br />
	Till the mass scatters as the winds arise,<br />
	Dispersed and broken through the ruffled skies.</p>
<p>
	Nor was the general wanting to his train;<br />
	From troop to troop he toils through all the plain,<br />
	&quot;Ye Greeks, be men! the charge of battle bear;<br />
	Your brave associates and yourselves revere!<br />
	Let glorious acts more glorious acts inspire,<br />
	And catch from breast to breast the noble fire!<br />
	On valour&#39;s side the odds of combat lie,<br />
	The brave live glorious, or lamented die;<br />
	The wretch who trembles in the field of fame,<br />
	Meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame!&quot;</p>
<p>
	These words he seconds with his flying lance,<br />
	To meet whose point was strong Deicoon&#39;s chance:<br />
	&AElig;neas&#39; friend, and in his native place<br />
	Honour&#39;d and loved like Priam&#39;s royal race:<br />
	Long had he fought the foremost in the field,<br />
	But now the monarch&#39;s lance transpierced his shield:<br />
	His shield too weak the furious dart to stay,<br />
	Through his broad belt the weapon forced its way:<br />
	The grisly wound dismiss&#39;d his soul to hell,<br />
	His arms around him rattled as he fell.</p>
<p>
	Then fierce &AElig;neas, brandishing his blade,<br />
	In dust Orsilochus and Crethon laid,<br />
	Whose sire Diocleus, wealthy, brave and great,<br />
	In well&ndash;built Pherae held his lofty seat:<br />
	Sprung from Alpheus&#39; plenteous stream, that yields<br />
	Increase of harvests to the Pylian fields.<br />
	He got Orsilochus, Diocleus he,<br />
	And these descended in the third degree.<br />
	Too early expert in the martial toil,<br />
	In sable ships they left their native soil,<br />
	To avenge Atrides: now, untimely slain,<br />
	They fell with glory on the Phrygian plain.<br />
	So two young mountain lions, nursed with blood<br />
	In deep recesses of the gloomy wood,<br />
	Rush fearless to the plains, and uncontroll&#39;d<br />
	Depopulate the stalls and waste the fold:<br />
	Till pierced at distance from their native den,<br />
	O&#39;erpowered they fall beneath the force of men.<br />
	Prostrate on earth their beauteous bodies lay,<br />
	Like mountain firs, as tall and straight as they.<br />
	Great Menelaus views with pitying eyes,<br />
	Lifts his bright lance, and at the victor flies;<br />
	Mars urged him on; yet, ruthless in his hate,<br />
	The god but urged him to provoke his fate.<br />
	He thus advancing, Nestor&#39;s valiant son<br />
	Shakes for his danger, and neglects his own;<br />
	Struck with the thought, should Helen&#39;s lord be slain,<br />
	And all his country&#39;s glorious labours vain.<br />
	Already met, the threatening heroes stand;<br />
	The spears already tremble in their hand:<br />
	In rush&#39;d Antilochus, his aid to bring,<br />
	And fall or conquer by the Spartan king.<br />
	These seen, the Dardan backward turn&#39;d his course,<br />
	Brave as he was, and shunn&#39;d unequal force.<br />
	The breathless bodies to the Greeks they drew,<br />
	Then mix in combat, and their toils renew.</p>
<p>
	First, Pylaemenes, great in battle, bled,<br />
	Who sheathed in brass the Paphlagonians led.<br />
	Atrides mark&#39;d him where sublime he stood;<br />
	Fix&#39;d in his throat the javelin drank his blood.<br />
	The faithful Mydon, as he turn&#39;d from fight<br />
	His flying coursers, sunk to endless night;<br />
	A broken rock by Nestor&#39;s son was thrown:<br />
	His bended arm received the falling stone;<br />
	From his numb&#39;d hand the ivory&ndash;studded reins,<br />
	Dropp&#39;d in the dust, are trail&#39;d along the plains:<br />
	Meanwhile his temples feel a deadly wound;<br />
	He groans in death, and ponderous sinks to ground:<br />
	Deep drove his helmet in the sands, and there<br />
	The head stood fix&#39;d, the quivering legs in air,<br />
	Till trampled flat beneath the coursers&#39; feet:<br />
	The youthful victor mounts his empty seat,<br />
	And bears the prize in triumph to the fleet.</p>
<p>
	Great Hector saw, and, raging at the view,<br />
	Pours on the Greeks: the Trojan troops pursue:<br />
	He fires his host with animating cries,<br />
	And brings along the furies of the skies,<br />
	Mars, stern destroyer! and Bellona dread,<br />
	Flame in the front, and thunder at their head:<br />
	This swells the tumult and the rage of fight;<br />
	That shakes a spear that casts a dreadful light.<br />
	Where Hector march&#39;d, the god of battles shined,<br />
	Now storm&#39;d before him, and now raged behind.</p>
<p>
	Tydides paused amidst his full career;<br />
	Then first the hero&#39;s manly breast knew fear.<br />
	As when some simple swain his cot forsakes,<br />
	And wide through fens an unknown journey takes:<br />
	If chance a swelling brook his passage stay,<br />
	And foam impervious &#39;cross the wanderer&#39;s way,<br />
	Confused he stops, a length of country pass&#39;d,<br />
	Eyes the rough waves, and tired, returns at last.<br />
	Amazed no less the great Tydides stands:<br />
	He stay&#39;d, and turning thus address&#39;d his bands:</p>
<p>
	&quot;No wonder, Greeks! that all to Hector yield;<br />
	Secure of favouring gods, he takes the field;<br />
	His strokes they second, and avert our spears.<br />
	Behold where Mars in mortal arms appears!<br />
	Retire then, warriors, but sedate and slow;<br />
	Retire, but with your faces to the foe.<br />
	Trust not too much your unavailing might;<br />
	&#39;Tis not with Troy, but with the gods ye fight.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Now near the Greeks the black battalions drew;<br />
	And first two leaders valiant Hector slew:<br />
	His force Anchialus and Mnesthes found,<br />
	In every art of glorious war renown&#39;d;<br />
	In the same car the chiefs to combat ride,<br />
	And fought united, and united died.<br />
	Struck at the sight, the mighty Ajax glows<br />
	With thirst of vengeance, and assaults the foes.<br />
	His massy spear with matchless fury sent,<br />
	Through Amphius&#39; belt and heaving belly went;<br />
	Amphius Apaesus&#39; happy soil possess&#39;d,<br />
	With herds abounding, and with treasure bless&#39;d;<br />
	But fate resistless from his country led<br />
	The chief, to perish at his people&#39;s head.<br />
	Shook with his fall his brazen armour rung,<br />
	And fierce, to seize it, conquering Ajax sprung;<br />
	Around his head an iron tempest rain&#39;d;<br />
	A wood of spears his ample shield sustain&#39;d:<br />
	Beneath one foot the yet warm corpse he press&#39;d,<br />
	And drew his javelin from the bleeding breast:<br />
	He could no more; the showering darts denied<br />
	To spoil his glittering arms, and plumy pride.<br />
	Now foes on foes came pouring on the fields,<br />
	With bristling lances, and compacted shields;<br />
	Till in the steely circle straiten&#39;d round,<br />
	Forced he gives way, and sternly quits the ground.</p>
<p>
	While thus they strive, Tlepolemus the great,<br />
	Urged by the force of unresisted fate,<br />
	Burns with desire Sarpedon&#39;s strength to prove;<br />
	Alcides&#39; offspring meets the son of Jove.<br />
	Sheathed in bright arms each adverse chief came on.<br />
	Jove&#39;s great descendant, and his greater son.<br />
	Prepared for combat, ere the lance he toss&#39;d,<br />
	The daring Rhodian vents his haughty boast:</p>
<p>
	&quot;What brings this Lycian counsellor so far,<br />
	To tremble at our arms, not mix in war!<br />
	Know thy vain self, nor let their flattery move,<br />
	Who style thee son of cloud&ndash;compelling Jove.<br />
	How far unlike those chiefs of race divine,<br />
	How vast the difference of their deeds and thine!<br />
	Jove got such heroes as my sire, whose soul<br />
	No fear could daunt, nor earth nor hell control.<br />
	Troy felt his arm, and yon proud ramparts stand<br />
	Raised on the ruins of his vengeful hand:<br />
	With six small ships, and but a slender train,<br />
	lie left the town a wide&ndash;deserted plain.<br />
	But what art thou, who deedless look&#39;st around,<br />
	While unrevenged thy Lycians bite the ground!<br />
	Small aid to Troy thy feeble force can be;<br />
	But wert thou greater, thou must yield to me.<br />
	Pierced by my spear, to endless darkness go!<br />
	I make this present to the shades below.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The son of Hercules, the Rhodian guide,<br />
	Thus haughty spoke. The Lycian king replied:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Thy sire, O prince! o&#39;erturn&#39;d the Trojan state,<br />
	Whose perjured monarch well deserved his fate;<br />
	Those heavenly steeds the hero sought so far,<br />
	False he detain&#39;d, the just reward of war.<br />
	Nor so content, the generous chief defied,<br />
	With base reproaches and unmanly pride.<br />
	But you, unworthy the high race you boast,<br />
	Shall raise my glory when thy own is lost:<br />
	Now meet thy fate, and by Sarpedon slain,<br />
	Add one more ghost to Pluto&#39;s gloomy reign.&quot;</p>
<p>
	He said: both javelins at an instant flew;<br />
	Both struck, both wounded, but Sarpedon&#39;s slew:<br />
	Full in the boaster&#39;s neck the weapon stood,<br />
	Transfix&#39;d his throat, and drank the vital blood;<br />
	The soul disdainful seeks the caves of night,<br />
	And his seal&#39;d eyes for ever lose the light.</p>
<p>
	Yet not in vain, Tlepolemus, was thrown<br />
	Thy angry lance; which piercing to the bone<br />
	Sarpedon&#39;s thigh, had robb&#39;d the chief of breath;<br />
	But Jove was present, and forbade the death.<br />
	Borne from the conflict by his Lycian throng,<br />
	The wounded hero dragg&#39;d the lance along.<br />
	(His friends, each busied in his several part,<br />
	Through haste, or danger, had not drawn the dart.)<br />
	The Greeks with slain Tlepolemus retired;<br />
	Whose fall Ulysses view&#39;d, with fury fired;<br />
	Doubtful if Jove&#39;s great son he should pursue,<br />
	Or pour his vengeance on the Lycian crew.<br />
	But heaven and fate the first design withstand,<br />
	Nor this great death must grace Ulysses&#39; hand.<br />
	Minerva drives him on the Lycian train;<br />
	Alastor, Cronius, Halius, strew&#39;d the plain,<br />
	Alcander, Prytanis, Noemon fell:<br />
	And numbers more his sword had sent to hell,<br />
	But Hector saw; and, furious at the sight,<br />
	Rush&#39;d terrible amidst the ranks of fight.<br />
	With joy Sarpedon view&#39;d the wish&#39;d relief,<br />
	And, faint, lamenting, thus implored the chief:</p>
<p>
	&quot;O suffer not the foe to bear away<br />
	My helpless corpse, an unassisted prey;<br />
	If I, unbless&#39;d, must see my son no more,<br />
	My much&ndash;loved consort, and my native shore,<br />
	Yet let me die in Ilion&#39;s sacred wall;<br />
	Troy, in whose cause I fell, shall mourn my fall.&quot;</p>
<p>
	He said, nor Hector to the chief replies,<br />
	But shakes his plume, and fierce to combat flies;<br />
	Swift as a whirlwind, drives the scattering foes;<br />
	And dyes the ground with purple as he goes.</p>
<p>
	Beneath a beech, Jove&#39;s consecrated shade,<br />
	His mournful friends divine Sarpedon laid:<br />
	Brave Pelagon, his favourite chief, was nigh,<br />
	Who wrench&#39;d the javelin from his sinewy thigh.<br />
	The fainting soul stood ready wing&#39;d for flight,<br />
	And o&#39;er his eye&ndash;balls swam the shades of night;<br />
	But Boreas rising fresh, with gentle breath,<br />
	Recall&#39;d his spirit from the gates of death.</p>
<p>
	The generous Greeks recede with tardy pace,<br />
	Though Mars and Hector thunder in their face;<br />
	None turn their backs to mean ignoble flight,<br />
	Slow they retreat, and even retreating fight.<br />
	Who first, who last, by Mars&#39; and Hector&#39;s hand,<br />
	Stretch&#39;d in their blood, lay gasping on the sand?<br />
	Tenthras the great, Orestes the renown&#39;d<br />
	For managed steeds, and Trechus press&#39;d the ground;,<br />
	Next OEnomaus and OEnops&#39; offspring died;<br />
	Oresbius last fell groaning at their side:<br />
	Oresbius, in his painted mitre gay,<br />
	In fat Boeotia held his wealthy sway,<br />
	Where lakes surround low Hyle&#39;s watery plain;<br />
	A prince and people studious of their gain.</p>
<p>
	The carnage Juno from the skies survey&#39;d,<br />
	And touch&#39;d with grief bespoke the blue&ndash;eyed maid:<br />
	&quot;Oh, sight accursed! Shall faithless Troy prevail,<br />
	And shall our promise to our people fail?<br />
	How vain the word to Menelaus given<br />
	By Jove&#39;s great daughter and the queen of heaven,<br />
	Beneath his arms that Priam&#39;s towers should fall,<br />
	If warring gods for ever guard the wall!<br />
	Mars, red with slaughter, aids our hated foes:<br />
	Haste, let us arm, and force with force oppose!&quot;</p>
<p>
	She spoke; Minerva burns to meet the war:<br />
	And now heaven&#39;s empress calls her blazing car.<br />
	At her command rush forth the steeds divine;<br />
	Rich with immortal gold their trappings shine.<br />
	Bright Hebe waits; by Hebe, ever young,<br />
	The whirling wheels are to the chariot hung.<br />
	On the bright axle turns the bidden wheel<br />
	Of sounding brass; the polished axle steel.<br />
	Eight brazen spokes in radiant order flame;<br />
	The circles gold, of uncorrupted frame,<br />
	Such as the heavens produce: and round the gold<br />
	Two brazen rings of work divine were roll&#39;d.<br />
	The bossy naves of sold silver shone;<br />
	Braces of gold suspend the moving throne:<br />
	The car, behind, an arching figure bore;<br />
	The bending concave form&#39;d an arch before.<br />
	Silver the beam, the extended yoke was gold,<br />
	And golden reins the immortal coursers hold.<br />
	Herself, impatient, to the ready car,<br />
	The coursers joins, and breathes revenge and war.</p>
<p>
	Pallas disrobes; her radiant veil untied,<br />
	With flowers adorn&#39;d, with art diversified,<br />
	(The laboured veil her heavenly fingers wove,)<br />
	Flows on the pavement of the court of Jove.<br />
	Now heaven&#39;s dread arms her mighty limbs invest,<br />
	Jove&#39;s cuirass blazes on her ample breast;<br />
	Deck&#39;d in sad triumph for the mournful field,<br />
	O&#39;er her broad shoulders hangs his horrid shield,<br />
	Dire, black, tremendous! Round the margin roll&#39;d,<br />
	A fringe of serpents hissing guards the gold:<br />
	Here all the terrors of grim War appear,<br />
	Here rages Force, here tremble Flight and Fear,<br />
	Here storm&#39;d Contention, and here Fury frown&#39;d,<br />
	And the dire orb portentous Gorgon crown&#39;d.<br />
	The massy golden helm she next assumes,<br />
	That dreadful nods with four o&#39;ershading plumes;<br />
	So vast, the broad circumference contains<br />
	A hundred armies on a hundred plains.<br />
	The goddess thus the imperial car ascends;<br />
	Shook by her arm the mighty javelin bends,<br />
	Ponderous and huge; that when her fury burns,<br />
	Proud tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o&#39;erturns.</p>
<p>
	Swift at the scourge the ethereal coursers fly,<br />
	While the smooth chariot cuts the liquid sky.<br />
	Heaven&#39;s gates spontaneous open to the powers,<br />
	Heaven&#39;s golden gates, kept by the winged Hours;<br />
	Commission&#39;d in alternate watch they stand,<br />
	The sun&#39;s bright portals and the skies command,<br />
	Involve in clouds the eternal gates of day,<br />
	Or the dark barrier roll with ease away.<br />
	The sounding hinges ring on either side<br />
	The gloomy volumes, pierced with light, divide.<br />
	The chariot mounts, where deep in ambient skies,<br />
	Confused, Olympus&#39; hundred heads arise;<br />
	Where far apart the Thunderer fills his throne,<br />
	O&#39;er all the gods superior and alone.<br />
	There with her snowy hand the queen restrains<br />
	The fiery steeds, and thus to Jove complains:</p>
<p>
	&quot;O sire! can no resentment touch thy soul?<br />
	Can Mars rebel, and does no thunder roll?<br />
	What lawless rage on yon forbidden plain,<br />
	What rash destruction! and what heroes slain!<br />
	Venus, and Phoebus with the dreadful bow,<br />
	Smile on the slaughter, and enjoy my woe.<br />
	Mad, furious power! whose unrelenting mind<br />
	No god can govern, and no justice bind.<br />
	Say, mighty father! shall we scourge this pride,<br />
	And drive from fight the impetuous homicide?&quot;</p>
<p>
	To whom assenting, thus the Thunderer said:<br />
	&quot;Go! and the great Minerva be thy aid.<br />
	To tame the monster&ndash;god Minerva knows,<br />
	And oft afflicts his brutal breast with woes.&quot;</p>
<p>
	He said; Saturnia, ardent to obey,<br />
	Lash&#39;d her white steeds along the &AElig;rial way<br />
	Swift down the steep of heaven the chariot rolls,<br />
	Between the expanded earth and starry poles<br />
	Far as a shepherd, from some point on high,<br />
	O&#39;er the wide main extends his boundless eye,<br />
	Through such a space of air, with thundering sound,<br />
	At every leap the immortal coursers bound<br />
	Troy now they reach&#39;d and touch&#39;d those banks divine,<br />
	Where silver Simois and Scamander join<br />
	There Juno stopp&#39;d, and (her fair steeds unloosed)<br />
	Of air condensed a vapour circumfused<br />
	For these, impregnate with celestial dew,<br />
	On Simois, brink ambrosial herbage grew.<br />
	Thence to relieve the fainting Argive throng,<br />
	Smooth as the sailing doves they glide along.</p>
<p>
	The best and bravest of the Grecian band<br />
	(A warlike circle) round Tydides stand.<br />
	Such was their look as lions bathed in blood,<br />
	Or foaming boars, the terror of the wood<br />
	Heaven&#39;s empress mingles with the mortal crowd,<br />
	And shouts, in Stentor&#39;s sounding voice, aloud;<br />
	Stentor the strong, endued with brazen lungs,<br />
	Whose throats surpass&#39;d the force of fifty tongues.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Inglorious Argives! to your race a shame,<br />
	And only men in figure and in name!<br />
	Once from the walls your timorous foes engaged,<br />
	While fierce in war divine Achilles raged;<br />
	Now issuing fearless they possess the plain,<br />
	Now win the shores, and scarce the seas remain.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Her speech new fury to their hearts convey&#39;d;<br />
	While near Tydides stood the Athenian maid;<br />
	The king beside his panting steeds she found,<br />
	O&#39;erspent with toil reposing on the ground;<br />
	To cool his glowing wound he sat apart,<br />
	(The wound inflicted by the Lycian dart.)<br />
	Large drops of sweat from all his limbs descend,<br />
	Beneath his ponderous shield his sinews bend,<br />
	Whose ample belt, that o&#39;er his shoulder lay,<br />
	He eased; and wash&#39;d the clotted gore away.<br />
	The goddess leaning o&#39;er the bending yoke,<br />
	Beside his coursers, thus her silence broke:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Degenerate prince! and not of Tydeus&#39; kind,<br />
	Whose little body lodged a mighty mind;<br />
	Foremost he press&#39;d in glorious toils to share,<br />
	And scarce refrain&#39;d when I forbade the war.<br />
	Alone, unguarded, once he dared to go,<br />
	And feast, incircled by the Theban foe;<br />
	There braved, and vanquish&#39;d, many a hardy knight;<br />
	Such nerves I gave him, and such force in fight.<br />
	Thou too no less hast been my constant care;<br />
	Thy hands I arm&#39;d, and sent thee forth to war:<br />
	But thee or fear deters, or sloth detains;<br />
	No drop of all thy father warms thy veins.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The chief thus answered mild: &quot;Immortal maid!<br />
	I own thy presence, and confess thy aid.<br />
	Not fear, thou know&#39;st, withholds me from the plains,<br />
	Nor sloth hath seized me, but thy word restrains:<br />
	From warring gods thou bad&#39;st me turn my spear,<br />
	And Venus only found resistance here.<br />
	Hence, goddess! heedful of thy high commands,<br />
	Loth I gave way, and warn&#39;d our Argive bands:<br />
	For Mars, the homicide, these eyes beheld,<br />
	With slaughter red, and raging round the field.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Then thus Minerva:&mdash;&quot;Brave Tydides, hear!<br />
	Not Mars himself, nor aught immortal, fear.<br />
	Full on the god impel thy foaming horse:<br />
	Pallas commands, and Pallas lends thee force.<br />
	Rash, furious, blind, from these to those he flies,<br />
	And every side of wavering combat tries;<br />
	Large promise makes, and breaks the promise made:<br />
	Now gives the Grecians, now the Trojans aid.&quot;</p>
<p>
	She said, and to the steeds approaching near,<br />
	Drew from his seat the martial charioteer.<br />
	The vigorous power the trembling car ascends,<br />
	Fierce for revenge; and Diomed attends:<br />
	The groaning axle bent beneath the load;<br />
	So great a hero, and so great a god.<br />
	She snatch&#39;d the reins, she lash&#39;d with all her force,<br />
	And full on Mars impelled the foaming horse:<br />
	But first, to hide her heavenly visage, spread<br />
	Black Orcus&#39; helmet o&#39;er her radiant head.</p>
<p>
	Just then gigantic Periphas lay slain,<br />
	The strongest warrior of the &AElig;tolian train;<br />
	The god, who slew him, leaves his prostrate prize<br />
	Stretch&#39;d where he fell, and at Tydides flies.<br />
	Now rushing fierce, in equal arms appear<br />
	The daring Greek, the dreadful god of war!<br />
	Full at the chief, above his courser&#39;s head,<br />
	From Mars&#39;s arm the enormous weapon fled:<br />
	Pallas opposed her hand, and caused to glance<br />
	Far from the car the strong immortal lance.<br />
	Then threw the force of Tydeus&#39; warlike son;<br />
	The javelin hiss&#39;d; the goddess urged it on:<br />
	Where the broad cincture girt his armour round,<br />
	It pierced the god: his groin received the wound.<br />
	From the rent skin the warrior tugs again<br />
	The smoking steel. Mars bellows with the pain:<br />
	Loud as the roar encountering armies yield,<br />
	When shouting millions shake the thundering field.<br />
	Both armies start, and trembling gaze around;<br />
	And earth and heaven re&ndash;bellow to the sound.<br />
	As vapours blown by Auster&#39;s sultry breath,<br />
	Pregnant with plagues, and shedding seeds of death,<br />
	Beneath the rage of burning Sirius rise,<br />
	Choke the parch&#39;d earth, and blacken all the skies;<br />
	In such a cloud the god from combat driven,<br />
	High o&#39;er the dusky whirlwind scales the heaven.<br />
	Wild with his pain, he sought the bright abodes,<br />
	There sullen sat beneath the sire of gods,<br />
	Show&#39;d the celestial blood, and with a groan<br />
	Thus pour&#39;d his plaints before the immortal throne:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Can Jove, supine, flagitious facts survey,<br />
	And brook the furies of this daring day?<br />
	For mortal men celestial powers engage,<br />
	And gods on gods exert eternal rage:<br />
	From thee, O father! all these ills we bear,<br />
	And thy fell daughter with the shield and spear;<br />
	Thou gavest that fury to the realms of light,<br />
	Pernicious, wild, regardless of the right.<br />
	All heaven beside reveres thy sovereign sway,<br />
	Thy voice we hear, and thy behests obey:<br />
	&#39;Tis hers to offend, and even offending share<br />
	Thy breast, thy counsels, thy distinguish&#39;d care:<br />
	So boundless she, and thou so partial grown,<br />
	Well may we deem the wondrous birth thy own.<br />
	Now frantic Diomed, at her command,<br />
	Against the immortals lifts his raging hand:<br />
	The heavenly Venus first his fury found,<br />
	Me next encountering, me he dared to wound;<br />
	Vanquish&#39;d I fled; even I, the god of fight,<br />
	From mortal madness scarce was saved by flight.<br />
	Else hadst thou seen me sink on yonder plain,<br />
	Heap&#39;d round, and heaving under loads of slain!<br />
	Or pierced with Grecian darts, for ages lie,<br />
	Condemn&#39;d to pain, though fated not to die.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Him thus upbraiding, with a wrathful look<br />
	The lord of thunders view&#39;d, and stern bespoke:<br />
	&quot;To me, perfidious! this lamenting strain?<br />
	Of lawless force shall lawless Mars complain?<br />
	Of all the gods who tread the spangled skies,<br />
	Thou most unjust, most odious in our eyes!<br />
	Inhuman discord is thy dire delight,<br />
	The waste of slaughter, and the rage of fight.<br />
	No bounds, no law, thy fiery temper quells,<br />
	And all thy mother in thy soul rebels.<br />
	In vain our threats, in vain our power we use;<br />
	She gives the example, and her son pursues.<br />
	Yet long the inflicted pangs thou shall not mourn,<br />
	Sprung since thou art from Jove, and heavenly&ndash;born.<br />
	Else, singed with lightning, hadst thou hence been thrown,<br />
	Where chain&#39;d on burning rocks the Titans groan.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Thus he who shakes Olympus with his nod;<br />
	Then gave to Paeon&#39;s care the bleeding god.<br />
	With gentle hand the balm he pour&#39;d around,<br />
	And heal&#39;d the immortal flesh, and closed the wound.<br />
	As when the fig&#39;s press&#39;d juice, infused in cream,<br />
	To curds coagulates the liquid stream,<br />
	Sudden the fluids fix the parts combined;<br />
	Such, and so soon, the ethereal texture join&#39;d.<br />
	Cleansed from the dust and gore, fair Hebe dress&#39;d<br />
	His mighty limbs in an immortal vest.<br />
	Glorious he sat, in majesty restored,<br />
	Fast by the throne of heaven&#39;s superior lord.<br />
	Juno and Pallas mount the bless&#39;d abodes,<br />
	Their task perform&#39;d, and mix among the gods.</p>
