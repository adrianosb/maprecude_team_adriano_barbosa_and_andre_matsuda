	The Greeks having retired into their intrenchments, Hector attempts to force them; but it proving impossible to pass the ditch, Polydamas advises to quit their chariots, and manage the attack on foot. The Trojans follow his counsel; and having divided their army into five bodies of foot, begin the assault. But upon the signal of an eagle with a serpent in his talons, which appeared on the left hand of the Trojans, Polydamas endeavours to withdraw them again. This Hector opposes, and continues the attack; in which, after many actions, Sarpedon makes the first breach in the wall. Hector also, casting a stone of vast size, forces open one of the gates, and enters at the head of his troops, who victoriously pursue the Grecians even to their ships.</p>
<p>
	While thus the hero&#39;s pious cares attend<br />
	The cure and safety of his wounded friend,<br />
	Trojans and Greeks with clashing shields engage,<br />
	And mutual deaths are dealt with mutual rage.<br />
	Nor long the trench or lofty walls oppose;<br />
	With gods averse the ill&ndash;fated works arose;<br />
	Their powers neglected, and no victim slain,<br />
	The walls were raised, the trenches sunk in vain.</p>
<p>
	Without the gods, how short a period stands<br />
	The proudest monument of mortal hands!<br />
	This stood while Hector and Achilles raged.<br />
	While sacred Troy the warring hosts engaged;<br />
	But when her sons were slain, her city burn&#39;d,<br />
	And what survived of Greece to Greece return&#39;d;<br />
	Then Neptune and Apollo shook the shore,<br />
	Then Ida&#39;s summits pour&#39;d their watery store;<br />
	Rhesus and Rhodius then unite their rills,<br />
	Caresus roaring down the stony hills,<br />
	&AElig;sepus, Granicus, with mingled force,<br />
	And Xanthus foaming from his fruitful source;<br />
	And gulfy Simois, rolling to the main<br />
	Helmets, and shields, and godlike heroes slain:<br />
	These, turn&#39;d by Phoebus from their wonted ways,<br />
	Deluged the rampire nine continual days;<br />
	The weight of waters saps the yielding wall,<br />
	And to the sea the floating bulwarks fall.<br />
	Incessant cataracts the Thunderer pours,<br />
	And half the skies descend in sluicy showers.<br />
	The god of ocean, marching stern before,<br />
	With his huge trident wounds the trembling shore,<br />
	Vast stones and piles from their foundation heaves,<br />
	And whelms the smoky ruin in the waves.<br />
	Now smooth&#39;d with sand, and levell&#39;d by the flood,<br />
	No fragment tells where once the wonder stood;<br />
	In their old bounds the rivers roll again,<br />
	Shine &#39;twixt the hills, or wander o&#39;er the plain.</p>
<p>
	But this the gods in later times perform;<br />
	As yet the bulwark stood, and braved the storm;<br />
	The strokes yet echoed of contending powers;<br />
	War thunder&#39;d at the gates, and blood distain&#39;d the towers.<br />
	Smote by the arm of Jove with dire dismay,<br />
	Close by their hollow ships the Grecians lay:<br />
	Hector&#39;s approach in every wind they hear,<br />
	And Hector&#39;s fury every moment fear.<br />
	He, like a whirlwind, toss&#39;d the scattering throng,<br />
	Mingled the troops, and drove the field along.<br />
	So &#39;midst the dogs and hunters&#39; daring bands,<br />
	Fierce of his might, a boar or lion stands;<br />
	Arm&#39;d foes around a dreadful circle form,<br />
	And hissing javelins rain an iron storm:<br />
	His powers untamed, their bold assault defy,<br />
	And where he turns the rout disperse or die:<br />
	He foams, he glares, he bounds against them all,<br />
	And if he falls, his courage makes him fall.<br />
	With equal rage encompass&#39;d Hector glows;<br />
	Exhorts his armies, and the trenches shows.<br />
	The panting steeds impatient fury breathe,<br />
	And snort and tremble at the gulf beneath;<br />
	Just at the brink they neigh, and paw the ground,<br />
	And the turf trembles, and the skies resound.<br />
	Eager they view&#39;d the prospect dark and deep,<br />
	Vast was the leap, and headlong hung the steep;<br />
	The bottom bare, (a formidable show!)<br />
	And bristled thick with sharpen&#39;d stakes below.<br />
	The foot alone this strong defence could force,<br />
	And try the pass impervious to the horse.<br />
	This saw Polydamas; who, wisely brave,<br />
	Restrain&#39;d great Hector, and this counsel gave:</p>
<p>
	&quot;O thou, bold leader of the Trojan bands!<br />
	And you, confederate chiefs from foreign lands!<br />
	What entrance here can cumbrous chariots find,<br />
	The stakes beneath, the Grecian walls behind?<br />
	No pass through those, without a thousand wounds,<br />
	No space for combat in yon narrow bounds.<br />
	Proud of the favours mighty Jove has shown,<br />
	On certain dangers we too rashly run:<br />
	If &#39;tis will our haughty foes to tame,<br />
	Oh may this instant end the Grecian name!<br />
	Here, far from Argos, let their heroes fall,<br />
	And one great day destroy and bury all!<br />
	But should they turn, and here oppress our train,<br />
	What hopes, what methods of retreat remain?<br />
	Wedged in the trench, by our own troops confused,<br />
	In one promiscuous carnage crush&#39;d and bruised,<br />
	All Troy must perish, if their arms prevail,<br />
	Nor shall a Trojan live to tell the tale.<br />
	Hear then, ye warriors! and obey with speed;<br />
	Back from the trenches let your steeds be led;<br />
	Then all alighting, wedged in firm array,<br />
	Proceed on foot, and Hector lead the way.<br />
	So Greece shall stoop before our conquering power,<br />
	And this (if Jove consent) her fatal hour.&quot;</p>
<p>
	This counsel pleased: the godlike Hector sprung<br />
	Swift from his seat; his clanging armour rung.<br />
	The chief&#39;s example follow&#39;d by his train,<br />
	Each quits his car, and issues on the plain,<br />
	By orders strict the charioteers enjoin&#39;d<br />
	Compel the coursers to their ranks behind.<br />
	The forces part in five distinguish&#39;d bands,<br />
	And all obey their several chiefs&#39; commands.<br />
	The best and bravest in the first conspire,<br />
	Pant for the fight, and threat the fleet with fire:<br />
	Great Hector glorious in the van of these,<br />
	Polydamas, and brave Cebriones.<br />
	Before the next the graceful Paris shines,<br />
	And bold Alcathous, and Agenor joins.<br />
	The sons of Priam with the third appear,<br />
	Deiphobus, and Helenas the seer;<br />
	In arms with these the mighty Asius stood,<br />
	Who drew from Hyrtacus his noble blood,<br />
	And whom Arisba&#39;s yellow coursers bore,<br />
	The coursers fed on Selle&#39;s winding shore.<br />
	Antenor&#39;s sons the fourth battalion guide,<br />
	And great &AElig;neas, born on fountful Ide.<br />
	Divine Sarpedon the last band obey&#39;d,<br />
	Whom Glaucus and Asteropaeus aid.<br />
	Next him, the bravest, at their army&#39;s head,<br />
	But he more brave than all the hosts he led.</p>
<p>
	Now with compacted shields in close array,<br />
	The moving legions speed their headlong way:<br />
	Already in their hopes they fire the fleet,<br />
	And see the Grecians gasping at their feet.</p>
<p>
	While every Trojan thus, and every aid,<br />
	The advice of wise Polydamas obey&#39;d,<br />
	Asius alone, confiding in his car,<br />
	His vaunted coursers urged to meet the war.<br />
	Unhappy hero! and advised in vain;<br />
	Those wheels returning ne&#39;er shall mark the plain;<br />
	No more those coursers with triumphant joy<br />
	Restore their master to the gates of Troy!<br />
	Black death attends behind the Grecian wall,<br />
	And great Idomeneus shall boast thy fall!<br />
	Fierce to the left he drives, where from the plain<br />
	The flying Grecians strove their ships to gain;<br />
	Swift through the wall their horse and chariots pass&#39;d,<br />
	The gates half&ndash;open&#39;d to receive the last.<br />
	Thither, exulting in his force, he flies:<br />
	His following host with clamours rend the skies:<br />
	To plunge the Grecians headlong in the main,<br />
	Such their proud hopes; but all their hopes were vain!</p>
<p>
	To guard the gates, two mighty chiefs attend,<br />
	Who from the Lapiths&#39; warlike race descend;<br />
	This Polypoetes, great Perithous&#39; heir,<br />
	And that Leonteus, like the god of war.<br />
	As two tall oaks, before the wall they rise;<br />
	Their roots in earth, their heads amidst the skies:<br />
	Whose spreading arms with leafy honours crown&#39;d,<br />
	Forbid the tempest, and protect the ground;<br />
	High on the hills appears their stately form,<br />
	And their deep roots for ever brave the storm.<br />
	So graceful these, and so the shock they stand<br />
	Of raging Asius, and his furious band.<br />
	Orestes, Acamas, in front appear,<br />
	And OEnomaus and Thoon close the rear:<br />
	In vain their clamours shake the ambient fields,<br />
	In vain around them beat their hollow shields;<br />
	The fearless brothers on the Grecians call,<br />
	To guard their navies, and defend the wall.<br />
	Even when they saw Troy&#39;s sable troops impend,<br />
	And Greece tumultuous from her towers descend,<br />
	Forth from the portals rush&#39;d the intrepid pair,<br />
	Opposed their breasts, and stood themselves the war.<br />
	So two wild boars spring furious from their den,<br />
	Roused with the cries of dogs and voice of men;<br />
	On every side the crackling trees they tear,<br />
	And root the shrubs, and lay the forest bare;<br />
	They gnash their tusks, with fire their eye&ndash;balls roll,<br />
	Till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul.<br />
	Around their heads the whistling javelins sung,<br />
	With sounding strokes their brazen targets rung;<br />
	Fierce was the fight, while yet the Grecian powers<br />
	Maintain&#39;d the walls, and mann&#39;d the lofty towers:<br />
	To save their fleet their last efforts they try,<br />
	And stones and darts in mingled tempests fly.</p>
<p>
	As when sharp Boreas blows abroad, and brings<br />
	The dreary winter on his frozen wings;<br />
	Beneath the low&ndash;hung clouds the sheets of snow<br />
	Descend, and whiten all the fields below:<br />
	So fast the darts on either army pour,<br />
	So down the rampires rolls the rocky shower:<br />
	Heavy, and thick, resound the batter&#39;d shields,<br />
	And the deaf echo rattles round the fields.</p>
<p>
	With shame repulsed, with grief and fury driven,<br />
	The frantic Asius thus accuses Heaven:<br />
	&quot;In powers immortal who shall now believe?<br />
	Can those too flatter, and can Jove deceive?<br />
	What man could doubt but Troy&#39;s victorious power<br />
	Should humble Greece, and this her fatal hour?<br />
	But like when wasps from hollow crannies drive,<br />
	To guard the entrance of their common hive,<br />
	Darkening the rock, while with unwearied wings<br />
	They strike the assailants, and infix their stings;<br />
	A race determined, that to death contend:<br />
	So fierce these Greeks their last retreats defend.<br />
	Gods! shall two warriors only guard their gates,<br />
	Repel an army, and defraud the fates?&quot;</p>
<p>
	These empty accents mingled with the wind,<br />
	Nor moved great Jove&#39;s unalterable mind;<br />
	To godlike Hector and his matchless might<br />
	Was owed the glory of the destined fight.<br />
	Like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried,<br />
	And all the gates sustain&#39;d an equal tide;<br />
	Through the long walls the stony showers were heard,<br />
	The blaze of flames, the flash of arms appear&#39;d.<br />
	The spirit of a god my breast inspire,<br />
	To raise each act to life, and sing with fire!<br />
	While Greece unconquer&#39;d kept alive the war,<br />
	Secure of death, confiding in despair;<br />
	And all her guardian gods, in deep dismay,<br />
	With unassisting arms deplored the day.</p>
<p>
	Even yet the dauntless Lapithae maintain<br />
	The dreadful pass, and round them heap the slain.<br />
	First Damasus, by Polypoetes&#39; steel,<br />
	Pierced through his helmet&#39;s brazen visor, fell;<br />
	The weapon drank the mingled brains and gore!<br />
	The warrior sinks, tremendous now no more!<br />
	Next Ormenus and Pylon yield their breath:<br />
	Nor less Leonteus strews the field with death;<br />
	First through the belt Hippomachus he gored,<br />
	Then sudden waved his unresisted sword:<br />
	Antiphates, as through the ranks he broke,<br />
	The falchion struck, and fate pursued the stroke:<br />
	Iamenus, Orestes, Menon, bled;<br />
	And round him rose a monument of dead.<br />
	Meantime, the bravest of the Trojan crew,<br />
	Bold Hector and Polydamas, pursue;<br />
	Fierce with impatience on the works to fall,<br />
	And wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall.<br />
	These on the farther bank now stood and gazed,<br />
	By Heaven alarm&#39;d, by prodigies amazed:<br />
	A signal omen stopp&#39;d the passing host,<br />
	Their martial fury in their wonder lost.<br />
	Jove&#39;s bird on sounding pinions beat the skies;<br />
	A bleeding serpent of enormous size,<br />
	His talons truss&#39;d; alive, and curling round,<br />
	He stung the bird, whose throat received the wound:<br />
	Mad with the smart, he drops the fatal prey,<br />
	In airy circles wings his painful way,<br />
	Floats on the winds, and rends the heaven with cries:<br />
	Amidst the host the fallen serpent lies.<br />
	They, pale with terror, mark its spires unroll&#39;d,<br />
	And Jove&#39;s portent with beating hearts behold.<br />
	Then first Polydamas the silence broke,<br />
	Long weigh&#39;d the signal, and to Hector spoke:</p>
<p>
	&quot;How oft, my brother, thy reproach I bear,<br />
	For words well meant, and sentiments sincere?<br />
	True to those counsels which I judge the best,<br />
	I tell the faithful dictates of my breast.<br />
	To speak his thoughts is every freeman&#39;s right,<br />
	In peace, in war, in council, and in fight;<br />
	And all I move, deferring to thy sway,<br />
	But tends to raise that power which I obey.<br />
	Then hear my words, nor may my words be vain!<br />
	Seek not this day the Grecian ships to gain;<br />
	For sure, to warn us, Jove his omen sent,<br />
	And thus my mind explains its clear event:<br />
	The victor eagle, whose sinister flight<br />
	Retards our host, and fills our hearts with fright,<br />
	Dismiss&#39;d his conquest in the middle skies,<br />
	Allow&#39;d to seize, but not possess the prize;<br />
	Thus, though we gird with fires the Grecian fleet,<br />
	Though these proud bulwalks tumble at our feet,<br />
	Toils unforeseen, and fiercer, are decreed;<br />
	More woes shall follow, and more heroes bleed.<br />
	So bodes my soul, and bids me thus advise;<br />
	For thus a skilful seer would read the skies.&quot;</p>
<p>
	To him then Hector with disdain return&#39;d:<br />
	(Fierce as he spoke, his eyes with fury burn&#39;d:)<br />
	&quot;Are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue?<br />
	Thy will is partial, not thy reason wrong:<br />
	Or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent,<br />
	Sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent.<br />
	What coward counsels would thy madness move<br />
	Against the word, the will reveal&#39;d of Jove?<br />
	The leading sign, the irrevocable nod,<br />
	And happy thunders of the favouring god,<br />
	These shall I slight, and guide my wavering mind<br />
	By wandering birds that flit with every wind?<br />
	Ye vagrants of the sky! your wings extend,<br />
	Or where the suns arise, or where descend;<br />
	To right, to left, unheeded take your way,<br />
	While I the dictates of high heaven obey.<br />
	Without a sign his sword the brave man draws,<br />
	And asks no omen but his country&#39;s cause.<br />
	But why should&#39;st thou suspect the war&#39;s success?<br />
	None fears it more, as none promotes it less:<br />
	Though all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire,<br />
	Trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire.<br />
	Troy and her sons may find a general grave,<br />
	But thou canst live, for thou canst be a slave.<br />
	Yet should the fears that wary mind suggests<br />
	Spread their cold poison through our soldiers&#39; breasts,<br />
	My javelin can revenge so base a part,<br />
	And free the soul that quivers in thy heart.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Furious he spoke, and, rushing to the wall,<br />
	Calls on his host; his host obey the call;<br />
	With ardour follow where their leader flies:<br />
	Redoubling clamours thunder in the skies.<br />
	Jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of Ide,<br />
	And drifts of dust the clouded navy hide;<br />
	He fills the Greeks with terror and dismay,<br />
	And gives great Hector the predestined day.<br />
	Strong in themselves, but stronger in his aid,<br />
	Close to the works their rigid siege they laid.<br />
	In vain the mounds and massy beams defend,<br />
	While these they undermine, and those they rend;<br />
	Upheaved the piles that prop the solid wall;<br />
	And heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall.<br />
	Greece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarms;<br />
	The crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arms,<br />
	Shield touching shield, a long refulgent row;<br />
	Whence hissing darts, incessant, rain below.<br />
	The bold Ajaces fly from tower to tower,<br />
	And rouse, with flame divine, the Grecian power.<br />
	The generous impulse every Greek obeys;<br />
	Threats urge the fearful; and the valiant, praise.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Fellows in arms! whose deeds are known to fame,<br />
	And you, whose ardour hopes an equal name!<br />
	Since not alike endued with force or art;<br />
	Behold a day when each may act his part!<br />
	A day to fire the brave, and warm the cold,<br />
	To gain new glories, or augment the old.<br />
	Urge those who stand, and those who faint, excite;<br />
	Drown Hector&#39;s vaunts in loud exhorts of fight;<br />
	Conquest, not safety, fill the thoughts of all;<br />
	Seek not your fleet, but sally from the wall;<br />
	So Jove once more may drive their routed train,<br />
	And Troy lie trembling in her walls again.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Their ardour kindles all the Grecian powers;<br />
	And now the stones descend in heavier showers.<br />
	As when high Jove his sharp artillery forms,<br />
	And opes his cloudy magazine of storms;<br />
	In winter&#39;s bleak un comfortable reign,<br />
	A snowy inundation hides the plain;<br />
	He stills the winds, and bids the skies to sleep;<br />
	Then pours the silent tempest thick and deep;<br />
	And first the mountain&ndash;tops are cover&#39;d o&#39;er,<br />
	Then the green fields, and then the sandy shore;<br />
	Bent with the weight, the nodding woods are seen,<br />
	And one bright waste hides all the works of men:<br />
	The circling seas, alone absorbing all,<br />
	Drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall:<br />
	So from each side increased the stony rain,<br />
	And the white ruin rises o&#39;er the plain.</p>
<p>
	Thus godlike Hector and his troops contend<br />
	To force the ramparts, and the gates to rend:<br />
	Nor Troy could conquer, nor the Greeks would yield,<br />
	Till great Sarpedon tower&#39;d amid the field;<br />
	For mighty Jove inspired with martial flame<br />
	His matchless son, and urged him on to fame.<br />
	In arms he shines, conspicuous from afar,<br />
	And bears aloft his ample shield in air;<br />
	Within whose orb the thick bull&ndash;hides were roll&#39;d,<br />
	Ponderous with brass, and bound with ductile gold:<br />
	And while two pointed javelins arm his hands,<br />
	Majestic moves along, and leads his Lycian bands.</p>
<p>
	So press&#39;d with hunger, from the mountain&#39;s brow<br />
	Descends a lion on the flocks below;<br />
	So stalks the lordly savage o&#39;er the plain,<br />
	In sullen majesty, and stern disdain:<br />
	In vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar,<br />
	And shepherds gall him with an iron war;<br />
	Regardless, furious, he pursues his way;<br />
	He foams, he roars, he rends the panting prey.</p>
<p>
	Resolved alike, divine Sarpedon glows<br />
	With generous rage that drives him on the foes.<br />
	He views the towers, and meditates their fall,<br />
	To sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall;<br />
	Then casting on his friend an ardent look,<br />
	Fired with the thirst of glory, thus he spoke:</p>
<p>
	&quot;Why boast we, Glaucus! our extended reign,<br />
	Where Xanthus&#39; streams enrich the Lycian plain,<br />
	Our numerous herds that range the fruitful field,<br />
	And hills where vines their purple harvest yield,<br />
	Our foaming bowls with purer nectar crown&#39;d,<br />
	Our feasts enhanced with music&#39;s sprightly sound?<br />
	Why on those shores are we with joy survey&#39;d,<br />
	Admired as heroes, and as gods obey&#39;d,<br />
	Unless great acts superior merit prove,<br />
	And vindicate the bounteous powers above?<br />
	&#39;Tis ours, the dignity they give to grace;<br />
	The first in valour, as the first in place;<br />
	That when with wondering eyes our martial bands<br />
	Behold our deeds transcending our commands,<br />
	Such, they may cry, deserve the sovereign state,<br />
	Whom those that envy dare not imitate!<br />
	Could all our care elude the gloomy grave,<br />
	Which claims no less the fearful and the brave,<br />
	For lust of fame I should not vainly dare<br />
	In fighting fields, nor urge thy soul to war.<br />
	But since, alas! ignoble age must come,<br />
	Disease, and death&#39;s inexorable doom<br />
	The life, which others pay, let us bestow,<br />
	And give to fame what we to nature owe;<br />
	Brave though we fall, and honour&#39;d if we live,<br />
	Or let us glory gain, or glory give!&quot;</p>
<p>
	He said; his words the listening chief inspire<br />
	With equal warmth, and rouse the warrior&#39;s fire;<br />
	The troops pursue their leaders with delight,<br />
	Rush to the foe, and claim the promised fight.<br />
	Menestheus from on high the storm beheld<br />
	Threatening the fort, and blackening in the field:<br />
	Around the walls he gazed, to view from far<br />
	What aid appear&#39;d to avert the approaching war,<br />
	And saw where Teucer with the Ajaces stood,<br />
	Of fight insatiate, prodigal of blood.<br />
	In vain he calls; the din of helms and shields<br />
	Rings to the skies, and echoes through the fields,<br />
	The brazen hinges fly, the walls resound,<br />
	Heaven trembles, roar the mountains, thunders all the ground<br />
	Then thus to Thoos: &quot;Hence with speed (he said),<br />
	And urge the bold Ajaces to our aid;<br />
	Their strength, united, best may help to bear<br />
	The bloody labours of the doubtful war:<br />
	Hither the Lycian princes bend their course,<br />
	The best and bravest of the hostile force.<br />
	But if too fiercely there the foes contend,<br />
	Let Telamon, at least, our towers defend,<br />
	And Teucer haste with his unerring bow<br />
	To share the danger, and repel the foe.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Swift, at the word, the herald speeds along<br />
	The lofty ramparts, through the martial throng,<br />
	And finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore,<br />
	Opposed in combat on the dusty shore.<br />
	&quot;Ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands!<br />
	Your aid (said Thoos) Peteus&#39; son demands;<br />
	Your strength, united, best may help to bear<br />
	The bloody labours of the doubtful war:<br />
	Thither the Lycian princes bend their course,<br />
	The best and bravest of the hostile force.<br />
	But if too fiercely, here, the foes contend,<br />
	At least, let Telamon those towers defend,<br />
	And Teucer haste with his unerring bow<br />
	To share the danger, and repel the foe.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Straight to the fort great Ajax turn&#39;d his care,<br />
	And thus bespoke his brothers of the war:<br />
	&quot;Now, valiant Lycomede! exert your might,<br />
	And, brave Oileus, prove your force in fight;<br />
	To you I trust the fortune of the field,<br />
	Till by this arm the foe shall be repell&#39;d:<br />
	That done, expect me to complete the day<br />
	Then with his sevenfold shield he strode away.<br />
	With equal steps bold Teucer press&#39;d the shore,<br />
	Whose fatal bow the strong Pandion bore.</p>
<p>
	High on the walls appear&#39;d the Lycian powers,<br />
	Like some black tempest gathering round the towers:<br />
	The Greeks, oppress&#39;d, their utmost force unite,<br />
	Prepared to labour in the unequal fight:<br />
	The war renews, mix&#39;d shouts and groans arise;<br />
	Tumultuous clamour mounts, and thickens in the skies.<br />
	Fierce Ajax first the advancing host invades,<br />
	And sends the brave Epicles to the shades,<br />
	Sarpedon&#39;s friend. Across the warrior&#39;s way,<br />
	Rent from the walls, a rocky fragment lay;<br />
	In modern ages not the strongest swain<br />
	Could heave the unwieldy burden from the plain:<br />
	He poised, and swung it round; then toss&#39;d on high,<br />
	It flew with force, and labour&#39;d up the sky;<br />
	Full on the Lycian&#39;s helmet thundering down,<br />
	The ponderous ruin crush&#39;d his batter&#39;d crown.<br />
	As skilful divers from some airy steep<br />
	Headlong descend, and shoot into the deep,<br />
	So falls Epicles; then in groans expires,<br />
	And murmuring to the shades the soul retires.</p>
<p>
	While to the ramparts daring Glaucus drew,<br />
	From Teucer&#39;s hand a winged arrow flew;<br />
	The bearded shaft the destined passage found,<br />
	And on his naked arm inflicts a wound.<br />
	The chief, who fear&#39;d some foe&#39;s insulting boast<br />
	Might stop the progress of his warlike host,<br />
	Conceal&#39;d the wound, and, leaping from his height<br />
	Retired reluctant from the unfinish&#39;d fight.<br />
	Divine Sarpedon with regret beheld<br />
	Disabled Glaucus slowly quit the field;<br />
	His beating breast with generous ardour glows,<br />
	He springs to fight, and flies upon the foes.<br />
	Alcmaon first was doom&#39;d his force to feel;<br />
	Deep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel;<br />
	Then from the yawning wound with fury tore<br />
	The spear, pursued by gushing streams of gore:<br />
	Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,<br />
	His brazen armour rings against the ground.</p>
<p>
	Swift to the battlement the victor flies,<br />
	Tugs with full force, and every nerve applies:<br />
	It shakes; the ponderous stones disjointed yield;<br />
	The rolling ruins smoke along the field.<br />
	A mighty breach appears; the walls lie bare;<br />
	And, like a deluge, rushes in the war.<br />
	At once bold Teucer draws the twanging bow,<br />
	And Ajax sends his javelin at the foe;<br />
	Fix&#39;d in his belt the feather&#39;d weapon stood,<br />
	And through his buckler drove the trembling wood;<br />
	But Jove was present in the dire debate,<br />
	To shield his offspring, and avert his fate.<br />
	The prince gave back, not meditating flight,<br />
	But urging vengeance, and severer fight;<br />
	Then raised with hope, and fired with glory&#39;s charms,<br />
	His fainting squadrons to new fury warms.<br />
	&quot;O where, ye Lycians, is the strength you boast?<br />
	Your former fame and ancient virtue lost!<br />
	The breach lies open, but your chief in vain<br />
	Attempts alone the guarded pass to gain:<br />
	Unite, and soon that hostile fleet shall fall:<br />
	The force of powerful union conquers all.&quot;</p>
<p>
	This just rebuke inflamed the Lycian crew;<br />
	They join, they thicken, and the assault renew:<br />
	Unmoved the embodied Greeks their fury dare,<br />
	And fix&#39;d support the weight of all the war;<br />
	Nor could the Greeks repel the Lycian powers,<br />
	Nor the bold Lycians force the Grecian towers.<br />
	As on the confines of adjoining grounds,<br />
	Two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds;<br />
	They tug, they sweat; but neither gain, nor yield,<br />
	One foot, one inch, of the contended field;<br />
	Thus obstinate to death, they fight, they fall;<br />
	Nor these can keep, nor those can win the wall.<br />
	Their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound,<br />
	Loud strokes are heard, and rattling arms resound;<br />
	The copious slaughter covers all the shore,<br />
	And the high ramparts drip with human gore.</p>
<p>
	As when two scales are charged with doubtful loads,<br />
	From side to side the trembling balance nods,<br />
	(While some laborious matron, just and poor,<br />
	With nice exactness weighs her woolly store,)<br />
	Till poised aloft, the resting beam suspends<br />
	Each equal weight; nor this, nor that, descends:<br />
	So stood the war, till Hector&#39;s matchless might,<br />
	With fates prevailing, turn&#39;d the scale of fight.<br />
	Fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies,<br />
	And fires his host with loud repeated cries.<br />
	&quot;Advance, ye Trojans! lend your valiant hands,<br />
	Haste to the fleet, and toss the blazing brands!&quot;<br />
	They hear, they run; and, gathering at his call,<br />
	Raise scaling engines, and ascend the wall:<br />
	Around the works a wood of glittering spears<br />
	Shoots up, and all the rising host appears.<br />
	A ponderous stone bold Hector heaved to throw,<br />
	Pointed above, and rough and gross below:<br />
	Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,<br />
	Such men as live in these degenerate days:<br />
	Yet this, as easy as a swain could bear<br />
	The snowy fleece, he toss&#39;d, and shook in air;<br />
	For Jove upheld, and lighten&#39;d of its load<br />
	The unwieldy rock, the labour of a god.<br />
	Thus arm&#39;d, before the folded gates he came,<br />
	Of massy substance, and stupendous frame;<br />
	With iron bars and brazen hinges strong,<br />
	On lofty beams of solid timber hung:<br />
	Then thundering through the planks with forceful sway,<br />
	Drives the sharp rock; the solid beams give way,<br />
	The folds are shatter&#39;d; from the crackling door<br />
	Leap the resounding bars, the flying hinges roar.<br />
	Now rushing in, the furious chief appears,<br />
	Gloomy as night! and shakes two shining spears:<br />
	A dreadful gleam from his bright armour came,<br />
	And from his eye&ndash;balls flash&#39;d the living flame.<br />
	He moves a god, resistless in his course,<br />
	And seems a match for more than mortal force.<br />
	Then pouring after, through the gaping space,<br />
	A tide of Trojans flows, and fills the place;<br />
	The Greeks behold, they tremble, and they fly;<br />
	The shore is heap&#39;d with death, and tumult rends the sky.</p>
