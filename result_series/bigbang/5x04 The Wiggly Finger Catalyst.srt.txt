The entrance to the dungeon
is a moss-covered door.
You manage to open it
only to find yourself face-to-face...
...with a hideous,
foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre.
What do you do?
I say, "Hey, Ma, what's for dinner?"
Seventeen.
The ogre is amused by your joke
and allows you to pass.
By the by, I liked it too.
How go the wedding plans, Howard?
Great. Spent five hours last night
at Macy's registering for gifts.
I'm finally gonna have that earthenware
asparagus dish I've always wanted, heh.
See, this is the good thing about
having a girlfriend 9000 miles away.
I can spend my nights
doing whatever I want.
Like playing nerd games with us...
...and then taking
a suspiciously long shower?
Maybe.
We enter the dungeon.
You see a dragon.
Really?
So we're playing Dungeons and Dragons.
And we walk into a dungeon
and see a dragon?
- Isn't that a little on the nose?
- When you play Chutes and Ladders...
...do you complain about all the chutes
and the ladders?
Are you gonna eat that whole pie?
Maybe. Why not?
Who do I have in my life
to watch my figure for?
Oh, God,
did you watch Bridget Jones again?
No, it's just that
everybody's got someone.
Sheldon's with Amy,
Howard's getting married...
- ...you're dating my sister.
- Now that Howard's getting married...
...maybe he'll inflate
one of his old girlfriends for you, heh.
You know who I blame
for my loneliness?
The United States of America.
Your movies and your TV shows...
...promised streets paved with beautiful
blonde women with big bazongas.
Eat another pie,
you'll have your own bazongas.
That's cruel.
You know it goes straight to my hips.
Gentlemen, please focus.
- You're facing a fire-breathing dragon.
- Unh, I don't know if I wanna play anymore.
Because you don't have a girlfriend?
If that becomes a reason...
...not to play Dungeons and Dragons,
this game's in serious trouble.
Now, I assume we use this same wax
later on...
...to neaten up
each other's bikini regions.
Yeah, my bikini region is fine.
Who's shocked? I'm not.
So, Bernadette,
how's the wedding planning going?
And I'm not asking
as a prospective bridesmaid.
Pick me. Pick me.
We went cake tasting yesterday.
Raj came along.
He cried and ate half the samples.
Oh, poor guy. He's so lonely.
We should set him up with someone.
You know,
I met a really cute girl at work.
She's married to a guy
in one of our drug trials.
Well, hello? She's married, heh.
Yeah, but her husband
is in serious congestive heart failure...
...and a little birdie told me
he's in the placebo group.
Okay, so future grief-stricken widow
is the one to beat.
- You ready to order?
- One moment.
I'm conducting an experiment.
With Dungeons and Dragons dice?
Yes. From here on in...
...I've decided to make all trivial
decisions with a throw of the dice.
Thus freeing up my mind
to do what it does best...
...enlighten and amaze.
Page 14, item seven.
So, what's for dinner?
A side of corn succotash.
Hmm, interesting.
Um, Howard,
can I see you for a minute, please?
Ugh, I don't wanna show any more of your
friends how I can fit in the booster seats.
Uh, no, that's not it.
Just come with me, please?
Let's see what I'll be washing
that succotash down with.
A pitcher of margaritas.
Do you really want that?
That's the great thing.
It doesn't matter.
My mind is freed up
to think about more important things.
What's it thinking about now?
Hamburgers and lemonade.
Um, Raj, there's someone
I want you to meet.
This is my friend, Emily.
I know her from spin class.
No. Raj, relax.
She can't hear you. She's deaf.
Emily, this is our friend Raj.
- Heh.
- Aw.
Look at you guys, just hitting it off.
I am so good.
Hi.
She says, "it's nice to meet you."
Did she really mean that
or was she signing it sarcastically?
Raj says, "It's nice to meet you too." Heh.
Uh, she says she has to go back
to her family.
But Penny has her number
if you wanna text her and get together.
Okay, I'm gonna play it cool.
Tell her, "Maybe. Whatever, babe."
He'll text you, heh.
Huh. Look at that. I have a date.
I love America again.
And now for dessert.
Come on, hot fudge sundae.
Come on, hot fudge sundae.
Bam! That's what I'm talking about.
Okay. As soon as she gets here,
so she knows I'm cool with it...
...I'm going to make a joke
about her being deaf.
I was thinking,
"Hey, did you hear the one about...?
Oh, no, I bet you didn't."
Maybe we should revisit
your lonely, fat guy plan, heh.
Oh, she's here.
No joke.
- She's sorry she's late.
- Oh, tell her it doesn't matter.
Tell her her eyes shimmer
like opalescent lilies...
...in the lake of the palace
of the celestial maidens.
Really?
That's the first thing you wanna say?
- I worked on it all night. Use it.
- I don't know the sign for "opalescent."
- Then spell it.
- I don't know how to spell it.
You're blowing this for me.
He likes your eyes, heh.
You're making me sound
like a caveman.
"Thank you, you have nice eyes too."
Really?
Ask her how many children she wants...
...and whatever number she says,
say, "Me too."
No.
Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice
like James Earl Jones.
She doesn't know
what James Earl Jones sounds like.
Great. Then she won't know I'm lying.
Let's see, what else can I tell you
about me that would make you like me?
Uh...
Oh, I love music.
Do you love music?
You really wanna ask her that?
Oh. You're right.
Heh, everyone loves music.
She says,
"Do you play an instrument?"
No, but when I was 6 years old...
...I tried to start a boy band
called Frankie Goes to Bollywood.
But I couldn't get any other boys
to join...
...so my parents asked the servants
to be my backup dancers.
Wait, when you sign servants,
don't sign it like I'm bragging.
Sign it in a way that I sound humble,
with just a hint of:
"That's right, I had servants."
- Do you hear yourself?
- Yes, but she doesn't.
So get signing, hand monkey.
I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus
every day.
And then on Christmas morning...
...under the tree is a little puppy
with a red ribbon.
- What are you doing?
- Texting Bernadette I'm gonna be late.
- Dude, what is she saying?
- It's a funny story about a puppy.
Just smile and laugh.
- Quick, stop smiling.
- What? Why?
The puppy died. It choked
on a doll head. Sad face, sad face.
It's a little hard to see
with the city lights...
...but that W-shaped constellation
is Cassiopeia.
And she was the mother of Andromeda,
who's over there.
Look, pretty stars.
This is her car, heh.
She hopes she can see you again
sometime.
Good, good. Uh...
Oh, boy, uh, help me out here.
Does she want me to kiss her or not?
I speak sign language,
I don't read minds.
- If you were me, would you kiss her?
- Yeah, but I'm the make-out king.
I was so smooth on that date.
You? I made you smooth.
You were an idiot.
Whatever, dude. She kissed me.
Yeah, well, it might have been
on your lips but it was my kiss.
Fine. Let's agree she kissed
both of us.
Okay.
Mustache is looking good there,
Sheldon.
Don't thank me. Thank the dice.
They told me
what percentage of my face to shave.
Why are you still doing this?
Because it's working.
In the past few weeks,
unburdened by trivial decisions...
...I've co-authored two papers
in notable peer-reviewed journals...
...and I'm close to figuring out
why the Large Hadron Collider...
...has yet to isolate
the Higgs boson particle.
You left out, got chafed testicles
because you no longer wear underpants.
The dice giveth
and the dice taketh away.
- Is Raj out with Emily again?
- Yeah. Every night for the last month.
Wow. I can't believe he has a girlfriend.
Me neither.
Here's some other fun news
on the Raj-Emily front.
He gave her a pair of diamond earrings
and leased her a car.
You're kidding.
- Think she's taking advantage of him?
- Oh, of course not.
She wouldn't do something like that.
She's deaf.
Deaf women can't be gold diggers?
Handicapped people are nice, Leonard.
Everyone knows that.
I actually have information about Raj that
would be helpful with this discussion.
Could you tell us?
Let's see.
Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.
Wait. Hang on. Doubles. Roll again.
Okay, get this.
It doesn't matter
if he's showering her with gifts...
...because the Koothrappalis
are vastly wealthy.
- What do you mean "vastly wealthy"?
- Well, "wealthy" means a lot of money.
"Vastly" means even more.
I'm not sure what's tripping you up.
I know they have money.
I don't think it's that much.
No, you're wrong.
As you know, a few years ago...
...I achieved one of my lesser dreams
and became a notary public.
Well, from time to time,
I notarize banking documents for Raj.
The Koothrappalis aren't just rich,
they're Richie Rich rich.
Well, so how much is that?
About halfway between Bruce Wayne
and Scrooge McDuck.
The last time we went to the zoo...
...that son of a bitch
made me buy him a churro.
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude
but I need to go call Raj's sister...
...who I love so much.
Ahem, so vastly much.
Okay, so he's got money,
and it's a few gifts, and a car.
And she got him
to pay off all her credit cards.
What? He paid off her credit cards?
Damn it, I could have dated Raj
for a couple months.
But I wouldn't have because I'm not that
kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj.
He's not gonna listen, he's in love.
Can't figure out what to do?
I remember those days.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to...
...stay right here.
- This is a bad idea. We should go.
- No.
I'm the one that introduced him to her.
I've gotta say something.
Wow.
- You're engaged to my friend.
- Hey, Bernadette doesn't mind...
...where I get my motor running,
as long as I park in the right garage.
I can't believe you're engaged
to my friend.
Oh, here she comes.
Smart. Whisper,
so the deaf chick can't hear you.
- Hi.
- Oh, hey. Hi. Nice to see you.
Um, can we talk to you about Raj?
She says, "Sure, what about him?"
Okay. Um, gosh, how do I start?
Um, see, Raj is kind of naive.
He hasn't dated
a whole lot of women.
And I'm concerned that,
without meaning to...
...you might be taking advantage
of him.
By letting him buy you
a bunch of expensive things.
I... Howard, focus.
- Tell her what I'm saying.
- Right.
Are you a gold digger or not?
Oh, something, something. Who
the something do you think you are?
Mind your own something business
and go something yourself.
Oh, ha, ha, wait, I got this now.
- I'm so mad at you.
- Okay, wait.
How dare you ambush my girlfriend
at the gym?
We didn't mean for it
to be an ambush.
It's kind of impossible not to sneak up
on deaf people.
And, hey,
since when are you so chatty?
- I'm hammered.
- Raj, come here.
This girl is trouble.
What kind of relationship is it where
you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?
The best one I've ever had.
Okay, come on,
you know you can do better.
Aha!
I see what's going on here.
You and I had our crazy night
together.
And now you can't stand to see me
with another woman.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
It's okay,
I can't get mad at your feelings.
I don't have feelings.
Yeah, that's good.
Keep telling yourself that.
He is cuter now that I know he's rich.
I have a surprise for you.
Cover your eyes.
Open them.
It's a real ruby.
It was a little expensive,
but no one can put a price on love.
Although the people at Cartier
took a pretty good shot at it.
Oh, Mummy, Daddy,
what a nice surprise.
No, it's not a nice surprise,
it's a bad surprise.
- Penny called us.
- Penny?
She told us you're spending all our money
on your new girlfriend.
I just got her a couple of things.
She gives me things too.
Yeah, yeah. I'm a gynecologist.
I know exactly what she gives you.
You need to find a nice Indian girl
from a good family.
If you keep seeing this woman,
you're cut off.
What? You're gonna make me choose
between the woman I love...
...and the money
I have very strong feelings for?
It's up to you.
- Well, I choose love.
- Heh, you're an idiot.
Love doesn't last.
Well, he's going to find out eventually.
Think about it.
My, uh, parents are making me choose
between money and you.
I choose you.
No. I think we'll have to return
the car.
And the necklace. Yeah, that too.
But none of those things matter
because we have something better.
We have love.
- Oh, Penny, I hurt so bad.
- Uh...
I know. I know.
Sometimes I put the TV on mute
just to pretend she's still with me.
But I can't watch the closed-captioning
without crying.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I wish I can make you feel better.
Seriously?
I'm heartbroken
and you're hitting on me?
What? No.
Look, Penny, you're great,
but I had a long talk with my parents.
And they said if I date an Indian girl,
I get a Maserati.
Mm, oh, cheesecake,
you're just as good as a woman...
...even though I can't have sex
with you.
Try throwing it in the microwave
for a few seconds.
Should I use the restroom
or wait until we get home?
Come on,
Papa needs to void his bladder.
Oh, that's not what you wanna see
after three buttermilks.
Here you go, boys.
I'll pick it up when you're ready.
- Thanks for dinner, buddy.
- Yeah, real big of you.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Oh, don't cheap out on the tip.
We all know you're loaded now.
