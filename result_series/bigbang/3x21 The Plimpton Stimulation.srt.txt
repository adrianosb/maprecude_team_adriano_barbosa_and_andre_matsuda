- Hold.
- What?
Explain your sneeze.
- I'm sorry?
- Do you have allergies?
- No.
- Too much pepper on your salad?
- I don't put pepper on salads.
- I've heard enough. Sit over there.
Come on, I don't wanna sit by myself.
That's what Typhoid Mary said.
Clearly, her friends buckled.
Guys, help me.
- Sheldon, come on.
- Yeah, it's just one sneeze.
- You're on your own.
- See you, buddy.
Oh, Leonard, I have something for you.
Per our roommate agreement,
this is your 24-hour notice...
...that I will be having
a non-related female...
...spending two nights
in our apartment.
When you say non-related female,
you still mean human, right?
Well, of course.
Pets are banned by the agreement,
with the exception of service animals...
...such as Seeing Eye dogs
and, one day...
...cybernetically enhanced
helper monkeys.
Are you planning
on kidnapping a woman?
- Sarcasm?
- Yes.
But mixed with genuine concern.
For your information...
...I'll be playing host
to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.
- Cosmological physicist from Princeton?
- Yes.
And until you acquire
a surgical mask...
...please address your comments to me
through a napkin.
We've been corresponding for years
about our mutual interest...
...in gravitational wave signatures
of inflatons in the early universe.
Now she's under consideration
for a position at our university.
Why didn't you tell me
you knew Elizabeth Plimpton?
I am a huge fan of hers.
I didn't realize I had to share
my connection...
...with things you're a fan of,
but, very well.
You enjoy Canadian bacon.
I've been to Toronto.
- Okay, fine. Where is she gonna sleep?
- My room, of course.
Holy crap.
Holy crap.
- Yeah, I have a two-part question.
- Go ahead.
A, are you kidding me?
And B, seriously,
are you freaking kidding me?
A, I rarely kid.
And B, when I do kid, you will know it
by my use of the word "buzzinga."
So you're saying the two of you are
going to be sleeping in the same bed?
Yes.
Buzzinga.
Leonard?
Thank you.
Why is a renowned scientist staying
in our apartment instead of a hotel?
She doesn't care for hotels.
And who can blame her?
Windows that don't open,
multi-user linens...
...keys shaped like credit cards.
As if one walks around
with unassigned slots in one's wallet.
All right, I believe I have time
for one more question.
Yes, Raj?
When can I sit with you again?
When I've seen two negative
throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart.
You know the drill.
All right, if you'll excuse me...
...I am off to start
a prophylactic course of antibiotics.
I can't believe he's friends
with Elizabeth Plimpton.
I can't believe
they let him into Canada.
Whoa. You heard the man.
Where's your throat cultures?
- Kidding. Sit down.
- Ha.
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Oh, Penny, excellent.
I have a question
about these maxi pads.
Are the wings truly functional
or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?
What? What are you
doing with...? What?
The stock boy at Walgreens was
frustratingly uninformed on the subject.
Sheldon, what are you doing
with maxi pads?
I have a lady friend who will
be staying with me for a few days.
Oh.
What?
I want her to feel at home.
I also bought scented soaps,
pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews...
...and what is apparently a yogurt
specifically designed...
...to regulate the female bowel.
Wait. Wait, hold on. Back up.
You're having a woman stay with you?
Yes. Why does that seem
to flabbergast everybody?
No, no, no, I'm not flabbergasted.
I'm puzzled.
Yeah, let's go with puzzled.
A word of warning:
My guest is a noted physicist...
...and the leading expert
on quantum cosmology...
...so please try to avoid wasting her time
with female gibber-gabber.
Female gibber-gabber?
Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks...
...gossip about your friends,
Brad and Angelina.
No, they're not my friends.
Not surprised, considering how
you talk about them behind their backs.
She's here. She's here.
How do I look? Do I look smart?
Oh, good grief. This isn't about you.
Coming.
Now, listen, one of the great minds
of the 21st century...
...is about to play host to one of the
other great minds of the 21st century.
So pay attention.
Years from now, my biographer
might ask you about this event.
Well, I have so many things
to tell your biographer.
Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness.
I completely forgot your address.
But then, I remembered
that I'd written it on my hand.
Lucky I didn't confuse it with
what I'd written on my other hand...
...which are the coordinates
for a neutron star.
Because if I tried to go there,
I'd be crushed by hyper gravity.
- Anyway, hello.
- Hello.
- Nice to finally meet you in person.
- I would imagine it is.
This is my friend and roommate,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
Hi-lo.
Oops. I started to say hi, and then
I switched to hello in the middle.
It came out "hi-lo."
Duh.
It's nice to meet you.
I've read both your books
and your papers.
I'm Leonard.
I live here. You're brilliant.
I apologize.
He's only an experimental physicist.
No need to apologize. Some of my
best friends are experimental physicists.
Well, not my best friends.
But I know them.
My best friend
is a molecular chemist named Wendy.
I'm sorry, I'm rambling.
- Hi-lo.
- Heh, heh.
Hungry? Can I offer you anything?
If anyone should offer her anything,
it should be me.
Elizabeth, can I get you something?
Perhaps a feminine-hygiene product
or a bowel-regulating yogurt?
Interesting choices.
Based on my current needs,
I guess I'd pick the yogurt.
Excellent.
If the yogurt works, I bought
some delightful scented candles.
Look, it's you.
Thank you so much
for opening up your home to me.
Well, who wants to stay in a hotel?
Windows that don't open,
those crazy card-shaped keys.
I'm so glad you understand.
No, he doesn't understand.
- I understand.
- I understand too.
You're just misappropriating
my understanding.
I think any university would want you.
Except any university
that already had you...
...because they would've
already wanted you...
...before they, you know, got you.
From the mind that brought you hi-lo.
Let me show you to your room.
All right, I guess I am tired.
- Good night, Leonard.
- Sleep night.
I mean, obviously, good night.
I started to say sleep tight.
Then I changed my mind in the middle.
I swear to God, I'm smart.
Get it together, man.
All right, let me show you
some of the features of the room.
First, windows. Conventional.
Open, closed. Open, closed.
Halfway open, or halfway closed...
...depending on
your philosophical bent.
Over here is my comic-book collection.
Feel free to browse.
There's a box of disposable
reading gloves on the nightstand.
Good to know.
In here,
you'll find emergency provisions.
An eight-day supply
of food and water, a crossbow...
...season two of
Star Trek: The Original Series...
...on a high-density flash drive.
What if there's a disaster
that destroys all the USB ports?
Then there's really
no reason to live, is there?
Can I ask you a question
about your roommate?
He's an odd duck, isn't he?
What's his relationship status?
Well, there was
a misbegotten adventure...
...with a waitress
who lives across the hall.
It ended as inexplicably as it began.
They had very little in common
except for carnal activity.
That's why I acquired
these noise-canceling headphones.
If you decide to use them,
please clean the earpieces afterwards...
...with the Wet Wipes
you'll find in the bathroom.
They're in the drawer
labeled "Wet Wipes."
- Okay.
- Good.
I'll leave you
to your nighttime ablutions.
I've e-mailed you
the morning bathroom schedule.
You'll also find a laminated copy
in your welcome packet.
On the back of
the emergency-escape-route diagram.
How thoughtful.
- Sleep well, my friend.
- You too.
Let me just get one thing.
It's my backup emergency supply kit.
The living-room escape route
doesn't pass through here.
Now, good night.
And if there's an apocalypse,
good luck.
Yes?
- I saw your light on.
- Is everything all right?
Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.
Me neither.
Look what I'm reading.
It's you.
- I thought you already read it.
- I did.
But it's been a while, and I wanted
to sound smart over breakfast.
Aw, you're smart.
Oh, good. I wasn't sure
it was coming across.
What chapter are you on?
Uh, six.
Ah. The extragalactic distance ladder.
- Want to know a little secret?
- Sure.
I wrote the section on the
Wilson-Bappu Effect completely naked.
Really?
Sure doesn't read that way.
Here, let me show you.
When we consider the brightness
of pulsating variable stars...
...we start to see
a possible explanation...
...for some of the discrepancies
found in Hubble's constant.
Wow.
You really make science come alive.
Vocal test.
Morning vocal test.
Second vocal test.
Second morning vocal test.
- Morning, Sheldon.
- Morning.
- Morning, Sheldon.
- Morning.
- I trust you had a pleasant night?
- More than pleasant.
Excuse me.
I'm going to relieve myself.
- How do you take your coffee?
- Black.
Okeydoke.
Pee for Houston. Pee for Austin.
Pee for the state my heart got lost in.
And shake twice for Texas.
Something his mother taught him.
All right.
Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours.
The seat is down and has been
sanitized for your protection.
That's very thoughtful,
but I think I'll finish my coffee first.
Ah, so the yogurt didn't work.
I'll fire off a critical e-mail
to the manufacturer.
Oh, good, you're up.
My car won't start.
I need a ride to work.
Did you ignore
your check-engine light?
No, Mr. Smarty-pants.
I ignored the fill-gas-tank light.
Leonard, Penny wants to exploit
any feelings you have for her...
...in order to get a ride to work.
Oh, uh, sure, let me just put this
in a travel mug.
- Hello?
- Hi.
Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton,
a leading expert on quantum cosmology.
Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress
who doesn't understand...
...the role gasoline plays
in the internal combustion engine.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.
- Are you enjoying your stay?
- Yes, very much.
Good.
Wonderful. Meaningless
pleasantries accomplished.
Elizabeth, Leonard's bathroom time
is coming up...
...and, believe me,
you do not want to follow him.
Excuse me.
Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed
so I can take everyone to work.
You and Sheldon and Sheldon's friend,
Dr. Plimpton, who you just met.
It'll be fun.
Like a clown car. Heh, heh.
- Hang on.
- Hm, yeah? What? Huh?
We just broke up.
You and me? Yeah, we did.
Not too long ago.
How are you doing with it?
Not as good as you, apparently.
I don't follow.
You know, it's none of my business.
You wanna sleep with Sheldon's buddy
right after we broke up, go for it.
- Well, now...
- Excuse me.
I'm uncomfortable
with you recommending...
...Leonard pursue intercourse
with Dr. Plimpton.
Who, I assure you,
has better things to do.
I'm not recommending it.
I'm saying it already happened.
Oh, that's preposterous.
Tell her, Leonard.
Well...
No.
Oh, come on. It wasn't my fault.
The implication being that you somehow
tripped and fell into her lady parts?
I'm just gonna take the bus to work.
- Penny, I can still drive you.
- No, no, it's okay.
You might slip on a banana peel
and get me pregnant.
I must say,
I'm shocked by this betrayal.
I didn't betray Penny.
Not Penny, me.
How am I betraying you?
Elizabeth's my friend,
and you're playing with her.
Yeah, I guess I did.
What the hell are you doing?
Relax, it's Nyquil.
- You still have a cold?
- Maybe, but I don't care.
That's the great thing about Nyquil,
it's like 10 percent booze.
I call it the nighttime
sniffling, sneezing, coughing...
...so-you-can-talk-to-girls medicine.
Are you having trouble sleeping?
Because, boy, I was up all night.
Did you get a cold too?
No, I was awake all night.
If you want, I can give you
some of my mom's sleeping pills.
- She won't notice they're missing?
- She doesn't know she takes them.
No, that's okay. It was something else
keeping me up last night.
And again this morning.
And I didn't mind.
I was up last night.
I was up this morning. I didn't mind.
Those are your clues.
Ooh, ooh, did the pigeon
on your window sill have more babies?
- No.
- Were you making another Lego movie?
- No.
- Because let me tell you:
It's not enough to make the Legos move.
They also have to capture your heart.
Okay, I'll give you one more clue.
It involved another person.
Did you get a Japanese love pillow?
How is a Japanese love pillow
another person?
It is if you love her
and give her a name.
Dr. Plimpton,
I'd like you to meet my colleagues.
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.
- And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.
- Hi.
- I'm a big fan of your work.
- Thank you.
And, of course, you've already
introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter.
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.
Boy, I'm kind of tuckered out.
How are you feeling, Elizabeth?
You know what? I am a little tired.
Would you be a dear
and get me a cup of coffee?
Sure. Black, right?
Actually, now I think I want it
hot, brown and sweet.
Coming right up.
What?
What do you mean, "what?"
It's "Halo" night.
I can't. I'm too sick.
Go away.
That's why we moved
"Halo" night here.
I brought my mom's chicken soup.
I'm not hungry.
Don't send him away. Let him in.
- Who is that?
- I bought a parrot.
Yeah, right.
- Dr. Plimpton?
- Hi.
- Howard, right?
- Uh, yeah.
Can I ask you a question, Howard?
Do you like role-playing games?
Yeah, sure. Heh.
In fact, I'm a dungeon master.
Not tonight.
Tonight, you are a deliveryman.
You've brought soup but, uh-oh, Raj and I
don't have enough money to pay you.
So we'll have to come
to some other kind of arrangement.
Beg pardon?
You figure out the details.
I'm gonna change into something...
...I don't mind getting ripped off
my milky flesh.
What the frak?
Go away.
She wants New Delhi, not kosher deli.
Besides, you have a girlfriend.
We broke up weeks ago.
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I was waiting for the right time.
This is the right time.
Hey, who's ready for "Halo"?
Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost.
The numbers
are shaky enough as it is.
I don't understand.
Oh, good. Leonard's here.
Good?
Elizabeth? What's going on?
What's going on is you and Howard
are my moving men.
And Raj is my new landlord.
And I don't have enough money
to pay any of you.
Is she suggesting
what I think she's suggesting?
Yup. Welcome to
the Renthouse Forum.
Okay, show of hands.
Who's up for this?
We'll all be naked
in front of each other.
I'm out.
Everybody ready?
Follow my lead. Almost.
We're going to go out into the hallway
and make a dramatic entrance.
Oh, good. It's so much better
when everyone commits.
Run, run, run. Don't look back.
I thought we had something special.
So you say you can't pay your rent?
- Oh, Leonard?
- Hey.
I found these in the dryer.
I'm assuming they belong to Sheldon.
Thanks. It's really hard
to find these in his size.
So listen.
I've been meaning to talk to you
about the other morning.
You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?
Yeah, I wanted to explain.
No. You don't owe me an explanation.
- I don't?
- No, you don't.
So you're not judging me?
Oh, I'm judging you
nine ways to Sunday...
...but you don't owe me
an explanation.
Nevertheless, I'd like to get one
on the record...
...so you can understand
why I did what I did.
I'm listening.
She let me.
