Worst Renaissance fair ever.
Please let it go, Sheldon.
SHELDON:
It was rife with historical inaccuracies.
For example, the tavern girl
serving flagons of mead.
Now, her costume
was obviously Germanic...
...but in 1487, the Bavarian purity laws,
or Reinheitsgebot...
...severely limited the availability
of mead.
At best,
they would've had some spiced wine.
LEONARD: You're nitpicking.
SHELDON: Oh, really?
Well, here's another nit for you.
The flagons would not have been made
of polypropylene.
Renaissance fairs
aren't about historical accuracy.
They're about taking chubby girls
who work at Kinko's...
...and lacing them up
in corsets so tight...
...their bosom jumps out
and says, "Howdy."
Bosoms would not have said, "Howdy,"
in the 15th century.
If anything,
they would've said, "Huzzah."
I don't care what the bosoms say,
Sheldon.
I just wanna be part of the conversation.
Hi, guys.
Looks like you've been
to the Renaissance fair.
I'm hoping.
Renaissance fair?
More of a medieval-slash-
Age of Enlightenment...
...slash-
any-excuse-to-wear-a-codpiece fair.
Okay, fine, whatever.
Um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.
- Hello.
ERIC: Hey.
So, yeah, good to see you.
Yeah. Yeah, it's good to see you too.
- We should probably go.
- Yeah.
- Bye, guys.
- Like your hat.
Thanks, my mom made it.
Penny with a new guy. Très awkward.
It wasn't awkward.
It wasn't fun.
Besides, what's the big deal?
We dated, we stopped dating,
and now we're both moving on.
By "moving on," you mean
she's going out with other men...
...and you spend the afternoon
making 15th-century soap with Wolowitz?
That was not 15th-century soap.
My god, those people need to learn
you can't just put "ye olde" ...
...in front of anything you want
and expect to get away with it.
Can we please just go in?
My chain mail's stuck in my underwear.
You're wearing modern underwear?
Relatively modern.
What are you wearing?
I fashioned historically accurate
undergarments out of linen.
You went and bought linen?
Don't be silly.
I borrowed one of your pillowcases.
Borrowed?
You know,
I'm happy that Penny's moving on.
It gives me freedom to move on myself.
Are you saying
that you've been holding back?
Of course. Out of respect.
So how do you explain
the 10 years before Penny?
Who were you respecting then?
What? I've dated plenty of women.
There was, uh, Joyce Kim,
Leslie Winkle....
Notify the editors
of the Oxford English Dictionary:
The word "plenty"
has been redefined to mean "two."
What about that girl last year
at Comic-Con?
- It doesn't count.
- Why not?
What happens in costume at Comic-Con
stays at Comic-Con.
You're only saying that
because of what happened.
- What happened to you?
- Nothing happened to me.
It wasn't your fault, Raj.
He was dressed
as a green Orion slave girl.
How did we get on me?
We were mocking Leonard.
- Dude, you have totally not moved on.
- Yes, I have.
It's just a matter
of actually making a date with someone.
- Like who?
- Well, there's Joyce Kim.
But she defected back to North Korea...
...so it's a little
geographically undesirable.
- What about Leslie Winkle?
- Oh, no.
- Why?
- Her research methodology is sloppy...
...she's unjustifiably arrogant
about loop quantum gravity...
...and to make matters worse,
she's often mean to me.
- I think she's smoking hot.
- I'd hit that.
You'd hit particulate soil
in a colloidal suspension.
Mud.
Look, I like Leslie,
but she's not interested in dating...
...as much as using men as tools
for stress release.
Yeah? So? Be a tool.
Go get yourself
a little rebound stress release.
It would only be rebound if he and Penny
had actually engaged in physical intimacy.
You mean like you
and Richard the slave girl?
I bought him dinner and we kissed once.
That was it.
And he told me his name was Kimberly.
You know how I know
we're not in the Matrix?
How?
If we were, the food would be better.
Hey, Leonard.
- Hey, Leslie.
- Hey, dummy.
Hello to you,
insufficiently intelligent person.
Ooh, rush me to the Burn Unit.
Do you have a second?
I need to ask you something.
- Yeah, sure.
- Well, if you'll excuse me...
...l'm going to go do work
that promises significant results...
...as opposed to what you do,
which does not.
Yeah, you heard me.
Wow.
So I heard your relationship with Penny
crashed to the ground...
...like blue ice
falling out of an airplane lavatory.
- Where'd you hear that?
- Actually, I read it. Wolowitz texted me.
"Like blue ice
falling out of an airplane lavatory," yep.
Yeah, I thought it was a pretty good one.
I gave him an "LOL."
Anyway, it got me thinking.
Now that you're unattached, maybe
we can revisit our previous attachment.
Are you suggesting another bout
of stress release?
No, I'm all done with casual sex.
I'm fully committed
to the traditional relationship paradigm.
Really? What changed?
There's just a time
in every woman's life...
...when she gets tired of waking up
on a futon...
...with a bunch of people
she doesn't know.
Yeah, I can see how that would--
A bunch of people?
Anyway, I just figure
it's time to slow things down...
...and who better to slow things down with
than you?
I'm flattered.
So how do you suggest we proceed?
Your place. We'll order Chinese.
You'll rent a movie, artsy but accessible.
Then light petting, no coitus.
- Sounds fun.
- I'll leave the details up to you.
I think it's better
if you assume the male role.
Thank you, that's very thoughtful.
Great.
Call me.
Hey, great news.
My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.
LEONARD:
Oh.
- Terrific.
- You know what this means, don't you?
Break out the Red Bull.
It's time to rock "Mario" old school.
- I kind of have other plans tonight.
- But it's Friday.
Friday's always vintage-game night.
Look, Mom included the memory card.
We can pick up right where I left off
in 1999 when I had pernicious anemia.
The thing is, someone's coming over.
Well, no problem. I have three controllers.
The more the merrier.
Sheldon, it's a date.
I have a date coming over.
Oh.
Well, you can't blame me
for not jumping to that conclusion.
Why? What's so unusual
about me having a date?
- Well, statistically speaking--
- All right, all right.
Nevertheless, I have one now...
...and I'd appreciate it if you would,
you know, make yourself scarce.
I am a published theoretical physicist
with two doctorates...
...and an IQ which can't be measured
by normal tests.
How much scarcer could I be?
You know what I mean.
Could you just give us a little privacy?
- You want me to leave the apartment?
- Yes.
You mean just go someplace else
and be...
...someplace else?
- Yes.
- But why should I leave?
- This is my apartment too.
- I know it is.
If science ever discovers a second member
of your species...
...and you two would like some privacy,
I'd be happy to get out of your way.
Well, all right, then.
Sheldon? What are you doing?
Playing "Super Mario"
on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.
But why are you doing it on the stairs?
I am a modern-day Napoleon
exiled to the Elba of the staircase...
...because Leonard, get this, has a date.
Oh. Oh, well, good for him.
Yeah, but why are you sitting here?
Why don't you go to a movie or something?
Alone?
- Yeah, why not?
- What if I choke on my popcorn?
Who will administer
the Heimlich maneuver?
- Then don't order popcorn.
- No popcorn at the mov--?
Listen to yourself.
- Why don't you go to a coffee shop?
- I don't drink coffee.
They have other things.
- What do they have?
- I don't know. You know, cookies, pastries--
- Pastries such as bear claws?
- Yeah, sure.
I don't like bear claws.
Hey, Penny. Dumb-ass.
Leslie Winkle.
Of all the overrated physicists
in all the labs in all the world...
...why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?
Well, they have a lot in common.
I mean, they're both scientists.
Please. The only way she could make
a contribution to science...
...would be if they resumed sending chimps
into space.
Okay, well, I have a date too,
so I'll see you.
Everybody has a date.
Even you, Mario,
going after Princess Peach.
And what am I doing?
I'm just enabling you.
- This is pretty good orange chicken.
- Yeah, it's from Chang's.
- Not Chow's?
- No, Chang's.
- What happened to Chow's?
- It changed.
So how many children
do you think we should have?
[COUGHING]
I'm sorry, that was a little abrupt.
A little.
There are so many things to talk about
before reproduction.
I sure hope so.
Besides shortness, what genetic
weaknesses run in your family?
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Battery's dying. Continue.
Uh, genetic weaknesses, right.
Um, there's the lactose intolerance.
Don't forget the male-pattern baldness.
When his uncles sit around the dinner table,
they look like a half-carton of eggs.
Okay, yeah, my uncles are bald...
...but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest
women you'll ever meet, so, you know....
Sweet lady.
It always tickles when she hugs me.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
- What now?
- I have to make pee-pee.
I'm sorry
about all of Sheldon's interruptions.
He can be a bit of an eccentric.
If by "eccentric" ...
...you mean "passive-aggressive
East Texas blowhole," I agree.
Well, I think tonight
was a very good start.
Me too. You're sure you're okay
postponing intercourse...
...until our relationship
is past the initial viability test?
No problem.
I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse.
I guess I'll call you
and we'll arrange another evening.
I believe protocol dictates
that you wait a minimum of 18 hours...
...before you call so I'm not repulsed
by your cloying eagerness.
- Sure.
- Again, it's your decision. You're the man.
PENNY:
No, it wasn't my cat.
It was an experiment designed
by this guy named Schrödinger.
From the Charlie Brown cartoons?
No, he was some kind of scientist.
Let me start again.
- Oh, hey, Leonard.
- Hello.
- Leslie.
LESLIE: Hi.
Okay, well, good night.
Okay, well, good night.
That ain't gonna make your point.
Okay, okay, that's enough.
Call me.
Right.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Well, okay, good night.
- What?
- Had a great time. Ciao.
I'm sorry,
I am not going back to the Renaissance fair.
Come on, Sheldon.
There are so few places
I can wear my jester costume.
I don't care. There are far too many
historical anomalies for my comfort.
Oh, okay, how about this?
You can go dressed
as a Star Trek science officer...
...exploring a planet similar to Earth
in the 1500s.
You mean like Spock?
Sure.
Fascinating.
- Hey, fellow scientists. Sheldon.
LEONARD: Mm.
Why don't we move there
so Leslie can join us?
Yeah, let's do it.
If you're having trouble
deciding where to sit...
...I suggest One Potato, Two Potato...
...or as I call it, the Leslie Winkle
Experimental Methodology.
- Don't make this hard for me.
- It's not hard. It's simple.
You can either sit with me,
your friend, colleague and roommate...
...or you can sit with an overrated scientist
you might have sex with.
You're right, it is simple.
- Hey, Sheldon.
SHELDON: Penny.
Third floor tonight. Mixing it up?
Oh.
I still don't understand
why you don't just go to dinner.
All right, let's say I go to dinner alone...
...and during the meal
I have to use the restroom.
How do I know
someone's not touching my food?
Good night, Sheldon.
Penny, hold on.
You sure things can't work out
with you and Leonard?
Excuse me?
I'm just wondering
if you really gave it the old college try.
Or in your case,
the old community-college try.
Okay, where is this coming from?
Leonard is upstairs right now
with my archenemy.
- Your archenemy?
- Yes, the Dr. Doom to my Mr. Fantastic.
The Dr. Octopus to my Spider-Man.
- The Dr. Sivana to my Captain Marvel--
- Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.
It's amazing how many super villains
have advanced degrees.
Graduate schools should do a better job
of screening those people out.
Sheldon, come back. You're losing me.
It's Leslie Winkle, Penny.
She belittles my research.
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
She called me "dumb-ass."
I know, I heard.
Given the situation...
...I have no choice
but to withdraw my previous objections...
...to your ill-considered relationship
with Leonard.
Oh, gee, well, thank you for that.
But, um, I think for now
Leonard and I are just gonna stay friends.
No. That response is unacceptable to me.
- You are a smart guy. You must know--
- I'm smart?
I'd have to lose 60 IQ points
to be classified as "smart."
- Are you gonna let me talk?
- I'm sorry.
You must know that if Leonard and Leslie
wanna be together...
...nothing you can do is gonna stop it.
You continue to underestimate
my capabilities, madam.
Okay, let me put it this way.
If you're Leonard's friend...
...you will support him
no matter who he wants to be with.
Wait a minute.
Why am I doing all the giving here?
If Leonard's really my friend...
...why doesn't he have to support me
in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?
Because love trumps hate.
Oh, now you're just making stuff up.
Okay. Good night, Sheldon.
Oh, Mario.
If only I could control everyone
the way I control you.
Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.
When the two of you reach a natural
stopping point, I'd like to have a word.
If the word is "pee-pee," just do it.
Leonard, you're my friend...
...and friends support their friends,
apparently.
So I am withdrawing my objection...
...to your desire
to have a relationship with Leslie.
- Thank you.
- I will graciously overlook the fact...
...that she is an arrogant,
subpar scientist...
...who believes loop quantum gravity
better unites quantum mechanics...
...with general relativity
than does string theory.
You kids have fun.
Hang on a second.
Loop quantum gravity clearly offers
more testable predictions than string theory.
I'm listening. Amuse me.
Okay, well, for one thing,
we expect quantized space-time...
...to manifest as minute differences
in the speed of light for different colors.
Balderdash.
Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.
Are you gonna let him talk to me
like that?
Okay, well,
there is a lot of merit to both theories.
No, there isn't. Only loop quantum gravity
calculates the entropy of black holes.
[SNORTS]
Sheldon, don't make that noise.
It's disrespectful.
I should hope so.
It was a snort of derision.
You agree with me, right?
Loop quantum gravity
is the future of physics.
Sorry, Leslie,
I guess I prefer my space stringy, not loopy.
Well, I'm glad I found out the truth
about you before this went any further.
Truth? What truth?
We're talking about untested hypotheses--
Look, it's no big deal.
Oh, it isn't? Really?
Tell me, Leonard,
how will we raise the children?
I guess we wait until they're old enough
and let them choose their own theory.
We can't let them choose, Leonard,
they're children.
Wait, where are you going?
I'm sorry.
I could've accepted our kids
being genetically unable to eat ice cream...
...or ever get a good view of a parade.
But this? This is a deal breaker.
Look on the bright side.
- What's the bright side?
- Only nine more months to Comic-Con.
Oh, yeah.
[WHIRRING]
Captain, I'm getting an unusual reading.
Yeah, that's great.
You guys want corn dogs?
Yeah.
That's a temporal anomaly.
Corn dogs didn't come into existence
till the first half of the 20th century.
