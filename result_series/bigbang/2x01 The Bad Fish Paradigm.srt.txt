So, what you're eating
is not technically yogurt.
It doesn't have enough
live acidophilus cultures.
It's really just ice milk
with carrageenan added for thickness.
- Well, that's very interesting.
- It's also not pink and has no berries.
Yeah, but it doesn't really
answer my question.
- What was your question again?
- Do you want some?
Ah.
- Right. No. I'm lactose intolerant.
- Right.
- So gas.
- Yeah, got it.
Well, good night.
- What are you doing?
- There was a draft.
PENNY:
I didn't feel a draft.
- Why don't we just go into your--?
- Oh, yeah.
Maybe we should
slow things down a little.
No, I didn't mean
to go into your apartment to go fast.
No, I know.
I know what you meant.
It's just this is only our first date.
Okay. Sure. No problem.
Why don't we just figure out
where we're going...
...and when we want to get there?
And then rate of speed
equals distance over time.
Solve for R.
Or we could just wing it.
That might work too.
- Good night, Leonard.
- Good night.
He's coming. Screen saver.
Oh, hey, Leonard.
- How was your date?
- Bite me.
Sheldon, how could you just sit there
and let them spy on me?
They were clever.
They exploited my complete lack of interest
in what you were doing.
You should thank us.
When future generations try to determine...
...why your relationship with Penny
crashed and burned...
...this right here is the black box.
What are you talking about?
The date went fine.
She said she wants to slow things down.
Okay, so she said
she wants to slow things down.
It's like saying,
"I'm really enjoying this meal.
I'm going to slow down and savor it."
No, it's like, "This fish tastes bad...
...so I'm gonna slow down
and spit it out."
- You being the fish.
- I'm not the fish.
Oh, really?
Did you make a second date?
- Well, no. We sort of decided to wing it.
- Oh, even I know that's lame.
Okay. All right.
Let's assume your hypothesis.
We went to dinner, we talked,
we laughed, we kissed.
Where could I have gone wrong?
Think back, Leonard.
The littlest things can set women off.
Like, "Hey, the waitress is hot. I bet
we could get her to come home with us."
Or, "How much does your mom weigh?
I wanna know what I'm getting into."
- I didn't say anything like that.
- Good, because they don't work.
They don't care for it
if you stare at them and hyperventilate.
Sadly, that's my home-run swing.
Look, everything went fine.
I didn't even have to refer
to my impromptu conversation starters.
That woman across the hall is into me.
Let's go to the tape.
Look at her reaction
to the good-night kiss.
No change in respiration, pupils undilated,
no flushing of the chest.
Nice close-up, by the way.
Interesting. Her jaws are clenched.
No tongue access.
Clearly a bad sign
amongst mating humans.
That's not a bad sign.
Please. You might as well have been
two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.
And the worst sign of all
is you're here and not there.
I'm not there,
because I'm taking things slow.
Which, by the way, compared to you guys,
approaches warp speed.
And take down that camera.
He was a lot more fun
when he had no hope.
Give him time.
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Penny.
Yeah, FYI, the hot water is inadequate
on Machine 2, so colors only.
Four is still releasing the fabric softener
too early in the cycle.
- So I'd avoid using that for your delicates.
- Thanks.
Well, good Lord.
Why don't you just take your clothes down
to the river and beat them with a rock?
Sheldon, may I ask you a question?
I would prefer that you not,
but I won't go so far as to forbid it.
All right, I heard "yes," so....
Okay, here's my question:
Has Leonard ever dated,
you know, a regular girl?
Well, I assume you're not referring
to digestive regularity.
Because I've come to learn
that such inquiries are inappropriate.
No, I meant has he ever been involved
with someone who wasn't a brainiac?
Oh! Well, a few years ago...
...he did go out with a woman
who had a Ph.D. in French literature.
- How is that not a brainiac?
- Well, for one thing, she was French.
For another, it was literature.
So....
Do you think that if Leonard
and I keep dating...
...he'll eventually get bored with me?
- That depends.
- On what?
Do you have a working knowledge
of quantum physics?
No.
Do you speak Klingon?
No.
- You know any card tricks?
- Okay.
I get it. Leonard has no business
being involved with a waitress/actress...
...who felt so insecure, that she lied to him
about finishing community college.
Why would you lie about that?
He was going on about this college
and that grad school...
...and I didn't want him to think
I was some kind of stupid loser.
You thought the opposite of "stupid loser"
was "community-college graduate"?
There are a lot of successful people
in this country...
...who are community-college graduates.
Yeah, but you are neither.
Right. Okay, look,
this is between you and me.
You cannot tell Leonard any of this.
- You're asking me to keep a secret?
- Yeah.
Well, I'm sorry.
You would've had to express that desire
before revealing the secret...
...so that I could choose whether I wanted
to accept the covenant of secret-keeping.
You can't impose a secret
on an ex post facto basis.
What?
Secret-keeping is a complicated endeavor.
One has to be concerned...
...not only about what one says, but about
facial expressions, autonomic reflexes.
When I try to deceive...
...I myself have more nervous tics
than a Lyme disease research facility.
It's a joke.
It relies on the homonymic relationship
between tick, the bloodsucking arachnid...
...and tic, the involuntary
muscular contraction.
[CHUCKLES]
I made it up myself.
Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied,
I will absolutely die of embarrassment.
- Physiologically impossible.
- Oh, Sheldon, please.
Look, I'm asking you as a friend.
You're saying that friendship
contains within it...
...an inherent obligation
to maintain confidences?
- Well, yeah.
- Interesting.
One more question.
Perhaps I should've led with this:
When did we become friends?
I.e., I couldn't become Green Lantern unless
I was chosen by the Guardians of Oa.
Given enough startup capital
and an adequate research facility...
...I could be Batman.
- You could be Batman?
- Sure.
[IN DEEP VOICE]
I'm Batman.
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
See?
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.
- Hi, Penny.
- Hey.
If you're not doing anything Friday night,
I thought we could go see a movie.
You know, I think I have the dinner shift
on Friday.
- Okay. What about Saturday?
- You know, I'm not sure.
The manager hasn't posted the schedule.
How about I let you know?
- Great.
- Okay.
So you just let me know when you know.
Okay, so-- Oh, God, I am the bad fish.
- What did I do wrong?
- Why are you asking me?
I have no information
about your interactions with Penny...
...nor do I have any method
of learning such things.
LEONARD: What does that mean?
- Nothing.
You seem to be implying a back channel
between me and Penny...
- ...where, obviously, none exists.
- No, I didn't.
I just think you need to be careful
how you phrase things, sir.
- What's going on with you?
- Well, I might ask you the same question.
Why do you drag me into matters
which have nothing to do with me...
...but exist between you and Penny,
a person to whom I barely speak?
What's wrong with your face?
There's no reason
to bring my looks into this.
- Good day, Leonard.
- What?
I said, good day.
Good day?
Also today we have
a fresh-caught Alaska salmon...
...served with a teriyaki glaze
and sticky rice.
- Our soup of the day--
- You must release me from my oath.
Sheldon, I'm working.
Why don't you take a minute to decide?
I can't keep your secret, Penny.
I'm going to fold like an energy-based
de novo protein in conformational space.
Like a Renaissance triptych.
Like a cheap suit.
Look, why is it so hard
for you to keep one little secret?
I'm constitutionally incapable.
That's why I was refused clearance
for a government research fellowship...
...at a secret military supercollider
beneath a fake agricultural station...
...12.5 miles southeast
of Traverse City, Michigan.
Which you did not hear about from me.
Look, just forget I told you about me...
...not graduating
from community college, okay?
Forget? You want me to forget?
This mind does not forget.
I haven't forgotten a thing since the day
my mother stopped breastfeeding me.
- It was a drizzly Tuesday.
- Okay.
You promised me
you would keep my secret...
...so you are just gonna have to
figure out a way to do it.
Leonard, I'm moving out.
What do you mean
you're moving out? Why?
There doesn't have to be a reason.
- Yeah, there kind of does.
- Not necessarily.
This is a classic example
of MÃ¼nchausen's trilemma.
Either the reason is predicated on a series
of sub-reasons leading to regression...
...or it tracks back to axiomatic statements,
or it's ultimately circular...
...i.e., I'm moving out
because I'm moving out.
I'm still confused.
Leonard, I don't see
how I could've made it any simpler.
Hey, qu'est-ce que c'up?
We just got back from that exhibit
of those plasticized cadavers.
Some of those skinless chicks were hot.
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to pack.
That's kind of an overreaction
to a little harmless necrophilia.
It's not you, Howard.
He says he's moving out.
What did you do?
Did you change the contrast
or brightness settings on the television?
- No.
- Did you take a Band-Aid off...
...in front of him?
- No.
- Did you buy generic ketchup?
Forget to rinse the sink?
Talk to him through the bathroom door?
Adjust the thermostat? Cook with cilantro?
Pronounce the T in "often"?
No.
Did you make fun of trains?
I didn't do anything.
He's just gone insane.
Well, we all knew this day was coming.
That was fast.
It's my pre-packed
disaster evacuation bag.
It's recommended by
the Department of Homeland Security.
And Sarah Connor.
Where are you gonna live?
Until I find a permanent place,
I will stay with friends.
Bye.
Well-- But you can't stay with me.
I have a teeny-tiny apartment.
Excuse me, but isn't hosting guests
an aspect of manushya yajna...
...one of the five central religious duties
or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?
I hate trains.
Don't be ridiculous. You love trains.
Yes, I do. Come on.
See you later, Leonard.
This could work.
[INDIAN MUSIC PLAYING
ON TELEVISION]
- This is a very old building.
- Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory.
- Uh-oh.
- What?
Don't you worry about the residual radium
from the luminous dials?
Not until now.
I can't believe
I didn't bring my Geiger counter.
Yeah, I had it on my bed,
and I didn't pack it.
- lf you're not comfortable staying here--
- I'm kidding. I packed it.
It was a joke. Yeah, I was subverting
the conversational expectations.
I believe they call that
the old switcheroo.
Terrific.
- Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?
- Yes. Isn't she an amazing actress?
Actually, I'd say
she's a poor man's Madhuri Dixit.
How dare you?
Aishwarya Rai is a goddess.
By comparison, Madhuri Dixit
is a leprous prostitute.
Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.
Obviously, you're not that familiar
with Indian cinema.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Who is it?
RAJESH [IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]:
Stripper-gram.
Tag. You're it.
Shouldn't you have put him
in a brown paper bag and set him on fire?
I've never slept on an air mattress before.
No lumbar support whatsoever.
Maybe you'd be happier on a park bench.
I don't see any way
to get a park bench in here.
- Do you wanna switch?
- No. That's fine.
I'm perfectly comfortable
sleeping on a bouncy castle.
- Get out of bed. We're switching.
- Now, only if you want to.
Just get in the bed.
MRS. WOLOWITZ: What's going on?
Are you boys roughhousing?
We're just talking, Ma.
If you don't settle down right now...
...l'm not gonna let you
have any more sleepovers.
For God's sake, Ma, I'm 27 years old.
And it's not even a school night!
- Comfy now?
- Eh....
That poster of Halle Berry
is a little unnerving.
So don't look at it.
- She's like my fourth favorite Catwoman.
- No kidding?
Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfeiffer,
Eartha Kitt and then her.
- What about Lee Meriwether?
- Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether.
Well, I'm glad that's settled.
That makes Halle Berry
my fifth favorite Catwoman.
Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfeiffer,
Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether--
- Please, I'm begging you, go to sleep.
- I'm trying. I'm counting Catwomen.
She did make a fine mutant
in the X-Men movies, though.
Oh, for God's sake.
She's not my favorite of the X-Men.
In order, that'd be Wolverine, Cyclops--
I forgot Professor X.
Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman...
...then Storm, Angel, the Bea--
No, wait, Nightcrawler.
Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine,
Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel....
[DOOR KNOCKS]
LEONARD:
I'm coming.
Hey.
There he is.
There's my old buddy-bud-bud.
- What's with him?
- Koothrappali dumped him on me.
He couldn't get to sleep,
so I gave him a glass of milk...
...with a handful
of my mom's Valium in it.
But he still wouldn't shut up,
so tag, you're it.
I'm back.
- I still don't know why you left.
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?
- I promised Penny.
- Promised Penny what?
- That I wouldn't tell you the secret.
Shh!
What secret? Tell me the secret.
Mom smokes in the car.
Jesus is okay with it,
but we can't tell Dad.
Not that secret, the other secret.
- [IN DEEP VOICE] I'm Batman.
- Damn it, Sheldon.
You said Penny told you a secret.
What's the secret?
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Okay, I'll tell you,
but you can't tell Leonard.
I promise.
Penny lied about graduating
from community college...
...because she's afraid
she's not smart enough for Leonard.
So it's nothing I did? It's her problem?
I drank milk that tasted funny.
Penny thinks I'm too smart for her.
That's ridiculous.
I know.
Most of your work is extremely derivative.
And don't worry, that's not a secret.
Everybody knows.
- Hi.
- Yeah, hi. Listen.
I know what's been bothering you about us,
and I have the answer.
- What are you talking about?
- I wanna say that it's not Sheldon's fault.
He tried very hard to keep your secret.
If Howard hadn't drugged him,
he would've taken it to his grave.
- He told you?
- Yes, but it's okay.
Now that we know what the problem is,
there's a simple solution.
- Pasadena City College?
- A place for fun, a place for knowledge.
See, this man here is playing Hacky Sack,
and this girl's gonna be a paralegal.
Oh. I get it,
because Dr. Leonard Hofstadter...
...can't date a girl
without a fancy college degree.
Well, it's really not that fancy.
It's just a city college.
Right, but I have to have
some sort of degree to date you?
- That doesn't matter to me at all.
- So it's fine with you if I'm not smart?
Absolutely.
Okay, this time,
I know where I went wrong.
Bite me.
