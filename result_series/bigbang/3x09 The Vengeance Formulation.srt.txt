So two years later,
there's a knock on the door.
Guy opens it, and there is the snail...
...who says,
"What the heck was all that about?"
I don't really get it.
Well, see, it took two years
for the snail to...
Not important.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.
Where do you think this is going?
To be honest,
I was hoping at least second base.
You're so funny.
You're like a standup comedian.
A Jewish standup comedian,
that would be new.
Actually, I think a lot of them
are Jewish.
No, I was just... Because... Never mind.
Look, Howard, this is our third date,
and we both know what that means.
- We do?
- Sex.
You're kidding.
But I need to know whether
you're looking for a relationship...
...or a one-night stand.
Okay, just to be clear,
there's only one correct answer, right?
I mean, it's not like "Chicken or fish?"
on an airplane?
Maybe you need to think about it
a little.
Well, you know, it's not unheard of...
...for a one-night stand
to turn into a relationship.
Call me when you figure it out.
Three dates means sex?
Who knew?
Greetings, homeys.
Homette.
Why are you back from your date
so early?
Well, in romance, as in show business,
always leave them wanting more.
- What exactly does that mean?
- He struck out.
Hey, did you know
that three dates with the same woman...
...is the threshold for sex?
Actually, I've never had three dates
with the same woman.
With Penny and me, it took two years.
But now that I think about it,
that was three dates.
Okay, well,
before you and Penny hooked up...
...did she ask
for any kind of commitment?
No, she was pretty clear
about wanting to keep her options open.
I have something to announce,
but out of respect for convention...
...I will wait for you
to finish your conversation.
What are you talking about?
The cultural paradigm in which
people have sex after three dates.
I see.
Now, are we talking "date"
the social interaction...
...or "date" the dried fruit?
Never mind.
What's your announcement?
Oh, good, my turn.
Well, this is very exciting, and I wanted
you to be among the first to know...
I hear you're gonna be on the radio...
...with Ira Flatow from Science Friday
next week.
Thank you, Kripke...
...for depriving me of the opportunity
to share my news with my friends.
My pleasure.
- My thank-you was not sincere.
- But my pleasure is.
Let me ask you a question.
At what point
did National Public Radio...
...have to start scraping the bottom
of the barrel for its guests?
Eeh-eeh. Don't answer. It's rhetorical.
Well, why are you such a stupidhead?
That is also rhetorical.
I'm sorry you had to hear that.
Are you really gonna be on NPR?
Yes, they're interviewing me by phone
from my office...
...regarding the recent so-called discovery
of magnetic monopoles in spin ices.
It's pledge week, and they're trying
to goose the ratings with controversy.
- Very cool. Congratulations.
- Thank you. My mother is very excited.
She's convening her Bible study group
to listen in...
...and then pray for my soul.
I was on the radio once.
I called into Fever 104 FM New Delhi...
...and was the fourth person
to say the phrase that pays:
"Fever 104:"
That means "Fever 104:
Home of the really good current music."
It's much catchier in Hindi.
All right, these are the talking points
for my NPR interview tomorrow.
I need to make
sure they're simple enough...
...for the less educated in the audience
to understand.
Howard, look this over
and tell me what's unclear to you.
I have a Master's in engineering from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
It required the completion of 144 units
of grad work and an original thesis.
Yes.
Look this over
and tell me what's unclear to you.
You know, when Sheldon gives you
homework, you don't have to do it.
In fact, it's better if you don't.
Otherwise, the rest of us look bad.
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.
Yo, Raj, talk to me.
I'm sorry, just screwing with you.
Hey, Howard,
why haven't you called Bernadette?
Did she say something?
Said she hasn't heard from you.
I thought you liked her.
I do, you know,
but she wants a commitment...
...and I'm not sure she's my type.
She agreed to go out with you for free.
What more do you need?
Look, Bernadette is really nice.
I just always thought when I finally
settled down into a relationship...
...it would be with someone,
you know, different.
Different how?
Well, you know, more like Megan Fox
from Transformers...
...or Katee Sackhoff
from Battlestar Galactica.
Are you high?
You'd have a better shot with the
three-breasted Martian from Total Recall.
Okay, now you're just being unrealistic.
Anyway, that movie was 20 years ago.
Imagine how saggy
those things would be.
You're gonna throw away a great girl
like Bernadette...
...because you're holding out
for some fantasy?
Hey, just because you settled
doesn't mean I have to.
Excuse me, I'm sitting here.
Hey, I did not settle for Leonard.
I mean, obviously, he isn't
the kind of guy I usually go out with.
You know, physically.
Again, I'm right here.
I do not judge a book by its cover.
I am interested in the person underneath.
I am here, right? You see me?
Hey, I'm interested
in what's inside people too.
But, you know, why is it wrong
to want those insides wrapped up...
...in, say, the delicious caramel
that is Halle Berry?
Yes, you're delicious caramel too.
I will tell you why it's wrong...
- Excuse me, may I interject?
- What?
Biologically speaking,
Howard is perfectly justified...
...in seeking out the optimum mate
for the propagation of his genetic line.
Thank you, Sheldon.
Whether that propagation
is in the interest of humanity...
...is an entirely different question.
This is Ira Flatow and
you're listening to NPR's Science Friday.
Joining us today by phone
from his office In Pasadena, California...
...Is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
Oh, this is gonna be a riot.
Thanks for being with us today,
Dr. Cooper.
My pleasure, Ira.
Now, let's talk
about magnetic monopoles.
Can you explain to our audience
just what a monopole Is?
Of course.
First, consider an ordinary magnet,
which has, as even the most uneducated...
...in your audience must know, two poles...
...a north and south pole.
If you cut that in half,
you have two smaller magnets...
...each with its own north
and south pole.
Dr. Cooper, I think there might be
something wrong with our connection.
No, I hear you fine.
As I was saying,
an ordinary magnet has two poles.
The primary characteristic
of a monopole...
...is that it has only one pole,
hence, "monopole."
A requirement for string theory,
or M-theory, If you will...
...is the existence of such monopoles.
I myself led an expedition to the
Arctic Circle In search of said particles.
Kripke, I found the nozzle.
I'm going to kill you.
So nice you could join me this evening.
You're looking lovely as always.
Thanks, Howard.
Always nice to be part
of your masturbatory fantasies.
Come on, Katee,
don't make it sound so cheap.
I'm sorry. Fiddling with yourself
in the bathtub is a real class act.
Thank you.
So, ahem, shall we get started?
Sure, but can I ask you
a question first?
You wanna play Cylon and colonist?
No, I wanna know why
you're playing make-believe with me...
...when you could be out
with a real woman tonight.
- You mean Bernadette?
- No, I mean Princess Leia.
Of course I mean Bernadette.
She's a wonderful girl
and she really likes you.
- I know, but she's not you.
- I'm not me.
The real me is in Beverly Hills
with a tall, handsome rich guy.
- Really? Tall?
- Six-four.
Ouch.
You've got a wonderful girl in your life,
and you're ignoring her...
...to spend your nights in the bathtub
with a mental image and a washcloth.
Howard!
What are you doing in there?
I'm taking a bath!
I hope that's all you're doing!
We share that tub!
Don't remind me!
Oh, man.
All soaped up and no place to go.
How you doing, buddy?
I was humiliated on national radio.
How do you think I'm doing?
Come on, it wasn't that bad.
What do you want?
We represent
the Lollipop Guild, and we want you.
- Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.
- It wasn't funny.
I thought it was funny.
- Raj.
- You laughed.
Did you laugh?
I fell on the floor.
All right, he got you.
You can get him back.
- I refuse to sink to his level.
- You can't sink.
With all that helium in you,
you're lucky you don't float away.
Are you really admitting defeat?
- I never admit defeat.
- Good.
However, on an unrelated topic,
I'm never getting out of this bed again.
What if you could make Kripke
look even sillier than he made you look?
- I don't think that's possible.
- You're not helping.
I didn't come to help. I came to mock.
Sheldon, what you need to do...
...is figure out a way
to exact vengeance on Kripke, like...
Like how the Joker got back at Batman...
...for putting him in the Arkham Asylum
for the Criminally Insane.
He didn't stay and talk about his feelings
with the other villains.
He broke out
and poisoned Gotham's water supply.
Well...
...I suppose I could poison Kripke.
- No, no.
- It's a simple matter.
There are several toxic chemicals
that would be untraceable in an autopsy.
Okay, that's the spirit...
...but let's dial it back
to a nonlethal form of vengeance.
Oh.
How about we put a whoopee cushion
on his office chair?
He'll sit down and it'll sound
like he's flatulent even though he's not.
Let's keep thinking.
Oh, gee, you're too late.
Scarlett Johansson
and Wonder Woman were here...
...trolling around
for neurotic little weasels.
I came to talk to Bernadette.
She's working today, right?
- I don't think she wants to see you.
- Why not?
Come on. You hurt her feelings
by not calling her all week.
Plus, I've been kind of talking
some smack about you.
- Hello, Howard.
- Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you.
- I can't. I'm working.
- This will only take a second.
You asked me to think about
where our relationship was going...
...and I did.
Bernadette...
...will you marry me?
Is this more comedy
that I don't understand?
No, I'm serious.
I'm never gonna find another girl
like you...
...who likes me and is, you know, real.
- So this isn't a joke?
- No.
Then you're insane.
I prefer to think of myself as quirky.
Howard, we've only been on three dates.
We haven't even had sex yet.
Fair enough. When's your break?
Wow.
Don't you just hate
when this happens?
Wow.
All right, how's this for revenge?
A solution of hydrogen peroxide
and one of saturated potassium iodide.
- What's this?
- Mountain Dew.
Ah. Refreshing.
Now, we're going to combine these
chemicals with ordinary dish soap...
...creating a little exothermic release
of oxygen.
- Foamy vengeance.
- Yes, exactly.
This is brilliant, Sheldon.
How are we gonna deploy it
in Kripke's office?
Already taken care of. Observe.
This is a live shot of Kripke's lab
via a mini webcam I was able to install...
...thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed
in the night janitor's shirt pocket.
At the same time, I also secured
large quantities of these chemicals...
...above the tiles in the drop ceiling.
Sheldon, you remind me
of a young Lex Luthor.
You flatter me, sir.
- Let me guess, motion sensors?
- Yes.
The reaction will be triggered when
Kripke reaches the center of the room.
Mwa, ha, ha.
I gotta say, I am really impressed.
This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way
to get even.
It may be low-tech...
...but I still maintain
the whoopee cushion has comic validity.
Here comes Kripke.
Who's that with him?
I believe that's the president
of the university.
- The board of directors. Abort! Abort!
- There is no abort.
- How could you not put in an abort?
- I made a boo-boo, all right?
I think the board will really appreciate
how well we're using that NSA grant.
Right here
we have a micro-controlled plasma...
Wow.
Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.
At least they don't know it was you.
Hello, Kripke.
This classic prank comes to you...
...from the malevolent mind
of Sheldon Cooper.
If you'd like to see the look
on your stupid face...
...this video is being Instantly uploaded
to YouTube.
Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter
and Raj Koothrappali...
...for their support and encouragement
In this enterprise.
Well, I'm going back to India.
What's your plan?
- Hey, here's your tip from Table 7.
- Oh, thanks.
- Mm-hm.
- Testing. Check. Check two.
Oh, now what?
- You want me to throw him out?
- No, that's okay.
Are you sure? He's small.
Bet I could get a nice tight spiral
on him.
I wanna dedicate this number
to a great gal who I've done wrong.
Bernadette
I am so sorry
For trying to propose to you
Bernadette
You found It creepy
But that's just the kind of thing I do
Ahhh
I know now It was too soon
To talk of love
It was just a crazy idea
That came to me In my tub
But, Bernadette
Give me one more chance
Sweet Bernadette
I'll get the hang of this thing
They call romance
Sweet Bernadette
I dream to once again
Kiss your lips
Sweet Bernadette
Sincerely yours, Howard Wolowitz
Bernadette
Oh, I am so sorry.
Are you kidding?
That's the most romantic thing
anyone's ever done for me.
Bernadette
Thank you, Cheesecake Factory.
