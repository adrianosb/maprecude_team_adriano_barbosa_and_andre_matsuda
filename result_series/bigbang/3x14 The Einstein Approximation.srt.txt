What you doing?
Attempting to view work
as a peripheral image...
...so as to engage
the superior colliculus of my brain.
Interesting. I usually just have coffee.
- You've been up all night?
- Is it morning?
- Yes.
- Then I've been up all night.
And you're stuck?
Why else would a person try to engage
their superior colliculus?
Uh, sorry, sweetie.
I can't help you till I've had my coffee.
If you don't put him in his crate at night,
he just runs around the apartment.
What is he doing now?
Mm, he's either isolating the terms
of his formula...
...and examining them individually...
...or looking for the alligator
that swallowed his hand...
...after Peter Pan cut it off.
Captain Hook's hand was eaten
by a crocodile, not an alligator.
If you're going to mock me,
at least get your facts straight.
Aye, aye, captain.
I can't see it.
It just won't coalesce.
Maybe you need a fresh start.
You're right.
Great idea, Leonard. Thank you.
Electrons move through graphene,
act as if they have no mass.
How long has he been stuck?
Mm, intellectually, about 30 hours.
Emotionally, about 29 years.
Unit cell contains two carbon atoms.
Interior angle of a hexagon
is 120 degrees.
Have you tried rebooting him?
No. I think it's a firmware problem.
Hey, it's disco night
at the Moonlight Roller Rink tonight.
Who's up for getting down?
Oh, that's perfect.
Bernadette's been hawking me
to take her roller skating.
Penny likes to skate.
The four of us could double.
We're in.
Great. It's not like I brought it up
because I wanted to go.
- You can come with us.
- No. I don't have to go.
I'm happy just to guide you
to suitable entertainment choices.
I'm a walking, brown yelp.com.
Structure, constant structure.
One atom.
Boy, he's really gone, isn't he?
Yeah. This morning he used
a stick of butter as deodorant.
I thought I smelled popcorn.
The same as fermions.
Travels on a pathway.
Hexagonal. Always hexagonal.
I haven't seen him this stuck since he
tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.
Hey. Those are my lima beans.
Not lima beans. Carbon atoms.
But if I don't eat my lima beans,
I can't have my cookie.
Here. You want my peas?
Peas. Perfect. They can be electrons.
You want my corn?
Don't be ridiculous.
What would I do with corn?
Roller skating.
Shall we grab a bite to eat first?
Good. P.F. Chang's?
My mom has coupons.
Oh, great.
- Your mom is not coming, right?
- Not this time. I promise.
Just to be clear,
roller-skating was my idea.
I'm unhappy
that you turned it into a date...
...and I hope you both fall on your asses
and break your coccyxes.
The plural of "coccyx" is "coccyges."
Screw you.
Give me back my lima beans.
Oh, my God.
Have you ever been so embarrassed?
Not recently.
I don't know which was lamer,
their roller skating or their disco dancing.
For me, the worst part was when
people saw us leave with them.
You had some nice moves out there,
Howard.
- Thanks. You too.
- You noticed all the people looking at us?
Not really. I was in my boogie zone.
- And when Howard tried to do the splits?
- Shh.
Sorry, I'm moving slow.
- I think I bruised my coccyx.
- Aw, poor baby.
Don't tell Koothrappali.
- After you.
- Oh. What a gentleman.
Hey, Sheldon.
Oh, my God, are you...? Whoa!
Good Lord! You're ruining everything!
- Oh, damn.
- Are you okay?
Do I look okay?
Don't bark at me. I fell too.
You've been falling all night.
You're used to it.
Sheldon, what are you doing?
The same thing I've been doing.
Trying to figure out why electrons
have no mass...
- ...when traveling through graphene.
- With marbles?
I needed something bigger
than peas, now, didn't I?
Sheldon, when was the last time
you got any sleep?
Two, three days.
Not important. I don't need sleep.
I need answers.
I need to determine where
in this swamp of unbalanced formulas...
...squateth the toad of truth.
The toad of truth?
Is that a physics thing?
No. That's a crazy thing.
Okay, Sheldon.
What happens to our neuroreceptors
when we don't get enough REM sleep?
They lose their sensitivity to serotonin
and norepinephrine.
Which leads to...
Impaired cognitive function.
Right. So march in there,
brush your teeth and go to bed.
But I don't wanna go to bed.
I'm gonna count to three. One...
Oh, all right.
That was amazing
how you handled him.
I know how to deal
with stubborn children.
My mother used to run an illegal
daycare center in our basement.
Leonard. You're giggling in your sleep.
It's not me. It's my new ring tone.
The Joker. From Batman.
Well, it creeps me out.
Me too. But I paid 3 bucks for it.
Well, just answer the phone.
Hello?
Yeah, I'm Leonard Hofstadter.
Yeah. He's my roommate.
Oh. Is he okay?
All right. I'll be right there.
What happened?
Sheldon's escaped
and is terrorizing the village.
Okay, have fun.
Hi. I'm Dr. Hofstadter.
- Where is he?
- Ball pit.
- Thanks for not calling the cops.
- Oh, it's no big deal.
My sister's got a kid who's special.
Yeah, well, he's extra special.
Hey, Shelly.
What you doing?
Size ratio was all wrong.
Couldn't visualize it.
Needed bigger carbon atoms.
Sure, sure.
How did you get into this place?
Back door has a five-pin tumbler system,
single circuit alarm. Child's play.
You can start sorting
protons and neutrons...
...while I build carbon atoms.
No, I don't think so.
We need to go home now.
But I'm still working.
If you don't come out of there,
I'm gonna have to drag you out.
You can try...
...but you'll never catch me.
For God sakes.
Sheldon, come here!
Buzzinga.
Buzzinga.
Buzzinga.
Buzzinga.
Buzzinga.
Leonard and Penny.
- Leonard and Penny.
- Aah!
What? What, what, what?
Leonard and Penny.
- What?
- I have good news.
And you had to barge in
and wake us up...
- ...in the middle of the night?
- Your cell phone was off.
Because we didn't
wanna be disturbed.
That didn't work out, did it?
Sheldon, what do you want?
I came to tell you I've got the answer.
Really?
You figured out
the graphene problem?
No, I'm still hopelessly stuck on that.
But I figured out how to figure it out.
I know I said I could handle
your roommate, but I was wrong.
We have to break up.
What are you talking about?
- Ahem.
- Oh.
Einstein.
Yeah. I'm gonna need a little more.
Albert Einstein.
Keep going.
When Einstein came up
with special relativity...
...he was working
at the patent office.
So you're gonna go work
at the patent office?
Oh, don't be absurd.
That's in Washington.
I could never live in a city
whose streets are laid out...
...in a wheel-and-spoke pattern.
No. I'm going to find
a similarly menial job...
...where my basal ganglia are occupied
with a routine task...
...freeing my prefrontal cortex
to work quietly in the background.
A great plan.
Of course. Even talking to you
is sufficiently menial.
I can feel the proverbial juices
starting to flow.
Okay.
Well, thanks for sharing with us.
- Good night.
- You're welcome.
Good night to you too.
Oh. By the way, I was watching you sleep
for a moment.
I noticed your snoring seems to be worse
when you're on your back.
No. Leonard doesn't snore.
No. I wasn't talking to Leonard.
Told you.
So, Mr. Cooper,
you're looking for a job.
A menial job.
Like yours.
Why, thank you for noticing.
I'm menial employee of the month.
Do you have a particular field in mind?
I do. For thousands of years...
...the lowest classes of the human race
have spent their lives laboring...
...to erect monuments
under the lash of betters.
Until finally they dropped down
and became one with the dust...
...through which they trudged.
Do you have anything like that?
- No.
- Shouldn't you check your database?
No.
You didn't really type.
I didn't really have to.
So how about construction?
Oh, that would be good.
Yeah, sawing, hammering,
eating out of a lunch pail...
...as my working-class fellows and I
sit perched precariously on a girder...
...high above the metropolis.
No, no. This is putting up sheetrock
at a housing project in Rosemead.
- I could do that.
- Good.
- One question.
- Yes?
What's sheetrock?
Moving on.
How about doing deliveries
for a florist?
That seems acceptable.
- Do you have your own car?
- I don't drive.
Of course you don't.
Mr. Cooper,
let me just ask you a question.
What was your last job?
Senior theoretical particle physicist
at CaITech, focusing on M Theory.
Or in layman's terms, string theory.
I see.
Just give me a second.
Security!
Okay.
I'll get those drinks started for you.
Behind you.
Sheldon? What the hell are you doing?
Trying to get these tables cleared.
We're slammed.
No, wait. Wait. No, wait.
What are you doing here?
A reasonable question.
I asked myself:
"What is the most mind-numbing,
pedestrian job conceivable?"
Three answers came to mind.
A toll booth attendant,
an Apple store genius...
...and what Penny does.
Now, since I don't like touching
other people's coins...
...and I refuse to contribute
to the devaluation of the word "genius"...
...here I am.
You just walked in
and they hired you?
- Just like that?
- Oh, heavens no.
Since I don't need to be paid,
I didn't need to be hired.
I simply came in, picked up a tray
and started working for the man.
Let me get that plate out of your way.
Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
Is it? Just a moment ago,
I had a minor epiphany...
...regarding polymer degradation
phenomenon...
...while scraping congealed nachos
off a plate.
- Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.
- Thanks.
Sheldon, wait. This isn't even what I do.
I'm a waitress, not a busboy.
You're right. That is more menial.
Hello, I'm Sheldon.
I'll be your server today.
I don't recommend the salmon.
I saw it in the kitchen.
All right. One bacon cheeseburger...
...breaking two Jewish
dietary restrictions simultaneously.
Kudos.
And beer-battered fish and chips.
Now, here's your tartar sauce.
I also brought you salsa.
A little unconventional,
but I think you'll like it. It's zingy.
And for you, Factory Burrito Grande,
no cheese, no sour cream...
...no ugly consequences
from your lactose intolerance.
Hang on.
- Black beans, not pinto beans?
- Yes.
- Guacamole? No cilantro? Lettuce?
- Yep.
- Understand why I'm doing this?
- I do.
That'll be all.
That was fun.
How long can he keep this up?
I heard about this professor
who melted down, bought a van...
...spent the rest of his life
as a dog groomer.
Never went back to the university?
Only to shampoo
Professor Shamburg's shih tzu.
Sheesh.
You know, I bet if we all chipped in,
we could buy Sheldon a van.
But he's afraid of dogs.
Yeah. That's the only thing wrong
with that plan.
Hey, guys. Sorry you had to wait,
but we are swamped.
What's this?
Sheldon took our order.
Sheldon doesn't work here.
Well, honey, not to complain...
...but we were starting to think
you didn't either.
Is that really necessary?
Good Lord.
The interference pattern
in the fracture.
The motion of the wave
through the structure.
I've been looking at it all wrong.
I can't consider
the electrons as particles.
They move through the graphene
as a wave.
It's a wave!
The moment to applaud would be now.
Troglodytes.
Sheldon. Where are you going?
Aren't you gonna clean this?
I'm sorry, I don't work here.
- Happy now?
- I'm on a cloud.
Swing me.
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok
And the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me
Sheldon, come here!
Buzzinga.
Buzzinga.
Buzzinga.
Buzzinga.
Buzzinga.
