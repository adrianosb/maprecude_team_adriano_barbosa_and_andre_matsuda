Look at us, getting ready
for a double date with actual women...
...who publicly acknowledge
they're our girlfriends.
Yes. I mean,
actual women are the best.
I don't understand.
What other kind of women are there?
Artificial women are your department.
You wanna take this?
No, it would just freak him out.
Listen, before we leave,
I should warn you...
...I'm a passionate man...
...and I tend towards
public displays of affection.
What are you trying to tell me, Howard?
There might be making out
in the car or restaurant.
I don't want Bernadette
to feel uncomfortable...
...so it would help
if you and Penny made out too.
Don't worry, we're planning to have sex
right on the salad bar.
Namaste, white people.
Good news. I've rented us...
- ...the four-hour edition of Watchmen.
- Got it.
- Seen it.
- Detailed analysis posted online.
Then what are we gonna do tonight?
Sorry. Howard and I are going out
with Penny and Bernadette.
Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights
for me and Leonard.
These broncos have been saddled.
How did we get actual women?
Great. They get girlfriends
and they just abandon us?
It is great, isn't it?
We have a wonderful evening
ahead of us.
- We do?
- Oh, yes.
I discovered I don't have enough room
on my hard drive for a LINUX partition.
You and I are gonna perform
a full backup, reinitialize...
...and then reinstall
all my operating systems.
- I don't wanna do that.
- All right.
Well, I'm going to perform
a full backup, reinitialize...
...and then reinstall
all my operating systems.
Well, what about me?
Well, I understand there are
several types of artificial women.
Maybe you should look into that.
Dude, there are so many cool things
we could be doing tonight. Look.
At the Glendale Galleria:
"Put on your best zoot suit.
It's a salute to swing music...
...in the center court near Macy's,
5 p.m. to 9 p.m."
Huh? Huh?
A salute to zoot.
- Sounds like a hoot.
- I'm sorry, Raj.
I have no desire
to salute any article of clothing tonight...
...much less one that's linked
to race riots in the 1940s.
Race riots?
The Zoot Suit Riots.
Oh.
I always thought that was
some sort of after-Christmas sale.
Why don't we go to the galleria
and walk around?
I don't need anything at the galleria.
You need anything at the galleria?
No, we would just walk around
and see what's what.
That's a semantically null sentence.
Okay, well, how about this?
From the university website:
"Seven p.m. to 10 p.m.,
Norton Hall Multipurpose Room...
...mixer for grad students
and faculty...
...of the Science
and Humanities Departments.
Whether you split atoms or infinitives,
this is the place to be."
Well, that's certainly amusing...
...but I have no interest.
Come on, Sheldon.
The world is filled with people
doing things outside.
Let's go outside. Outside is good.
If outside is so good...
...why has mankind spent thousands
of years trying to perfect inside?
I don't know. It's a marketing scheme.
Please, Sheldon, I'm a young,
virile visitor from a foreign land...
...and I need to strut my stuff.
Let me offer you a compromise.
Sometimes when I feel stifled
and want a change of scenery...
...I use my imagination.
Oh, boy.
One of my favorite places to visit
is the two-dimensional world...
...described in Edwin Abbott's
mathematical fantasy Flatland.
I don't wanna go to Flatland.
You're only saying that
because you haven't been there.
I am now a hexagon
in two-dimensional space...
...and can only perceive the edges
of other objects.
Oy.
Is that you, Raj?
I don't recognize your edge.
Sheldon, I'm begging you.
I want to go to this mixer,
and I don't want to go alone.
Well, you're in luck.
There's a mixer here in Flatland.
Oh, look.
There's a sexually attractive
line segment.
- Chat her up.
- What?
Tell her you're a circle.
Flatland gals are all hot for circles.
I hope you're hungry.
We're going to a terrific restaurant.
Oh, yeah, I'm starved.
When you spend all day in a bio lab...
...watching flesh-eating bacteria
skeletonize rodents...
...it really works up an appetite.
Flesh-eating bacteria
and yet I still wanna kiss this woman.
What does that tell you?
You'd be willing to die a horrible death on
the off chance you'd get to second base.
We're way past second base.
Right, Howard?
Well, we kind of disagree
about what the bases are.
How's your work going, Penny?
Any acting jobs?
The last big thing I did
was this production...
...of Diary of Anne Frank
above a bowling alley.
But I think things
might be turning around pretty soon.
Well, great. How come?
Well, promise you won't
make fun of me?
Of course.
I would never make fun of you.
Okay, well, I went to this psychic
who told me that if I cut my hair...
...I'm gonna get
a national commercial.
What? Seriously?
You're getting career advice
from a psychic?
Good job not making fun of her.
She's not one of those phonies, okay?
She wrote a book, has her own website.
Oh, gee, why didn't you say so?
They don't just let anyone
have a website.
- Why are you being such a jerk?
- You're surprised?
Your psychic didn't tell you
I was going to be a jerk?
Heh, heh. Bite me.
- Come on, Penny.
- Why don't you kids go ahead and chat?
We're gonna make out back here.
I'm sliding into third.
Thanks for coming with me.
Thanks for giving me your limited edition
Green Lantern lantern.
Did you really have to bring it
with you?
What if evil strikes
and my power ring runs low?
- Come on, let's get a drink.
- I don't drink.
Well, I do.
And when my wingman is carrying
a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot.
I'll have a screwdriver, please.
And don't be chintzy with the screw.
I would like a root-beerfloat.
- Sheldon, they don't have ice cream.
- They don't?
Well, apparently these people and I
differ greatly on the definition of "party."
- He'll have a Shirley Temple.
- And don't be chintzy with the Shirley.
- Okay, let's check out the females.
- All right.
There's a female.
That's Professor Wilkinson's wife.
She's like 80.
But she's female. Isn't that the game?
- No. I'm looking for a hookup.
- Oh, yes.
So the point of this exercise is for you
to find someone to copulate with?
Not so loud. But ideally, yes.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
And what is my function as wingman?
- You help me run my game.
- Okay.
And what is your game?
When I lie through my teeth to a woman,
you nod and agree.
Hey, that's pretty cool. What is it?
It's a limited edition
Green Lantern lantern.
My friend is looking for someone
to copulate with.
You're very funny. I'm Abby.
- I'm Sheldon.
- How do you do?
Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.
Call me Raj.
- Hey, Raj. Where are you from?
- The mysterious subcontinent of India.
- Ooh. India.
- You know India?
- I saw Slumdog Millionaire.
- Well, I'm a slumdog astrophysicist.
I thought your father
was a gynecologist.
I'm sorry.
Martha, come here.
Meet Raj and Sheldon.
- My friend Martha.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Is that the limited edition
Green Lantern lantern?
In brightest day, in darkest night,
no evil shall escape my sight.
Oh, that is so awesome.
Thank you.
Have you chosen one
to copulate with?
So, what should we talk about?
Well, we could always learn more...
...about why people who believe
in psychics are idiots. Leonard?
We don't need
to talk about that anymore.
Leonard covered it pretty well
in the car.
I'm sorry, but facts are facts.
Right, and if you can't understand it,
it's not a fact.
No, if it's not a fact, it's not a fact.
- Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me.
- Oh, you're welcome.
- How's your fish?
- Amazing.
- Would you like to try some?
- Yeah, sure.
Well, the fact is you can't.
Howard, Bernadette,
you're both scientists.
Help me out here.
Wanna jump in the middle
of another couple's argument?
- No, thank you.
- Sorry.
Maybe we should just stop talking
about this.
Maybe some of us
should stop talking altogether.
- How is everything tonight?
- Really uncomfortable.
The best thing about a monogamous,
mutually supportive relationship...
...is even if you have different ideas...
...you can have a spirited debate,
yet still care for, even make love...
You want your fish?
Knew you were gonna do that.
Doesn't make me psychic.
Attaboy, Leonard. Make it worse.
American woman
Listen what I say
What's going on?
We scored.
I'm the wingman.
American woman
- Hey.
- Laser.
Had a great night last night.
I don't like to kiss and tell,
but somebody made it to eighth base.
- What the hell is eighth base?
- Seventh base with shirt off.
Well, my shirt.
- How'd things go with Penny?
- Oh, couldn't be better.
Are we taking
our relationship frustrations out...
...on innocent Cylons?
It's not just Cylons. Superman's next.
I was gonna try to squeeze in
a little more mocking before lunch...
...but I can come back when
you don't have a high-powered weapon.
How can I go out with a woman
who believes in psychics?
Hey, I once dated a girl who believed
she was abducted by aliens.
And that didn't bother you?
Au contraire, it meant she was gullible
and open to a little probing.
What am I supposed to do?
Pretend I believe something I don't
when I'm with Penny?
Hey, I'm sure Penny fakes
all kinds of things when she's with you.
Do me a favor.
Lean over, put your head right here.
Let me show you another way
to look at this.
Here we have the universe
of all women.
Okay, these are the ones
you wanna sleep with.
These are the women
who believe exactly what you believe.
These are the women
who would be willing to sleep with you.
And right there,
in the little triple intersection...
...is your ideal mate.
Odds are she's a short physicist
with low self-esteem...
...who lives in a government
research facility in China.
What's your point?
To keep having a sexual relationship
with Penny...
...I have to give up everything I believe in?
My intellectual integrity?
The very nature of who I am?
I can't do that, Howard.
I respect that.
- What is that?
- Your new girlfriend.
Have fun tonight.
"The dog."
"The roof."
"Grapes."
One minute.
- What was that?
- It means, "Come in."
It's taking forever to load the new
operating system on my computer.
I disinfected the kitchen
and the bathroom.
Now I thought I'd learn Finnish.
That's Hindi for,
"Whatever floats your boat."
Listen, I got a text
from that girl Abby...
...and she and Martha
wanna hang out with us again.
- What do you say?
- I don't say anything.
I merely offer you a facial expression
that suggests you've gone insane.
- I don't get it. You had a great time.
- Yes, exactly. I had a great time.
That's done.
I've moved on to other things.
For example, after I learn Finnish,
I'm not going to learn Finnish again.
Please, Sheldon.
I'm a lost Indian boy far from home...
...and I want a girlfriend,
and I want her to be Abby...
...and she'll only come
if she can bring Martha.
I highly doubt
there is any argument you can make...
...threat you might levy,
rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation...
...supplication or "vetoomus"
that you can employ...
...that would convince me
to reconsider.
My Incredible Hulk hands
signed by Stan Lee.
Oh, my.
I've admired these for years.
Does that mean
we can go out with the girls again?
Hulk agree to second date
with puny humans.
You can't wear the hands on the date.
Hulk sad.
Hey.
Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh?
Not only is it courteous,
it's safety-smart.
Every year, 15,000 fires are caused
by accidental dryer-lint ignition.
And now you're supposed to say,
"Wow, what an interesting fact.
Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy.
I could never be mad at you."
Wow. That's all you got after you were
the most obnoxious person...
...on a double date
that included Howard Wolowitz?
No, I'm sorry. I really am.
It's not right
to mock what a person believes in.
Thank you.
You willing to go to my psychic
and see what it's about?
You willing to read a book...
...that concisely explains
how all psychics are frauds?
I would not.
- Okay, let's go see your psychic.
- Really?
Well, yeah.
One of us has to keep an open mind.
- Saying I don't have an open mind?
- No. Let me help you with this stuff.
You know, I believe in ghosts too.
- Great.
- And astrology.
I know.
And pyramid power and healing crystals.
Oh, no, no, no. Crystals don't work.
Really? That's the line?
Psychics are real,
but crystals are voodoo?
Oh, voodoo's real.
You don't wanna mess with voodoo.
Flatland is more
than just a mathematical essay.
It is also a treatise
on Victorian social mores.
You know,
I had never considered that.
Wow. I mean, that's going
to completely change my visits there.
- Well, it's late.
- Uh-huh.
Time for bed.
Okay.
Good night, puny human.
Sheldon?
Yes?
Listen, they're kind of getting busy
in the living room...
...and I was wondering
if I could hang out in here for a while.
Well, I suppose. Come in.
I'll sleep in Leonard's room.
Good night.
