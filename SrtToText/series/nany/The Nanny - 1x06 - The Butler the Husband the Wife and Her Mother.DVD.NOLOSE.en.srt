1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,843
C'mere, little mouse.

2
00:00:05,843 --> 00:00:08,526
Here, little mousey, wousey.

3
00:00:08,526 --> 00:00:11,712
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We just wanna put you outside.

4
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:14,862
And then we're going
to kill you.

5
00:00:14,862 --> 00:00:17,744
Niles!  Why are
you being so macho?

6
00:00:17,744 --> 00:00:21,740
It's really unattractive,
yet somehow a turn on.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,072
Miss Fine, need
I point out to you

8
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:29,051
that the inspectors from the Professional
Butlers Association are coming Monday
to observe my work

9
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:31,874
and decide whether
to accept me as a member.

10
00:00:31,874 --> 00:00:34,177
Oh, really?
I thought you were joking.

11
00:00:34,177 --> 00:00:39,307
It sounded so ridiculous
in a profound and important way.

12
00:00:39,307 --> 00:00:44,068
I happed to come from a long line
of butlers, each one a member.

13
00:00:44,068 --> 00:00:49,125
Until my father, who butlered
to the Duke of Carlisle,
accidentally knocked over a vase.

14
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,137
And for that
they kicked him out?

15
00:00:51,137 --> 00:00:55,019
He was wrestling naked
with the Duchess at the time.

16
00:00:56,126 --> 00:01:01,079
Well, to each his own,
unless Duchess was a sheepdog.

17
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,486
All right, children,
time to go.

18
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:55,993
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You're not going
to the museum in those boots, are you?

19
00:01:55,993 --> 00:01:58,530
My willies?  Yes,
there's a chance of rain.

20
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,212
There's a chance I'll fall off the chair,
but you don't see me wearing a seatbelt.

21
00:02:04,212 --> 00:02:05,635
Your point?

22
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:08,725
What happened?
You're normally so G.Q.

23
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:11,855
Now suddenly you're
the Gordon's fisherman?

24
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:16,068
Miss Fine, I did not hire you
as my fashion consultant, I hired
you to take care of the children.

25
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:19,735
Well, it's my day off.
I fashion consult on the side.

26
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:22,031
Your son was just elected
class president.

27
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:26,961
Don't be an embarrassment
to him on his first day.
Who are you, Billy Carter?

28
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:29,574
Ah, here he is.
Hail to the Chief.

29
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:33,086
Thank you, thank you.
I am a crook.

30
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,099
I still can't believe
you got elected. / Why?

31
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,190
Well, that means someone
had to vote for you.

32
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,345
Now, Maggie, you should be
proud of our brother.  He worked
very hard on his campaign.

33
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:44,220
You wrote his speeches, came up
with his campaign platform,

34
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,958
and organized the school bus tour.
/ He's my Hillary.

35
00:02:48,984 --> 00:02:52,577
Well, it all paid off.  Aren't
you glad I talked you into running?

36
00:02:52,577 --> 00:02:54,740
Now you're a winner like your old man.

37
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,248
Did I ever tell you I was
president at my House of Eaton? / Yes.

38
00:02:58,248 --> 00:03:03,474
Well, I was.  But this is your victory,
and we're all very proud of you.

39
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:08,442
President Sheffield.  He's a man
of vision and a leader amongst men.

40
00:03:08,442 --> 00:03:11,572
Thank you.
/ Now zip your fly.

41
00:03:11,572 --> 00:03:16,713
So, now we're off to celebrate
Brighton's achievement by taking in the
German expressionist show at the Met.

42
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:20,689
There's a fine line between reward
and punishment in this house.

43
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:25,369
I love that Vamouche's painting,
"The Scream."

44
00:03:26,865 --> 00:03:28,963
So, Fran, what are you
doing on your day off?

45
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:30,937
Well, I'll tell you
what I'm not doing.

46
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:35,340
I am not having lunch with my Uncle Jack
and cousin Marsha who are visiting from Boca.

47
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,308
Believe me, an afternoon with
Jack and Marsha, well, don't ask.

48
00:03:39,308 --> 00:03:43,087
I don't think I did.
/ Jack was always trying to one up my mother.

49
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:45,716
We bought a Skylark,
he bought an Eldorado.

50
00:03:45,716 --> 00:03:48,200
We moved to Flushing.
He moved to Florida.

51
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,564
I'm telling you,
she could never win.

52
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:55,080
Oh, yeah.  Once.
She grew a moustache before him.

53
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,160
Go, go, have a good time.
/ All right, everybody.

54
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,527
Oh, has Mister Sheffield gone?
/ Yeah, they just left.

55
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:05,453
And boy, could
they talk your ear off.

56
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,415
That's too bad.  Lauren Bacall
just sent over some beluga caviar.

57
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,600
Oh, caviar...

58
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,158
For Mister Sheffield.

59
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,147
Oh yeah, of course.

60
00:04:15,147 --> 00:04:18,601
You make the toast,
I'll write the thank you.

61
00:04:26,547 --> 00:04:30,778
Come here, little fishes.
Come to mama.

62
00:04:33,318 --> 00:04:35,574
Oh, hi, Ma.

63
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:37,718
Hi, darling.

64
00:04:38,183 --> 00:04:39,321
What are you doing here?

65
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,983
I gotta tell you about
my lunch with Jack and Marsha.

66
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:44,090
Oh, and I was having
such a nice day.

67
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,905
So we're sitting,
we're eating.

68
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:49,957
And as usual, Jack is going
on and on about Marsha.

69
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,923
Marsha and her doctor husband.
/ Yeah.

70
00:04:51,923 --> 00:04:54,432
Marsha and her four
karat solitaire.

71
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:58,977
Marsha and her beachfront property
right next to Dan Marino.

72
00:04:58,977 --> 00:05:02,861
Who the hell is Dan Marino?
/ How the hell should I know?

73
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:06,055
Anyway, I was just about to scream
when they asked me about you.

74
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:10,244
So I told them that you eloped
with a rich Broadway producer,

75
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:13,577
and you're living in a palace
on the upper eastside.

76
00:05:13,577 --> 00:05:17,626
Oh, Ma, what's the matter
with you? / What?

77
00:05:17,626 --> 00:05:20,519
You left out the butler.

78
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:24,240
Meanwhile, how'd they take
the good news?  Crushed?

79
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,404
Devastated.
/ Better.

80
00:05:26,404 --> 00:05:28,632
You should have seen
the look on their face.

81
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:32,292
I would have liked to.
/ You will.

82
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,969
Oh, no.  No way, Ma.
Where are they?

83
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:40,155
Looking for a place to park...

84
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:44,454
Oh, good, they found one.

85
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:47,949
Oh, forget it, Ma.
I'm not doing this.

86
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:51,606
Fine.  That's your choice.
It's good to have choices.

87
00:05:51,606 --> 00:05:54,867
Not that I had a choice
when I was in labor with you

88
00:05:54,867 --> 00:06:01,239
for ten hours
with that big head.

89
00:06:02,717 --> 00:06:05,671
Sorry.  It won't
happen again.

90
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:07,982
Darling, do it for me.

91
00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:10,593
It'll shut Jack up
once and for all.

92
00:06:10,593 --> 00:06:13,093
Oh, Ma, is it really
so important to you

93
00:06:13,093 --> 00:06:15,897
that I have to pretend
to be something I'm not?

94
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:18,579
Would you?
/ No.

95
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,654
Hi.
/ You caught a husband.

96
00:06:21,654 --> 00:06:25,346
Thank God you're not
an old maid anymore.

97
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:28,651
Welcome to my home.

98
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:32,447
Huh?  Jack?  Hun?
Is this a palace?

99
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:36,067
She's living like Seigfried and Roy.

100
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:38,468
Not bad.  How many
square feet?

101
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:43,047
Oh, we don't get into all that.
As long as we're comfortable,
that's all that matters.

102
00:06:43,047 --> 00:06:45,785
Your place is what, darling?
/ Thirty-eight hundred.

103
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:48,828
Ours is thirty-eight thousand.

104
00:06:48,828 --> 00:06:52,006
The upstairs is enormous.

105
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:56,018
I'd put out a spread,
but the butler is off today.

106
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:59,592
¡®The butler', Jack.
/ Yeah, I heard, Syl.

107
00:06:59,592 --> 00:07:02,578
So, this has just been fabulous,
but you know,

108
00:07:02,578 --> 00:07:05,936
if you guys missed your flight,
I'd just never forgive myself.

109
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:09,868
Fran, you don't think we'd go home
before we met the lucky man.

110
00:07:09,868 --> 00:07:12,934
You mean you wanna meet
Mister Sheffield?

111
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:15,474
You call your husband Mister Sheffield?

112
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:19,085
Oh, well, that's just a pet name.
You know, Sheff, Sheffie.

113
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:21,505
Chef-boy-r-dee.

114
00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:26,864
Ma, stay out of my private life.

115
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:30,473
Anyway, unfortunately,
Maxwell is at a rehearsal.

116
00:07:30,473 --> 00:07:33,425
He's rehearsing "Sunday
In The Park With George",

117
00:07:33,425 --> 00:07:37,035
so he won't be home till Monday.

118
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:41,119
Ma, is there oxygen
on your planet?

119
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:45,662
Aunt Sylvia, you are
such a kidder.  We'll wait.

120
00:07:45,662 --> 00:07:49,280
You mean, you're just gonna
stay here until he comes home?

121
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,808
We got full fare tickets.
No restrictions.

122
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:54,336
We can stay forever.

123
00:07:54,336 --> 00:07:57,836
I'm just going to run
down to the bank.

124
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:04,311
Honey, you're home!
/ Beg your pardon?

125
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:08,398
Rehearsal went quick, huh?
These are my relatives from Boca.

126
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:12,372
Oh... Oh, Sheffie, stop it.

127
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:14,498
He is so naughty.

128
00:08:14,498 --> 00:08:18,803
You're Mister Sheffield,
I'm your wife, and we're
deliriously happy.

129
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,217
This is a big favor you're asking.

130
00:08:25,217 --> 00:08:28,921
So is keeping my mouth shut
about the crack in the Ming vase.

131
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:31,620
Maxwell Sheffield, producer.

132
00:08:31,953 --> 00:08:33,835
Jack Norman, realtor.
/ How do you do?

133
00:08:33,835 --> 00:08:37,219
I'm Marsha.  So nice to meet you.
/ Likewise.  And you are?

134
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:40,919
Your mother-in-law.
/ Oh right, of course.

135
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,646
I was drunk at the wedding.

136
00:08:45,511 --> 00:08:48,908
Hiya, Mummsey.

137
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:51,402
So, Max...

138
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:53,879
Max?! / Oh, that's me.

139
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:57,686
I take it business is very good.
/ Oh yes, too good.

140
00:08:57,686 --> 00:09:01,612
Yes, I, I curse every moment
I'm away from my beautiful bride.

141
00:09:01,612 --> 00:09:03,660
Oh, Sheff...

142
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:07,721
Of course, I hobnob with
the rich and famous,

143
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:10,640
but the only time I'm truly
happy is when I'm with her.

144
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,367
She's my center, my compass,
the light of my life.

145
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:19,839
Sorry.  Sometimes I just get swept up
in the magic that is Fran.

146
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:24,002
Well, who could blame you?

147
00:09:24,002 --> 00:09:27,980
So, where are your kids?
I wanna meet your kids.

148
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,178
Or, should I say, 'his kids.'
'Cause you know, they're not
the fruit of your womb.

149
00:09:32,178 --> 00:09:36,522
Yeah, that's why this womb
could still wear a bikini.

150
00:09:37,731 --> 00:09:43,333
Unfortunately, the children, who
adore my sweet Fran, went to the museum.

151
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,269
They're very cultured.

152
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:50,072
They're off by themselves?
In this city?

153
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:54,841
Marsha, please, what kind of
mother do you think I am?

154
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:57,553
They're with... Who are they with?

155
00:09:57,553 --> 00:10:00,707
Niles the butler.
/ I thought it was his day off?

156
00:10:00,707 --> 00:10:04,594
It is.  But it's...
What do they call it again?

157
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:07,510
I can't wait to hear.

158
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:12,022
Oh, Butler Day at the museum.
/ Butler Day?

159
00:10:12,022 --> 00:10:15,728
Sure.  Bring a butler,
get a free beverage.

160
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:19,570
Oh, please, babe,
you always get the door.

161
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:23,518
Let me wait on you
for a change.  Oh...

162
00:10:26,452 --> 00:10:27,385
Who are you?

163
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:31,329
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.
We're from the Professional
Butlers Association.

164
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:34,694
We're here to observe Niles.

165
00:10:34,694 --> 00:10:36,892
May we come in?
/ In here?  Now?

166
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:40,275
Oy.  I thought you guys weren't
supposed to be here until Monday?

167
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:45,303
Well, it's our policy to show up early
to catch the perspective member unaware.

168
00:10:45,303 --> 00:10:49,186
But unfortunately, Niles isn't here.
Is he, darling.

169
00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:52,497
No, darling,
I'm afraid Niles is out.

170
00:10:52,497 --> 00:10:54,691
Well, you all come back
and see us, you hear.

171
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:57,185
Actually, darling,
that might not be good.

172
00:10:57,185 --> 00:11:01,744
If they come back to observe Niles,
they might confuse him with someone else.

173
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,204
Oh, yeah.

174
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,949
Oh, what the hell, come in.

175
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:08,577
We'll tell you everything you
need to know about Niles.

176
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:13,037
I take it, sir, you are the
master of the house. / Apparently.

177
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:16,670
These guys are from
the Butlers Association,

178
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:21,695
and they wanna talk to me and him,
Max, about our butler, Niles.

179
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:25,284
Who isn't here.  Ma, you got a Rolaids.

180
00:11:26,205 --> 00:11:29,221
Are you fellas also butlers?
/ Yes, we are.

181
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:32,547
Well, I'm surprised
you're not at the museum.

182
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:37,899
You're not gonna believe this,

183
00:11:38,475 --> 00:11:42,003
they closed the museum
because of a bomb threat.

184
00:11:42,003 --> 00:11:45,588
What kind of world are
we living in?  Here.

185
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,748
And who is this person?

186
00:11:50,748 --> 00:11:55,367
That would be Niles, the butler.

187
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:05,470
I leave this house for
just twenty minutes,

188
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,841
and I come back to some
bizarre parallel universe.

189
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:13,996
You're me, I'm you, and
you're married to her.

190
00:12:13,996 --> 00:12:17,009
He could do worse.
/ And I have.

191
00:12:17,676 --> 00:12:20,677
Please, sir, I would be
the last to coerce you but...
/ Coerce, coerce.

192
00:12:20,677 --> 00:12:24,024
...I would point out that if Miss Fine's
relations see through our little charade,

193
00:12:24,024 --> 00:12:27,265
they'll never let her forget it,
or her poor mother.

194
00:12:27,265 --> 00:12:31,918
And if you don't do this for Niles,
he'll never get into the Butlers Association,

195
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,955
and his family name will
be mud forever.

196
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,719
By the way, Niles,
what is your family name?

197
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:41,149
It's just Niles.  Like Cher.

198
00:12:42,768 --> 00:12:47,269
The important thing is your employees
are bonding.  It's a beautiful thing.

199
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:51,081
Yes.  Perhaps you'll get
your next job together.

200
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:53,270
Father, I think we should
go along with it.

201
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,505
Fran and Niles do so much for us,
it's the least we can do for them.

202
00:12:56,505 --> 00:13:01,774
Oh how sweet.
/ And I get to boss Daddy around.

203
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:05,250
It's, it's absurd.  I'm not
doing it, and that's final.

204
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,796
Speaking as an elected official,
what we have here is domestic gridlock.

205
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:15,976
A failure of the executive branch
and the house to work together.

206
00:13:18,873 --> 00:13:22,696
I still can't believe
someone voted for you.

207
00:13:22,696 --> 00:13:25,255
No, no, Brighton's
thinking is good.

208
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:29,250
His point being that what
we need here is a compromise.

209
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,623
Meaning I do what you want
and compromise my integrity.

210
00:13:32,623 --> 00:13:35,879
That's democracy
in action.

211
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:38,086
All in favor?
/ Aye!

212
00:13:38,086 --> 00:13:40,530
Look, if you can pull
off this charade, fine.

213
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,192
But I'll have no part of it,
and neither will the children.

214
00:13:43,192 --> 00:13:45,190
So what you're saying is,
we have no rights.

215
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,741
None whatsoever.
/ Just checking.

216
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,689
I am so parched.
You got something to drink?

217
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:58,590
Niles. / Sorry.  You got
something to drink, Niles?

218
00:13:59,556 --> 00:14:03,312
Uh, where's he going?
I believe somebody asked for a drink.

219
00:14:03,312 --> 00:14:05,940
There are drinks in the kitchen.
Please help yourselves.

220
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,099
Such insolence.
How can you put up with it?

221
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:12,346
Well, we've been
together for many years.

222
00:14:12,346 --> 00:14:16,316
Many, many years.

223
00:14:16,316 --> 00:14:21,400
It's a question of loyalty.
/ And friendship.

224
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,925
You can't really
blame the butler.

225
00:14:23,925 --> 00:14:27,507
After all, the help reflects
the hostess and, let's face it,

226
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:31,806
poor Frannie here is
in way over her head.

227
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:40,479
Will that be crushed
ice or cubes, sir?

228
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:43,982
All right, Dad...e-o,
my butler,

229
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:47,107
with whom I have a cool kind of
hep-cat, kind of beatnik kind of...

230
00:14:47,107 --> 00:14:50,522
Shut up, Brighton. / Thank you.

231
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,083
I apologize for the momentarily lapse.
The bomb scare must have rattled my nerves.

232
00:14:56,083 --> 00:15:00,414
Yeah, he's been a wreck ever since
all that unpleasantness in the Falklands.

233
00:15:00,414 --> 00:15:03,357
Oh you saw action, too.
What ship were you on?

234
00:15:03,357 --> 00:15:05,724
The other one.

235
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:09,761
Oh, Niles, the butler?

236
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:10,963
Yes, Grace?

237
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:15,148
I love this.  While you're at it,
how 'bout some ice cream?

238
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:18,130
Will there be anything else?
/ Can I have a soda?

239
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:24,353
We can have anything we want.
He's Niles, the butler.

240
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,293
Oh, Niles, do you know what
I'm thinking? / What, Brighton?

241
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,364
That's Master Brighton.

242
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:35,570
I'll be having my ice cream in the soda,
and a round of Oreos for my friends.

243
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,958
I don't thing your father would approve
of all these sweets in the middle of the day.

244
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,554
Well, that's not really your call,
is it, Niles, old man?

245
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:50,166
Can we, Daddy?
/********

246
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:55,024
**************
/ She never says that to m.

247
00:15:55,024 --> 00:15:59,204
That' 'cause you're Niles the butler.
/ Brilliant.

248
00:15:59,204 --> 00:16:04,310
And a fabulous butler he is.
/ We'll be the judge of that.

249
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:09,847
No pressure.

250
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:16,460
Are these darling children
or what? / Gorgeous.

251
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,337
We're very proud of Brighton.
He was just elected president of his class.

252
00:16:21,337 --> 00:16:24,734
Aw shucks, Mommy,
there you go again.

253
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:30,366
How impressive.
You should see my Libby.

254
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:33,613
Here she is at
the Equestrian Center.

255
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:36,240
Oh, beautiful smile.

256
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,507
That's Lightning.
That's Libby.

257
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:45,903
Oh look, she's got your nose.
The old one.

258
00:16:48,404 --> 00:16:52,660
Oh, Niles, back again so soon?
Speedy service as always.

259
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,463
Well, thank you, sir.  All part
of being a good butler.  Oh...

260
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:05,002
Oh, he is just a master
at physical comedy.

261
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:07,948
Enough, Niles,
you're killing me.

262
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:13,375
Would you like me to get it?

263
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,577
No.

264
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,173
I'm the butler.

265
00:17:17,173 --> 00:17:19,356
I'll get it.

266
00:17:21,462 --> 00:17:22,778
What now?

267
00:17:22,778 --> 00:17:26,113
It's probably for you.
Everyone I know is here.

268
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:29,246
Hey, Brighton. / Kevin, hi.
What are you doing here?

269
00:17:29,246 --> 00:17:34,196
I came here to invite you to the
inaugural party. / Great.  Thanks.  Bye.

270
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:37,786
Hear that, Marsha?  They're throwing
a party for the president.

271
00:17:37,786 --> 00:17:41,658
Yeah, Brighton, and I wanted you
to be there even though I slaughtered you.

272
00:17:41,658 --> 00:17:43,746
What? Brighton, what's going on here?

273
00:17:43,746 --> 00:17:47,198
Forget it, it's nothing. It's just...
/ No, no, no.  I, I wanna
know what this is all about.

274
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:51,032
This butler is a real budinsky.

275
00:17:51,032 --> 00:17:55,405
I lost the election, okay?
/ You lost?

276
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,408
Brighton?

277
00:17:58,023 --> 00:18:01,273
I knew no one would vote for him.

278
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:06,703
Brighton, I,
I just don't understand.

279
00:18:06,703 --> 00:18:09,409
I mean, why would you
say you won if you lost?

280
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:11,649
It seemed really important to you.

281
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:15,035
Maybe it was all that talk
about you being president at Eaton.

282
00:18:15,035 --> 00:18:17,404
I just mentioned it in passing,

283
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:20,623
about fifteen or twenty times.

284
00:18:20,623 --> 00:18:23,922
I just wanted you to think
I was a winner.  Like you.

285
00:18:23,922 --> 00:18:27,085
Angel, nobody wins all the time.

286
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:30,687
For every hit your father has,
he's had a ton of flops.  Am I right?

287
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:32,886
Well, I suppose...
/ How many flops have you had?

288
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:34,913
Well, I really couldn't say.
/ Well, a ball park.  How many flops?

289
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,738
I think he's got the point.

290
00:18:37,738 --> 00:18:41,387
You know what I'm getting at, angel?
/ Yeah, we're all a bunch of losers.

291
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:44,123
No.  Nobody's a loser.

292
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,583
Except my cousin Ira,
but that's another story.

293
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:51,417
You're a good man, Brighton.
Whatever happens, you can
always tell me the truth.

294
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:57,217
Really? / Well, of course.
I mean, what kind of parent would want
his child to pretend he's something he's not?

295
00:18:57,217 --> 00:19:00,147
My mother.

296
00:19:00,147 --> 00:19:02,490
Excuse me.

297
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,413
Oh, sure.  They got their
own Lear jet.

298
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:12,355
They flew me to Pennsylvania for a Hershey.

299
00:19:12,355 --> 00:19:15,297
Well, I'm lucky if she drives
me to the dog track.

300
00:19:15,297 --> 00:19:18,309
Okay, Ma, enough with the charade.

301
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:21,797
Eighty-six it.  I got them
eating out of my hand.

302
00:19:21,797 --> 00:19:23,764
Give it up, Ma, it's over.

303
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:29,068
God, you were just like
this with Perot.

304
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,509
From now on, we're telling the truth.

305
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:34,810
I'm not married.
This is not my house,

306
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:40,552
and I'm the nanny here.
And I work for Mister Sheffield.

307
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:44,349
You're a nanny?

308
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,858
Did you hear this, Daddy?
She's just a nanny.

309
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:51,673
Who asked you anyway,
you big green cow?

310
00:19:54,589 --> 00:19:57,029
Maggie.
/ What?

311
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,880
It's turquoise.

312
00:20:03,678 --> 00:20:08,740
And if I may speak as just the butler,
I was here before Miss Fine's arrival,

313
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,349
and I can tell you she
has made this house more...

314
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:18,593
chaotic, more contentious,
definitely louder.

315
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:22,463
Now she and Mister Sheffield may
not always se eye to eye,

316
00:20:22,463 --> 00:20:26,067
but at the risk of overstepping,
I don't think I've seen him or the children

317
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:29,594
this happy for a very long time.

318
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:33,273
Oh, thank you, Mister...Niles.

319
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:37,344
That was a very moving speech.
/ And totally inappropriate.

320
00:20:37,344 --> 00:20:39,744
I'll decide what's
inappropriate in my home.

321
00:20:39,744 --> 00:20:42,034
I like a bit of sentiment
among the servants.

322
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:44,434
Did you hear that, Daddy?  Servant.

323
00:20:44,434 --> 00:20:47,181
Yeah.  That must really hurt, Syl.

324
00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:50,841
Oh, shut-up, Jack.
At least she's got a job.

325
00:20:50,841 --> 00:20:55,841
I wouldn't trade my Fran
for all the Marshas in Miami.

326
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:59,367
Now go get the car,
I'll meet you out front.

327
00:21:01,453 --> 00:21:05,323
It's not turquoise,
it's emerald.

328
00:21:06,195 --> 00:21:09,598
This has been a most unusual visit.

329
00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:13,826
But despite the charade being played
all around you, you managed
to maintain your dignity.

330
00:21:13,826 --> 00:21:17,771
Niles, we'd like to welcome you to
the Professional Butlers Association.

331
00:21:17,771 --> 00:21:21,364
Well, I don't know what to say.
I'm really rather touched.

332
00:21:22,627 --> 00:21:24,622
Oh, I'll get it.

333
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,508
Good afternoon, all. / Oy.

334
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:38,435
I just had a fabulous conversation with
our investors and I think I secured
the Saint James Theatre for January.

335
00:21:38,435 --> 00:21:42,705
That's wonderful!
Did you hear that, Mister Sheffield?

336
00:21:42,705 --> 00:21:46,533
Yes, I heard and
I'm very excited.

337
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:48,590
Niles?  Maxwell?
What's going on around here?

338
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,870
He's Niles.
/ He's Mister Sheffield.

339
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,478
Who are they? /	We're from
the Professional Butlers Association.

340
00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:57,930
And it seems we've been duped.

341
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:00,523
Hold it a second, boys.

342
00:22:00,523 --> 00:22:06,034
I'd like to know when the last time
you've seen a boss go to such
lengths for his butler,

343
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:09,205
and make such a complete
and utter fool of himself?

344
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:12,962
Not that you weren't adorable.

345
00:22:12,962 --> 00:22:15,089
The nanny has a point.
/ Yes.

346
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:17,887
And we do need the dues...

347
00:22:20,998 --> 00:22:23,486
You're in.
/ Oh!

348
00:22:25,054 --> 00:22:29,430
We'll show ourselves out.
/ We're butlers.
We know where the door is.

349
00:22:31,398 --> 00:22:35,248
Oh, I feel totally cleansed.
Everything is out in the open.

350
00:22:35,248 --> 00:22:37,546
No more secrets.

351
00:22:37,546 --> 00:22:40,526
Incidentally, Max, I ran into
Lauren Bacall at the theater

352
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:44,402
and she wanted to know
if you got the caviar she sent.
