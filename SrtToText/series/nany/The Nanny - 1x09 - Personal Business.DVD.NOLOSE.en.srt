1
00:00:05,326 --> 00:00:07,162
Oh, good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:07,162 --> 00:00:10,939
Oh, Miss Fine, another stunning yet
inappropriate breakfast ensemble.

3
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:14,684
You like?  They were having
a big sale at Victoria's Secrets.

4
00:00:14,684 --> 00:00:18,346
I bought some other stuff, too,
but that's my secret.

5
00:00:21,552 --> 00:00:26,180
Did you save the catalogue?
/ You can have it after I'm through.

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,505
Niles. / Well, Mother's Day
is just around the corner.

7
00:00:30,505 --> 00:00:31,595
Uh-huh...

8
00:00:31,595 --> 00:00:34,278
Good morning, everyone.

9
00:00:34,278 --> 00:00:35,581
Miss Fine!

10
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:38,747
What?  It was buy
one get one free.

11
00:00:39,494 --> 00:00:42,150
Ah, that must be my return
call from Osaka.

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,723
No, it's Eddie.  He's calling
me to say good morning.

13
00:00:44,723 --> 00:00:47,037
Well, I've lost my appetite.

14
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:52,929
Gee, you know with all the overseas
calls you make, I hope you get free
mileage with you long distance.

15
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:57,489
How delightfully bourgeois.
/ Bourgeois with a free-be to Bermuda.

16
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:59,993
Thank you, Niles. / Not so fast.
It's for Miss Fine.

17
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,815
Miss Valerie Torello.
/ Val is on my business line?

18
00:01:02,815 --> 00:01:06,961
Well it could be an emergency.
Val, what's the matter?  Who died?

19
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:12,872
Ahh...  Danny my ex is taking
Heather Biblow to Puerto Rico.

20
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:15,862
Miss Fine, nobody cares about
your boyfriend's vacation.

21
00:01:15,862 --> 00:01:20,120
Ex-boyfriend, sir.
/ And I care deeply.

22
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:22,826
Oh, Val, I'm getting some beeps
here.  Wait a minute.

23
00:01:22,826 --> 00:01:24,412
Oh, that must be Osaka on the
other line.  Hang up, hang up.

24
00:01:24,412 --> 00:01:27,659
Val, it's Japan calling for
Mister Sheffield.  I gotta hang up.

25
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,072
Whose water broke in Macy's?
/ Just, just give me that...

26
00:01:31,072 --> 00:01:34,687
Moshi, Moshi.  Val,
will you please hang up?

27
00:01:34,687 --> 00:01:37,581
No, I don't get free mileage
on my long distance.

28
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:39,994
Moshi, Moshi.

29
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:40,890
Nothing.

30
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,539
You must have lost him.
/ Me?

31
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:44,000
Me?
/ Yes, you.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,549
Couldn't be.
/ Then who?

33
00:01:47,748 --> 00:01:52,341
Miss Fine, let's just make
on simple rule, can we?  You keep
your personal life out of my business.

34
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:55,254
So what you're saying is,
if you've got a business meeting,

35
00:01:55,254 --> 00:01:57,464
I should keep my personal
feelings out of it

36
00:01:57,464 --> 00:02:00,553
and let you go out in that tie?

37
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:05,484
Let's just review.  Business.
Personal.  Business.  Personal.

38
00:02:05,484 --> 00:02:07,403
Let's have none of this.

39
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:10,670
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have business to attend to.

40
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,746
He's changing the tie.

41
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:06,727
Daddy, guess where we're going?

42
00:03:06,727 --> 00:03:10,507
Sweetheart, we're in the middle of work.
Who taught you to barge in like that?

43
00:03:10,507 --> 00:03:14,626
Yoo-hoo, Mister Sheffield.
/ Ah, it's all coming back to me.

44
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:16,604
Please, I'm on the phone!

45
00:03:16,604 --> 00:03:20,300
Well, I hope it's nothing personal,
'cause he'll snap your head off.

46
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:25,186
Do you want something?
/ A: I like your tie.
B: I need some money.

47
00:03:25,186 --> 00:03:26,922
I'm taking Gracie shopping.

48
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:30,370
It's time I learned
to coordinate my separates.

49
00:03:32,065 --> 00:03:35,411
She's growing up right
before my eyes.

50
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:38,598
Meanwhile, you're wearing on
Mary Jane and one saddle shoe.

51
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:41,236
I dare to be different.

52
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:43,199
Go change.

53
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,005
Soon she'll be ready for
the home-shopping network.

54
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:50,017
So, I'm off to go on duty.
You need anything while I'm out?

55
00:03:50,017 --> 00:03:52,730
Yes.  A leading man.
/ Oh, who doesn't?

56
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,625
Believe me, if they sold them
at Labels For Less, I'd have
one on layaway already.

57
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:00,541
Yes, I'll hold.

58
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:04,991
Nanny Fine, a synthetic fur.
How very p.c. of you.

59
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:08,518
What?
/ P.c. as in politically correct.

60
00:04:08,518 --> 00:04:13,133
Oh, well, actually
it's J.C., as in Penney.

61
00:04:14,918 --> 00:04:18,510
Your outfit is nice, too.
/ Of course, dear.  It's an Adolfo.

62
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,253
As in Hitler?

63
00:04:24,903 --> 00:04:26,831
Yes, I'm still here.

64
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:29,290
So he is interested.  Splendid.

65
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,173
Let me run it
by Mister Sheffield.

66
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:34,218
Yes.  Kiss, kiss.
Love you.  Ciao.

67
00:04:34,218 --> 00:04:36,389
What a phony.

68
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:40,203
Well? / You'll never guess who I've
talked into starring in our new show,

69
00:04:40,203 --> 00:04:43,918
pending a meeting with you
of course:  Brock Storm.

70
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,120
Brock Storm?!
/ Never heard of him.

71
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,998
You never heard of Brock Storm?
/ Yes.  We've established that.

72
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:54,402
He plays Doctor River Shane
on One Day After Another.

73
00:04:57,385 --> 00:04:59,901
He's on the cover
of Soap Digest.

74
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:02,816
I'll leave you my copy
in your bathroom.

75
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:07,254
Maxwell, I'm telling you, Brock
is big. And we need a box office draw.

76
00:05:07,254 --> 00:05:10,556
Star's Deli already named
a sandwich after him.

77
00:05:10,556 --> 00:05:12,717
The Brockwurst.

78
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,084
My God, I've eaten him.
He is good.

79
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:20,898
He is perfect.

80
00:05:20,898 --> 00:05:22,748
He's beyond perfect.

81
00:05:22,748 --> 00:05:26,883
When Trista went into pre-mature
labor, after the plane crash,

82
00:05:26,883 --> 00:05:32,854
despite his two broken arms,
Brock delivered her baby.

83
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:36,788
How? / With his teeth.

84
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:42,187
I'm telling you, he is the most
perfect man in the world.

85
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:46,096
He's playing a part, Miss Fine.
It's an act. Hence the term actor.

86
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:51,589
Oh, no.  No one can act
that good.  He is truly sensitive.

87
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:55,553
When he cries, snot comes
out of his nose.

88
00:05:56,634 --> 00:05:59,659
Oh, the man is gifted.

89
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:08,508
You're doing fine, Oklahoma.

90
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:10,453
Oklahoma.

91
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:14,733
O-K-H-L-O-F...
No wait.

92
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:17,896
Who needs to spell when
you look like that?

93
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:22,592
Oklahoma.  Yo!

94
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:26,109
Oh, that's marvelous!  Bravo.

95
00:06:26,109 --> 00:06:29,175
And so very loud.

96
00:06:29,175 --> 00:06:31,573
You do know I'm meeting
with other producers.

97
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:35,181
Andy has invited me out to his
place in Southampton for the weekend.

98
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:36,974
Andy Lloyd Webber? / Uh-huh.

99
00:06:36,974 --> 00:06:40,144
And there's no spelling
in his show.

100
00:06:40,144 --> 00:06:43,850
Remember, Brock, there's only
one maiden voyage to Broadway,

101
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,416
so take the ride with a producer
that can guarantee

102
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:50,155
you the epitome of style,
taste and class.

103
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:52,496
I don't know what I ate for lunch.

104
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,530
Oh yeah, quiche.

105
00:06:55,824 --> 00:06:58,041
Will you excuse me a minute?

106
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,409
Miss Fine, we're still in the
middle of our business meeting.

107
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh, is that today?  Oh gee,
if I would have known,
I would have dressed.

108
00:07:06,888 --> 00:07:10,081
Come on kids.  Come on over.
Your father has someone
he wants you to meet.

109
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:14,078
Uh, Brock, these are my children.
Brighton, Grace and Maggie.

110
00:07:14,078 --> 00:07:15,141
Hello.
/ Hello.

111
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:16,890
Hello!

112
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:21,850
We never should have let
her out of the attic.

113
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,197
And this must be
your gorgeous wife.

114
00:07:25,197 --> 00:07:29,298
No.  This is my less than
subtle nanny, Miss Fine.

115
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:32,559
Fran to you.  Or mon amour...
whichever.

116
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:35,647
Darling, je vous
aime beaucoup...

117
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:38,757
Frere Jacques, dormez vous...

118
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,155
Miss Fine,

119
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:43,805
a moment?

120
00:07:44,272 --> 00:07:45,550
Yes?

121
00:07:45,876 --> 00:07:48,478
Get out or I'll hurt you.

122
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,520
Got it.  Well, if you'll excuse me.
Oh, just one last thing.

123
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,085
All the while that you were
selflessly raising your son Eric,

124
00:07:56,085 --> 00:08:00,314
while his mother, Cheree, was
gallivanting all over Spring Valley,

125
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:03,859
did you know that he wasn't
your biological child?

126
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,594
Yes, I've always known.

127
00:08:05,594 --> 00:08:08,073
You are a god.

128
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:11,693
And a doctor.
I gotta lie down.

129
00:08:12,762 --> 00:08:15,930
I do apologize.
But I'm sure you must get that...

130
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:20,292
... sort of thing all the time.
/ Yeah.  Cool, huh?

131
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:24,005
So shall I call your agent?
/ Sure.

132
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:27,396
I'll need top billing.
Big letters.

133
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:29,462
More money than anyone else.

134
00:08:29,462 --> 00:08:32,761
Oh yeah, and the nanny.

135
00:08:35,276 --> 00:08:38,029
Can you believe
he wants my nanny?

136
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:41,243
Let him get someone else to
take care of his children.

137
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,135
Maxwell, he doesn't
have any children.

138
00:08:46,135 --> 00:08:48,019
Then what does he
want with my nan...?

139
00:08:50,455 --> 00:08:52,163
Oh.

140
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,981
God, this is boring.

141
00:09:00,981 --> 00:09:03,969
Brock hasn't even moved
since the last commercial.

142
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:06,102
Shh.  That's because
he's in a coma.

143
00:09:06,102 --> 00:09:08,594
Look, he's gonna
drool again.

144
00:09:08,594 --> 00:09:12,002
The man is a master
of bodily fluids.

145
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:14,460
But nothing's happening.

146
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,922
That's because you don't
know how to watch.

147
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:20,074
See how Nurse Judy is
clutching the I.V. pole?

148
00:09:20,074 --> 00:09:22,990
So she's dizzy.
/ So she's pregnant.

149
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,942
And Brock's the father.
/ I thought he was in a coma.

150
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:32,382
Plus he's had a vasectomy.
Is that man virile or what?

151
00:09:32,953 --> 00:09:37,448
What's a vasectomy?
/ Uh, it's elective surgery, honey.

152
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:41,899
Like when C.C. went to Switzerland
and came back without her thighs.

153
00:09:44,512 --> 00:09:47,273
Did C.C. have a vasectomy?

154
00:09:47,273 --> 00:09:49,321
No.  No, honey.

155
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:52,413
I hear she's given a few.

156
00:09:53,198 --> 00:09:58,018
Niles? / As if I have nothing better
to do than be at his beck and call.

157
00:09:58,018 --> 00:10:00,913
As if we were his servants.

158
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:03,264
Oh, yeah.
/ Oh, yeah.

159
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:10,037
No, no, no.  I, I will not.
I cannot make Miss Fine part of this deal.

160
00:10:10,037 --> 00:10:12,457
Oh, Maxwell, grow up.
/ It's unconscionable.

161
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:16,446
It's, it's morally bankrupt.
/ It's show biz.

162
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:21,969
What took you so long?
/ I fell, sir.

163
00:10:25,721 --> 00:10:28,074
But I think
I'm all right now.

164
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:30,910
I'll walk it off.

165
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,894
Maxwell, darling,
I'm begging you.

166
00:10:39,894 --> 00:10:43,211
We just have to do it.

167
00:10:44,392 --> 00:10:47,649
I find the whole
idea repulsive.

168
00:10:49,873 --> 00:10:52,769
Way to play hard
to get, sir.

169
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,044
Niles, get your
mind out of the gutter.

170
00:10:56,044 --> 00:10:58,871
Vacating the gutter, sir.

171
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:00,766
We're talking about
Brock Storm.

172
00:11:00,766 --> 00:11:03,957
He'll only do the show if
I set him up with Miss Fine.

173
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:06,691
Well it's not like she won't
be thrilled with the prospect.

174
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:10,371
She glommed on to him like
a refrigerator magnet.

175
00:11:10,371 --> 00:11:14,658
Yes, that's, that's true enough.
She was rather taken with him.

176
00:11:14,658 --> 00:11:20,071
So actually you'll be doing her
a favor as opposed to say, pimping her.

177
00:11:21,034 --> 00:11:22,680
Thank you, Niles.

178
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,264
Always there for you, sir.

179
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,066
Oh, oh...

180
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,528
Oh, I can't believe how
cute all the men are.

181
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:38,342
Cute but so dysfunctional.

182
00:11:38,342 --> 00:11:41,080
A lethal combination, ladies.

183
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,907
Miss Fine, Mister Sheffield would
like to speak with you in his office.

184
00:11:43,907 --> 00:11:46,014
Oh, what did I do?

185
00:11:46,014 --> 00:11:48,452
If he asks you anything
about my fall,

186
00:11:48,452 --> 00:11:50,534
just play along.

187
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,359
All right, I'll do it,
but I won't like it.

188
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:56,876
Where have I heard that before?

189
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,679
Oh, Miss Fine, do come in.

190
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,206
I'm sorry.  But who knew nail
polish remover would eat off the finish.

191
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:07,467
What finish?
/ Nothing.

192
00:12:07,884 --> 00:12:11,513
Miss Fine!
/ Oh, Maxwell, lighten up.

193
00:12:11,513 --> 00:12:13,687
Sit down, Miss Fine.

194
00:12:13,687 --> 00:12:15,087
Fran.

195
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:16,894
Franala.

196
00:12:18,535 --> 00:12:21,206
Oh now I'm really scared.

197
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:27,590
What would you say if I arranged dinner
this evening for you and Brock Storm?

198
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,489
Wait.  Is this
a hypothetical question,

199
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:33,426
or are we wasting time when I should be
putting the electric rollers in my hair?

200
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:37,380
Roll away, Miss Fine.
/ Oh my god!  A date with Brock Storm?!

201
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,166
I can't believe you
would do this for me.

202
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:43,547
Oh, well, you know...
/ It's our pleasure.

203
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:47,188
We just want you to have
a good time.  A very good time.

204
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:49,214
Not that good a time.
/ We want her to have a good time.

205
00:12:49,214 --> 00:12:51,578
Have as good a time as
you want, but no more.

206
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:55,256
Well, I'll just play it by ear.
Oh, thank you, Mister Sheffield.

207
00:12:55,256 --> 00:12:58,450
Oh, thank you, Miss Babcock.

208
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,726
That was close.

209
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,487
See?  That wasn't so bad, was it?

210
00:13:04,487 --> 00:13:08,127
Knock, knock.  It's Franala.
/ We missed you.

211
00:13:08,127 --> 00:13:12,655
Uh, would Brock by any chance
have the hots for me,

212
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:16,621
and, and it would be better for
you and your show if I went out with him?

213
00:13:16,868 --> 00:13:20,919
Miss Fine, how could you imply...
/ Shut-up, C.C.!

214
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,533
Yes, yes, it's true!

215
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:27,160
We're sacrificing you to Brock
to close our filthy business deal!

216
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,646
All right..

217
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:35,125
Uh-oh.
/ What?

218
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,978
A date with Brock,

219
00:13:36,978 --> 00:13:42,650
now wouldn't that be mixing
business with personal?

220
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:45,363
You know.

221
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:52,996
Maxwell, what is this?
And why are you doing it with her?

222
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:56,472
Oh, just some silly rule I made.

223
00:13:56,472 --> 00:13:58,456
What say we forget that rule?

224
00:13:58,456 --> 00:14:00,830
Oh, no.  Rules are rules.

225
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,020
Rules are made to be broken.

226
00:14:03,415 --> 00:14:04,796
I don't know.

227
00:14:04,796 --> 00:14:07,876
Forget the rules!  I hate the rules!
New rule!  No rules!

228
00:14:07,876 --> 00:14:11,938
I want you to mix business with personal.
I want you to call Val on my business line.

229
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:13,895
Invite her over, have a party!

230
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:17,919
Here, take my credit card,
redecorate the house!

231
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:21,283
All right.

232
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,560
Maxwell, if you don't mind,

233
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,763
I think I'll handle the
negotiations with Brock's agent.

234
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:47,351
Oh, honey, the secret to putting
on blush is less is more.

235
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,003
The exact opposite
of hair spray.

236
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,636
Oh, isn't it amazing how our
lives are completely the same?

237
00:14:55,636 --> 00:14:58,769
I mean, you're going out with
the hottest soap star,

238
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:01,352
and I'm dating Eddie.

239
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,687
It's scary. Come on,
where's my lipstick?

240
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:07,761
How do I look?

241
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:12,501
Like my Aunt Shirley before
her cataract surgery.

242
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:14,156
Here, sweetie.

243
00:15:14,156 --> 00:15:17,778
Fran, can I borrow some perfume?
/ Oh, sure, help yourself.

244
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:22,210
No. That's my scent.
You take the Charlie.

245
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:25,921
A few drops strategically
placed on the pulse points.

246
00:15:25,921 --> 00:15:27,923
Here, here

247
00:15:27,923 --> 00:15:31,978
and one right between
the ...eyes.

248
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:33,169
The eyes?

249
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:37,491
Yes.  The brain is the sexiest
organ.  Right, Val?

250
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:43,345
Where's Val? / Oh, what a walk-in.
If it had a bathroom, you could sublet.

251
00:15:43,854 --> 00:15:45,998
Did you smell the
padded potpourri hangers?

252
00:15:45,998 --> 00:15:48,955
Please.  I had to
take an antihistamine.

253
00:15:49,678 --> 00:15:51,071
Oh, come in.

254
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,773
Miss Fine, Mister Storm's blown in.

255
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:58,707
Oh, my god!  I can't believe my best
friend's going out with Brock Storm!

256
00:15:59,203 --> 00:16:01,790
Okay, everyone.  Let's just calm down.

257
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,557
He's just a person.
It's just like any other date.

258
00:16:05,557 --> 00:16:09,960
Now I'm gonna go down and
I'm gonna say hello to
Mister Brock Storm.

259
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,486
That's all.

260
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:16,203
Don't start with me, Niles.

261
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:22,199
So, Brock, now that you're
in a coma on the show,

262
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,211
aren't you afraid of
being killed off?

263
00:16:24,211 --> 00:16:28,478
I'll recover the minute
we settle my contract. / Uh-huh.

264
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:31,711
Why?  What have you heard?

265
00:16:33,068 --> 00:16:35,407
Ah, Brock, I've just got off
the phone with your agent,

266
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:38,242
and I think we'll be able to
strike a deal.

267
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:43,013
Fabulous!
/ Yes, well, the negotiations are going...

268
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:45,602
Oh, I'll tell you later.

269
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:47,450
Hi, Brock.

270
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,070
Darling, you look spectacular.

271
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,889
Which makes me look even better.

272
00:16:56,286 --> 00:16:59,928
Brock, I want you to meet
my best friend, Valerie Torello.

273
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:01,929
Go ahead, Val, embarrass me.

274
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:06,943
Oh, Mister Storm, it's such
a thrill to shake your hand.

275
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:10,913
Was it as good for you
as it was for me?

276
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:13,609
Two seconds.  That's a record.

277
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,273
Well, I hope I dressed okay, Brock.
I didn't know what we were doing.

278
00:17:18,273 --> 00:17:20,440
Anything you want. / Oh...

279
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,873
Ah, mon amour... mon amour...

280
00:17:22,873 --> 00:17:25,223
Take a picture.  Take a picture.

281
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:29,994
Is it just me or is he the phoniest
human being on earth?

282
00:17:29,994 --> 00:17:33,388
Would that be counting
Miss Babcock?

283
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:40,178
Oh, Mister Sheffield, this is
the most exciting night of my life,
and I owe it all to you.

284
00:17:40,178 --> 00:17:42,646
Oh, you don't owe me anything.

285
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:46,687
You don't owe him anything either.
Nothing is owed.

286
00:17:47,748 --> 00:17:49,733
Don't wait up.

287
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:57,283
Is everything all right, sir?

288
00:17:57,283 --> 00:17:59,908
Oh, of course.  She seems Fine
with the arrangement.

289
00:17:59,908 --> 00:18:04,186
Indeed.  She was floating on air.
/ Hot air, I might add.

290
00:18:04,186 --> 00:18:08,107
Sir, are you worried that
she'll have a bad time or a good one?

291
00:18:08,107 --> 00:18:12,535
You know, Niles, you're starting
to get on my nerves.

292
00:18:12,535 --> 00:18:16,088
All in a day's work, sir.

293
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:29,864
That was a delicious meal,
wasn't it?

294
00:18:29,864 --> 00:18:33,524
I never knew Happy Hour
could be so filling.

295
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:39,862
Do you think my hair looks better
parted on the right or the left?

296
00:18:39,862 --> 00:18:44,153
Well, let's see, you had
it parted on the left for the nachos.

297
00:18:44,153 --> 00:18:49,648
And then you switched it for
the buffalo wings.  Am I right? / Uh-huh.

298
00:18:49,648 --> 00:18:53,117
Why don't you split the diff and
part it down the middle?

299
00:18:55,739 --> 00:19:00,802
Uh, Kaleeb, there's my mansion now.
Why don't you just drop me off at the corner?

300
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:03,932
Driver, keep driving.
What's your rush?

301
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:07,949
It's a school night.
/ It's the shank of the evening.

302
00:19:08,182 --> 00:19:12,031
And your eyes beckon
me to the shore

303
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:16,077
where I will crash on you lips.

304
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:23,054
You said the same thing to Nurse Judy
and now she's hanging on an I.V. pole.

305
00:19:23,054 --> 00:19:27,102
Well, it's time for
some intensive care.

306
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:31,595
And the doctor is in.

307
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:36,931
That's it.  You know, I have a good
mind to report you to Soap Opera Digest.

308
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:40,299
You are nothing like
Doctor River Shane.

309
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:42,199
No.

310
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:45,893
But I'm exactly
like his evil twin.

311
00:19:59,553 --> 00:20:02,508
Oh, Mister Sheffield. / Oh...

312
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:05,419
What are you doing down here?

313
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:07,321
Were you waiting up for me?

314
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:09,727
Of course not.
I was just reading a book,

315
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:12,420
that's here somewhere.

316
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,464
Is she home yet?
/ Go back to sleep.

317
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:20,003
So how was your
evening with Brock?

318
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:22,863
Oh, don't ask.

319
00:20:22,863 --> 00:20:26,494
The guy was only
interested in one thing.

320
00:20:26,494 --> 00:20:29,897
Hello.  My father
was finally right.

321
00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:37,144
I feel like such a loser.
/ You can't blame yourself.

322
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:40,832
The man's a cad.  I'd like
to ring his... / Peanuts?

323
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:44,690
He took advantage of you naivete
and complete lack of sophistication.

324
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:48,552
Don't forget incredible stupidity.
/ Right.

325
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:51,769
Oh, what am I doing here?
Take this away form me.

326
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:54,657
This could easily turn
into a ten-pound binge.

327
00:20:54,657 --> 00:20:57,113
I hold myself completely
responsible.

328
00:20:57,113 --> 00:21:00,880
I let my own self-interest
compromise your virtue.

329
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,632
Oh, are you adorable?

330
00:21:03,918 --> 00:21:06,590
Oh, now, Miss Fine,
let's not misconstrue.

331
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,559
We don't want to mix business
with personal.

332
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,718
Oh, you're not starting on
that jag again, are you?

333
00:21:12,718 --> 00:21:15,926
We're living together, sort of.

334
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:20,276
Some of this is bound to happen.
/ Yeah, I suppose.

335
00:21:20,276 --> 00:21:23,228
You know, it's the strangest thing,
but when you went out that door
with him this evening,

336
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:29,300
I thought if something terrible
were to happen I would actually care.

337
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,438
Don't gush.

338
00:21:35,703 --> 00:21:39,804
Look at us, a couple
of nut eaters.

339
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:45,500
Oh, Mister Sheffield, I hope
I didn't screw up you play.

340
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,637
Well, frankly, after the way Brock
treated you this evening, I'm not sure
I'd care to work with him anyway.

341
00:21:49,637 --> 00:21:56,177
Oh, too bad, too.  Because now
he could really hit those high notes.

342
00:21:59,032 --> 00:22:01,527
Goodnight, Mister Sheffield.

343
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:05,467
Does that mean she kicked him in the...
/ Goodnight, Brighton.

344
00:22:18,064 --> 00:22:21,637
Does 'shamageggy' have two g's or three?

345
00:22:21,637 --> 00:22:24,724
That's not a word.
/ You never heard of shamageggy?

346
00:22:24,724 --> 00:22:27,303
Oh, you never met my cousin Ira.

347
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:30,101
Now let's see, the double
word score makes thirty

348
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:34,384
and the 's' turns moron
into morons, carry the naught.

349
00:22:34,384 --> 00:22:36,795
Fifty-seven points.
Where's the bag?

350
00:22:36,795 --> 00:22:40,121
No, absolutely not.  I don't
want another soap star.

351
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:43,177
They might be big box office,
but there must be another way to go.

352
00:22:43,177 --> 00:22:47,730
If you hear some beeps, I'm expecting
a call from Val. / Oh, this is Val.

353
00:22:48,297 --> 00:22:50,244
Fran, I'm stuck.
What do I do next?

354
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,279
Let me see.

355
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:55,492
Gently push the pony tailer
through the back of the pony

356
00:22:55,492 --> 00:23:00,651
to create a hairdo that will epitomize
fantasy and femininity. / Ow!

357
00:23:00,651 --> 00:23:03,252
Please.  I'm trying to watch
One Day After Another.

358
00:23:03,252 --> 00:23:07,126
Oh look, they've replaced Brock Storm.
I wonder what happened?

359
00:23:07,126 --> 00:23:10,012
How do you spell eunuch?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
