1
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,584
Hello, my name is Maggie Sheffield,
 and I'm a total geek.

2
00:00:09,584 --> 00:00:13,583
You are so immature. 
/ Yeah, Brighten, you're so immature.

3
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:15,102
Ha, ha, ha.

4
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:18,930
Miss Fine, you're mother's 50?

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,405
Isn't she stretching
 the truth just a tad?

6
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:26,177
Please, the only thing stretched 
more is Clinton's bicycle shorts.

7
00:00:27,831 --> 00:00:31,508
Fifty billion served and
 that's the white house.

8
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:37,601
Gee, I wonder
 if my daughter Fran is at home.

9
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:40,431
I will see if she is.

10
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:42,037
Come on, kids, get ready.

11
00:00:42,037 --> 00:00:46,217
Fran, how come we're practicing
 the surprise party?  Then it
 won't be a surprise.

12
00:00:46,217 --> 00:00:48,698
Oh, sweetie, at your age 
a surprise is a big thrill.

13
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:53,935
At her age, they're already rubbing
 two paddles together and yelling clear.

14
00:00:55,185 --> 00:01:00,510
Surprise! 
/ Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.

15
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:08,304
Ma, I hope you fake 
it better with daddy.

16
00:01:11,663 --> 00:01:15,345
I was his first.  
What does he know?

17
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:18,195
Excuse me, Miss Sylvia,
 I just want to double-check the menu.

18
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:21,173
Meat balls, cocktail franks,
 cheese puffs --

19
00:01:21,173 --> 00:01:25,486
is there some reason you don't
 want your family to handle silverware?

20
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,547
Darling, don't you know?

21
00:01:27,547 --> 00:01:31,127
If it's on a toothpick,
 it's not fattening. / Oh ...

22
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,294
Yeah, my Aunt Frita 
uses two like chopsticks.

23
00:01:35,294 --> 00:01:39,314
She looks like a very heavily 
made-up praying mantis.

24
00:01:42,946 --> 00:01:44,947
Are there going to be any boys
 my age at this party?

25
00:01:44,947 --> 00:01:48,681
Maybe we can fix her up 
with little Cousin Irvie.

26
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:52,923
Oh, he's a nice boy with
 a wonderful personality.

27
00:01:52,923 --> 00:01:58,628
Oh, Yeah, good idea, Ma.  Is he still
 ringing the bill at Notre Dame?

28
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:04,156
Don't worry, don't worry.  When I see
 him coming, I'll give you a very subtle sign.

29
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:09,916
Ah, there's the birthday girl.

30
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:14,369
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, you're such 
a doll letting us have my party here.

31
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:18,657
You know, we only have
 one toilet and, um,

32
00:02:19,454 --> 00:02:23,871
Morty's brothers are all coming.

33
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:29,175
Oh, oh, that reminds me.  Sweetie, 
go put an Airwick Solid in every bathroom.

34
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:34,155
So, Miss Babcock, are you coming
 to my surprise party?

35
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:38,874
I'm afraid not. 
/ And it's just killing us.

36
00:02:38,874 --> 00:02:41,541
We're taking the train to Gene 
Shallots for the weekend.

37
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,390
Gene Shallot ...  Hoo-ha.

38
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,465
Is he sexy or what?

39
00:02:47,465 --> 00:02:50,190
Ma, Gene Shallot sexy?

40
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,409
Oh, you gotta stop inhaling
 when you spray your hair.

41
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:57,790
They're having a little gathering
 before the Tony nominations.

42
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,707
Maxwell and I are sharing a guest 
cottage right by the water.

43
00:03:01,707 --> 00:03:05,604
How convenient, sir, should you
 want to drown yourself.

44
00:03:06,134 --> 00:03:08,191
Oh, Miss Fine, here.

45
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:12,866
Allow me to contribute this exquisite 
Chanbertin to your mother's party.

46
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:16,025
Maxwell, I thought this wine was
 for our weekend.

47
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:19,425
I don't think the Fines would 
appreciate a vintage Burgundy.

48
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:22,604
Yes, we're very big
 on vintage beverages.

49
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:27,226
In our storage bin we've got a case 
of Tab from the Bay of Pigs.

50
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:29,545
All right.  Maxwell, I'll meet
 you at the station.

51
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:32,591
I want to pick up the perfect 
hostess gift for the Shallots.

52
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:37,323
What do you think would just make 
their weekend? / Miss the train.

53
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:33,064
This will be a great party, a bunch of
 60-year-old ladies pinching my cheeks.

54
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,960
Learn to love it.  That's as close
 to a woman as you'll ever get.

55
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:42,555
I have two words for you.  
Cousin Irvie.

56
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:46,332
Just think of this party as
 an educational experience.

57
00:04:46,332 --> 00:04:50,462
Pretend you're Dian Fossey
 observing the gorillas.

58
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,325
Just don't get too close when they eat.
  You could lose a hand that way.

59
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:57,618
What's all that gunk 
at the bottom of the bottle?

60
00:04:57,618 --> 00:05:02,163
Um, honey, that's the best part.
  It's the wine concentrate.

61
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:07,930
Oh, my God.  What are you doing 
with Mr. Sheffield's best Burgundy?

62
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,680
I'm making a sangria.

63
00:05:13,637 --> 00:05:15,773
Does it need more Equal?

64
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,938
Two more packs.

65
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:21,022
Oh, Miss Fine, using that 
wine to make sangria

66
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:25,644
is like asking Pavarotti 
to sing "Muscrat Love."

67
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,714
He should only have the career
 Captain and Tonille.

68
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:37,167
Oh, kids, before I forget, go dig out 
my Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass album.

69
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:40,781
I really want this party to cook.

70
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,078
Oh, Niles, I thought 
that you made dip.

71
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,793
I did.  That's portobello mushrooms,
 shallots, and chives.

72
00:05:48,793 --> 00:05:53,667
Oh, now, I'm going to have to go to 
the store and get some onion soup mix.

73
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:57,872
Oh, I had to get the Pringles anyway.

74
00:05:59,028 --> 00:06:02,167
Cheer up.  Did I mention my Cousin 
Sophie is coming today?

75
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:05,583
Don't tell me.  She's smart and has
 a wonderful personality.

76
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:11,132
No.  She's dumb as a post, 
but she's built like a brick --/ Say no more.

77
00:06:11,132 --> 00:06:14,580
Just give me a subtle signal.

78
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:21,976
Where's Maxwell? / Oh, I thought 
he was meeting you at the station.

79
00:06:21,976 --> 00:06:25,166
He already left. 
/ Niles!

80
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,824
I called and said that
 I would pick him up here.

81
00:06:27,824 --> 00:06:29,786
I told you to give
 him the message.

82
00:06:29,786 --> 00:06:33,340
Oh, I thought you said
 give him a message.

83
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:37,138
I didn't think that was appropriate.

84
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,218
I'm not going to let anything 
bother me this weekend.

85
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:44,251
As long as I'm here, I might as 
well pick up a little wine.

86
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:48,334
Put Maxwell in the mood.  Did I tell
 you we have a private compartment?

87
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:51,696
And tonight there's a full moon.

88
00:06:52,152 --> 00:06:55,737
Well, I hope she packed 
a lot of Nair.

89
00:06:58,923 --> 00:07:02,997
Luck be a lady tonight.

90
00:07:02,997 --> 00:07:07,675
Luck if you've ever been
 a lady to begin with,

91
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:10,632
luck be a lady to --

92
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:19,337
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, no.

93
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:24,296
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. I can't
 believe this has happened.

94
00:07:24,663 --> 00:07:31,526
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
 ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ahhhhhhh.

95
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:41,401
Okay, there must be another 
way out of here.

96
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:48,207
Miss Babcock, I OD'd on the Equal.  
Could you pass me another bottle of Burgundy?

97
00:07:48,207 --> 00:07:50,848
Oh, Nanny Fine, I love you.

98
00:07:50,848 --> 00:07:53,551
You fool ...

99
00:07:53,982 --> 00:07:57,498
Boy, do you blow hot and cold.

100
00:07:58,432 --> 00:08:03,356
You know, a lot of women go through their 
change early. It's nothing to be ashamed of.

101
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:06,556
You let the door close and now 
we're trapped in here,

102
00:08:06,556 --> 00:08:12,521
and I'm going to miss my train.
 / Okay, calm down.  Don't panic.

103
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:17,458
Maybe I can fix it.  Geez ...

104
00:08:22,486 --> 00:08:26,616
No ...  Help!  Help!  Help!  Help!!!

105
00:08:28,394 --> 00:08:33,097
Save it.  No one's going to hear you. 
This was originally built as a bomb shelter.

106
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:36,169
Hey, don't underestimate 
the power of these adenoids.

107
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:40,557
I once had next door neighbors
 that moved closer to the airport.

108
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:45,855
Hey, this room is very small, 
isn't it?

109
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:48,607
Why?  Are you claustrophobic? 
/ Oh, thank you.

110
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:51,365
Now you put it in my head,

111
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,250
and I'm reliving -- 
Loeman's -- dressing room

112
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,833
-- big sale -- 200 naked 
women all screaming

113
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:04,032
"Where did you find that?"

114
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:07,356
I was clinging to 
my mother's girdle.

115
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:09,833
Dimples, dimples, everywhere.

116
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:13,252
And not one on the face.

117
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:19,165
And then, and then, and then ...

118
00:09:19,654 --> 00:09:24,828
Look, an alarm box.  
You know, if we cut the wires,

119
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:27,880
we can trip the system and 
the cops will come and find us.

120
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,028
What have you got?

121
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:33,391
Ah ...  Nail clippers! 
/ Excellent ...

122
00:09:40,072 --> 00:09:44,947
Well, either that alarm
 is way too subtle

123
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:47,182
or

124
00:09:48,737 --> 00:09:52,127
I cut the fan off.

125
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:56,430
And now we can't breathe.
 Oh, by the way ...

126
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,071
What did you do that for?

127
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:06,610
Weren't you hysterical? 
/ No.

128
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,285
Oh, my mistake.

129
00:10:13,392 --> 00:10:16,358
Remember, when she walks in,

130
00:10:16,358 --> 00:10:19,447
we all yell "Surprise."

131
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:22,626
Why?

132
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:26,040
Because it's your daughter's
 50th birthday.

133
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,931
50?  She's got brassieres 
older than that.

134
00:10:30,836 --> 00:10:33,856
If she's 50, then I'm --

135
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:37,945
what do you know, she's 50.

136
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,144
I wonder if my daughter
 Fran is home?

137
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,125
I will see if she is.

138
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:50,939
Surprise!

139
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:54,817
Will you wait till she walks in.

140
00:10:58,764 --> 00:11:00,643
Oh, my God.

141
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:03,151
I had no idea.

142
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:09,084
Look at me. We were on our way
 to see "Shore Shank Redemption."

143
00:11:11,562 --> 00:11:15,094
Schmooze, come meet 
your Uncle Stanley.

144
00:11:15,094 --> 00:11:16,653
What are you talking about?

145
00:11:16,653 --> 00:11:18,927
Just go along with me.

146
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:24,760
Stan, look, Schmooze, you haven't 
seen him since he was this tall.

147
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,134
He's getting bar mitzvahed 
while you're on your cruise.

148
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:30,080
Sorry I'm going to miss it.

149
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,659
Here. This is from me 
and your Aunt Cookie.

150
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,351
Oh, thank you very much.

151
00:11:37,581 --> 00:11:41,210
We split everything 50/50.

152
00:11:44,257 --> 00:11:47,905
Oh, I can't believe 
I'm missing the party.

153
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:52,377
I mean how often does your mother
 turn 50?  Two, three times?

154
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:57,568
Here, have a drink. 
It'll calm you down.

155
00:11:57,721 --> 00:11:59,248
I don't drink.

156
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:03,151
What do you do when 
you're tense? / Hair.

157
00:12:04,341 --> 00:12:08,280
What? 
/ I do hair.

158
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:12,144
Don't even think about it.

159
00:12:12,144 --> 00:12:14,121
Fine.

160
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:18,370
Ninety-nine bottles
 of beer on the wall,

161
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,551
ninety-nine bottles of beer --

162
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:24,627
Can you do a nice
 little French twist?

163
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:28,693
So severe you want?  
Well, let me see what I can do.

164
00:12:28,693 --> 00:12:33,450
So tell me, what's doing?

165
00:12:33,873 --> 00:12:36,098
I can't believe this is happening.

166
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:39,898
This was supposed to be 
the weekend when Maxwell and I ...

167
00:12:40,096 --> 00:12:42,785
Go ahead.  I'm listening.

168
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:48,889
Well, last time we came this close.
 / Uh-huh.  Tilt.

169
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:52,775
We were coming back from 
a production in Sidney

170
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:56,522
when our plane had to make 
an emergency landing in the Fiji Islands.

171
00:12:56,522 --> 00:13:01,572
It was off season so it was deserted.
 Well, you can use your imagination.

172
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:05,219
Paint me a picture.  
Pretend, I can't.

173
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:08,403
We were in the bar; 
we'd had a few cocktails.

174
00:13:08,403 --> 00:13:13,198
Maxwell had that look 
in his eye. / Uh-huh.

175
00:13:15,148 --> 00:13:18,252
Well, he was too much of
 a gentleman.

176
00:13:18,726 --> 00:13:21,036
Let me get this straight.

177
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:25,909
He was drunk; you were
 the only woman on a deserted island,

178
00:13:27,054 --> 00:13:30,432
and he still didn't touch you ...

179
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:35,515
And you thought Gene Shallot 
was going to get him in the mood.

180
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:44,188
I'm very worried about Fran.

181
00:13:45,898 --> 00:13:48,071
Maybe she stopped
 to get your present?

182
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:50,315
She already gave me one.

183
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:52,710
What did you get me?

184
00:13:52,927 --> 00:13:55,066
Did you forget, Ma?

185
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:58,360
Forget my little girl? 
 Don't insult me.

186
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,043
It's out there with
 all the other presents.

187
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:02,805
Oh, Ma ...

188
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:05,525
Pssssss.

189
00:14:07,952 --> 00:14:12,002
Get out there and put this
 on the biggest box.

190
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,251
Mint Chocolate Chip,

191
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:37,633
Jamoca Almond Fudge,

192
00:14:38,247 --> 00:14:40,902
Pralines and Cream,

193
00:14:41,612 --> 00:14:45,366
that's it.  That's 30.

194
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:49,038
Oh, my God.  They lied.

195
00:14:50,197 --> 00:14:55,048
Why?  Thirty's a lot.  
Is 31 so catchy?

196
00:14:55,441 --> 00:14:58,663
Oh, wait a minute. 
 I forgot the sherberts.

197
00:14:58,663 --> 00:15:01,228
All right. 
 I'll start again.

198
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:05,425
Vanilla --
 / Stop it!

199
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:17,709
You know, this reminds me of when Blair 
and Tootie got caught in 
Mrs. Garrett's walk-in freezer.

200
00:15:18,646 --> 00:15:23,932
Thank God Natalie went in for
 a midnight snack.  Surprise, surprise.

201
00:15:25,103 --> 00:15:29,237
These are the topics
 we can no longer discuss.

202
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:32,556
What Woolite can and cannot do.

203
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:36,268
Anyone with the last name Cassidy,

204
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:41,091
odd shaped moles on Eastern Europeans.

205
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:45,024
All right.  Okay, but you're really
 restricting the conversation.

206
00:15:45,024 --> 00:15:48,592
Meanwhile, look how gorgeous
 your hair looks.

207
00:15:57,673 --> 00:16:00,136
I got one word for you.

208
00:16:00,498 --> 00:16:02,823
Styrofoam.

209
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:07,781
But that's not biodegradable.
 / Who's asking you to eat it?

210
00:16:08,743 --> 00:16:11,017
Hi. / Hi

211
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:13,788
What are you doing hiding
 over here by yourself?

212
00:16:13,788 --> 00:16:17,537
Well, actually, I'm trying to avoid
 running into this geek, Irvie.

213
00:16:17,537 --> 00:16:20,854
I'm Maggie.
 / I'm Irvie.

214
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:29,050
Good, Lord.

215
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:33,209
What are you doing home?

216
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,145
Niles, what is going on here? 
 Look at this place.  Where's Miss Fine?

217
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:42,171
Oh, she's missing. 
/ Missing?

218
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:45,236
Ssshhh.  Keep your voice down, sir.
  I don't want to alarm anyone.

219
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:50,188
This is very strange, Niles. 
 Miss Babcock's gone missing too. / Yippee!

220
00:16:54,869 --> 00:17:00,600
Why won't you play truth or dare? 
/ Because all your truths are so boring.

221
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,748
Come on ... 
/ No.

222
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:07,957
I'll let you do my makeup.
 / Okay.

223
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,322
Okey-dokey.  Ask me. 
/ Truth or dare.

224
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:16,696
Um, I pick truth.

225
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:21,376
Okay, if you could spend 
the night with anyone,

226
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:26,062
who would it be?  We both know.  
Game's over.  Suck in your cheeks.

227
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:29,787
You never know. 
 My answer may surprise you.

228
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,977
All right.  Shoot.

229
00:17:31,977 --> 00:17:34,883
It's Maxwell.

230
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:38,127
Get out of town.

231
00:17:39,036 --> 00:17:43,293
Well, to think that right now we could
 both be lying in front of a fire,

232
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:49,132
my head on his chest, 
him gently stroking my hair.

233
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:56,267
Honey, take some deep breaths.
  You're running out of oxygen.

234
00:17:56,267 --> 00:17:59,653
You're right.  Who am I kidding? 
 He doesn't care about me.

235
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:02,106
My therapist says 
I'm obsessed with him.

236
00:18:02,106 --> 00:18:05,089
How much did you have to 
pay to find that out?

237
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:08,434
If only he weren't 
so darn attractive.

238
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:11,538
He is cute. 
/ Tell me about it.

239
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:15,631
That little gray streak in his hair 
just makes me want to hummmm.

240
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:21,155
Now, you see, that would be 
the first thing I'd get rid of.

241
00:18:22,105 --> 00:18:25,382
Too Pepy LePew.

242
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:30,655
Have you ever seen him in 
a bathing suit? / No.  Aha!

243
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:33,735
Too bad.

244
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:37,908
I've seen him naked, though. 
Does that count?

245
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:47,578
When? / Oh, relax.  It was an accident.
  I walked in on him in the shower.

246
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,679
Forget it.  He locks now.

247
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:57,662
The truth is he's ruined me 
for other men, you know?

248
00:18:57,662 --> 00:18:59,741
You?  Next to Mr. Sheffield,

249
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:03,272
all the guys that I date seem 
like real morons.

250
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:09,065
Gee, I wonder if that's cause
 all the guys that I date are morons?

251
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:16,009
At least you date. I'm going to wake up
 one morning a dried-up old spinster.

252
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:18,263
Quiet.  Wait.

253
00:19:18,263 --> 00:19:22,010
Oh, if that didn't bring Niles down, 
we're doomed.

254
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,468
Who cares.  I might as well die. 
 Then I can at least haunt Maxwell.

255
00:19:26,468 --> 00:19:31,094
And don't think I won't be shaking
 a few chains in the butler's pantry.

256
00:19:31,285 --> 00:19:33,790
Stop it.  You're scaring me.

257
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,529
Oh, who cares, Nanny Fine, face it,

258
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:40,097
get out of this house while you can, 
or you're going to end up just like me.

259
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:41,706
No!

260
00:19:43,095 --> 00:19:45,788
Oh, there you are.  We've been
 looking all over for you.

261
00:19:45,788 --> 00:19:49,187
Hey, stand back.  Stay away from us,
 you destroyer of girls' lives.

262
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:51,678
What? / Go, tell him, sister.

263
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:55,785
Maxwell, thank God ...

264
00:19:55,785 --> 00:19:57,686
She never shuts up.

265
00:19:57,686 --> 00:20:01,273
She's been saying 
the most terrible things about you.

266
00:20:01,513 --> 00:20:04,878
Ladies, ladies, calm down.  Let's go upstairs
 where we can talk about this.

267
00:20:04,878 --> 00:20:07,806
You're obviously very shaken
 after your ordeal --

268
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:11,253
Cee Cee, have you done
 something with your hair?

269
00:20:12,028 --> 00:20:13,770
Miss Babcock ...
 / What?

270
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,400
You left your purse.

271
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:26,981
Darling, this was
 the best party ever.

272
00:20:27,617 --> 00:20:28,911
Oh, thanks, Mom.

273
00:20:28,911 --> 00:20:32,367
You know, next year I think we should
 invest in a new "Happy 50th Banner."

274
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:35,337
This one says "Vote Dukakis"
 on the back.

275
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,767
Good night. 
/ Good night.

276
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:48,671
So, Niles, did you let it out? 
/ Yes.  And the villagers were not happy.

277
00:20:49,607 --> 00:20:53,041
Meanwhile, where have
 you been for the last hour?

278
00:20:56,457 --> 00:21:01,239
So you met my Cousin Sophie,
 nice, huh? / Yousa!

279
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:06,542
Oh, come on, Yetta,
 Daddy's honking.

280
00:21:06,726 --> 00:21:08,753
Thank you for a lovely evening.

281
00:21:08,753 --> 00:21:12,105
And if you find
 a nice diamond cocktail ring,

282
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,742
you could send it 
to me at the home.

283
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:17,603
Yetta, you don't 
have a diamond cocktail ring.

284
00:21:17,603 --> 00:21:20,877
I'm just saying if you find one.

285
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:27,349
Some night, huh? 
/ What?

286
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:31,300
Well, I just can't help thinking about you
 and Miss Babcock being stuck together.

287
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,523
I mean, what on earth did
 you find to talk about?

288
00:21:33,523 --> 00:21:38,648
Oh, you know, this and that. 
 Your hair came up.

289
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:44,778
Really? / Yeah, she don't like it. 
 She thinks you look like Pepy LePew

290
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,805
Miss Fine, can I tell you
 something in confidence?

291
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:53,841
It's, it's about Miss Babcock.
 / I'm all ears.

292
00:21:53,841 --> 00:21:58,298
Well, I, I rather think 
she has a thing for me.

293
00:21:58,298 --> 00:22:01,449
Get out of town.

294
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,833
Well, since we're exchanging
 confidences, she did mention

295
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:10,275
that close encounter on Fiji.

296
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:14,003
Oh, I remember that.
 / Cocktails in the bar?

297
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:18,272
No, quinine at the British Consulate.
 I was taken deathly ill.

298
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:21,220
They rushed me to the hospital. 
 I was delirious for days.

299
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,358
Well, apparently delirium
 ran rampant on that trip.

300
00:22:26,516 --> 00:22:28,845
Beg your pardon? 
/ Oh, nothing.

301
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:32,563
I'm just sorry that you had to miss 
your weekend at Gene Shallot's.

302
00:22:32,563 --> 00:22:35,377
Actually, I felt like
 I was there.

303
00:22:35,377 --> 00:22:39,029
Your Aunt Ida bears 
a striking resemblance to him.

304
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:43,960
You know, I told her, 
if she was going to dye her hair,

305
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,385
do the mustache too.

306
00:22:57,327 --> 00:22:59,891
That's 75 for you

307
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:02,565
and 185 for me.

308
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:06,280
Hey, you said 50/50. 
 That's not fair.

309
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,585
Let's talk fair.  You live in a mansion.
 I live in a home.

310
00:23:11,585 --> 00:23:17,400
You got your whole life ahead of you. 
 I got one, two weeks tops.

311
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,285
You can eat corn.  
Here, let me show you something.

312
00:23:22,285 --> 00:23:24,774
Oh, take it.  Take it all.
