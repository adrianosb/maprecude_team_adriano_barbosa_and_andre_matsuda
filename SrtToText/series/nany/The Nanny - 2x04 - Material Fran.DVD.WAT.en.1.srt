1
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:06,197
Ah, I'll tell you,
 these personals are such a joke.

2
00:00:06,197 --> 00:00:08,138
Look at this,
 "single white female."

3
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:11,687
That could mean anyone
 from Madonna to Janet Reno.

4
00:00:13,352 --> 00:00:16,742
Oh, here's one,
 "exotic good looks."

5
00:00:16,742 --> 00:00:20,007
I'm seeing a debilitory problem.

6
00:00:20,693 --> 00:00:25,466
I ask you, what kind of a loser shells
 out 200 bucks for one of these?

7
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:28,433
How do you know
 how much it costs?

8
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:31,738
Niles, clean up that mess. 
/ What mess?

9
00:00:31,738 --> 00:00:33,990
That one.

10
00:00:36,157 --> 00:00:41,768
Sweetie, don't forget your RSVP
 for Jody's slumber party.

11
00:00:41,768 --> 00:00:43,189
I don't want to go.

12
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:46,147
Why not?  Sweetie, you get
 to eat like a pig,

13
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:48,458
make funny phone calls, 
and throw your guts up.

14
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,752
It's a very special time 
in a little girl's life.

15
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:55,766
Sure it sounds like fun, but I don't 
know if I can sleep without my bear.

16
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:57,970
So take Teddy with you?

17
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:03,088
Everybody will make fun of me.  
You have no idea how cruel children can be.

18
00:01:03,423 --> 00:01:07,808
Honey, I've had this voice since
 the second grade.  Need I say more?

19
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:10,955
I just don't know if I can sleep alone.

20
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:14,349
Oh, don't worry.  You get used to it.

21
00:02:04,044 --> 00:02:06,287
Oh, look.  Here's a gem.

22
00:02:06,287 --> 00:02:09,744
"Young bi-couple dig snakes,

23
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:14,242
contact Naomi, P.O. Box 666,

24
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:17,148
no weirdos."

25
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:22,832
Niles, move it with the food.

26
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:26,576
These society women are vultures.
  Where's the pate?

27
00:02:26,576 --> 00:02:30,687
Why don't you just lie on the floor
 and let them peck at your liver?

28
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,384
This luncheon is very important.

29
00:02:36,384 --> 00:02:40,243
These women are deciding between contributing
 to our show and the children's milk fund.

30
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:44,334
I don't want any thirsty little 
brats beating me out of that money.

31
00:02:45,628 --> 00:02:49,160
Fran, I need a favor.  Billy Hartwell
 wants to take me to a concert.

32
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,501
Oh, great.  What concert?
 / You wouldn't know them.

33
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:56,809
Maggie, how old do you think I am? 
/ The Stone Temple Pilots.

34
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,215
I'm 100.

35
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:01,945
So why?  You want me to ask 
your father if you can go?

36
00:03:01,945 --> 00:03:05,558
And ...  The concert's
 kind of sold out.

37
00:03:05,558 --> 00:03:08,642
So could you ask him
 if he could get us tickets too?

38
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:12,488
Oh, sure, Mags, you want
 backstage passes, fake I.D.'s,

39
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:15,686
the whole fat-chance package?

40
00:03:16,358 --> 00:03:18,137
Thanks, Fran.

41
00:03:19,185 --> 00:03:23,069
I don't know what they expect from me. 
 These are hands, not wands.

42
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:27,301
Although they have performed 
magic in their day.

43
00:03:27,301 --> 00:03:32,649
Niles, you know what those women pay
 to get that stuff sucked out of them?

44
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:36,994
I beg your pardon ...  Miss Babcock 
specifically requested fat-free cream puffs.

45
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:40,199
Oh, come on, this is loaded
 with butter, eggs, and heavy cream.

46
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,585
There's enough cholesterol 
in there to kill them.

47
00:03:42,585 --> 00:03:44,654
Oh, really?

48
00:03:47,354 --> 00:03:52,679
Ladies, it is my very great pleasure
 to introduce my very dear,

49
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:58,152
very close personal friend,
 Maxwell Sheffield.

50
00:03:58,152 --> 00:04:00,259
Who are these boring, 
dreadful women again?

51
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:04,589
They're wives of very rich men.
 / Ladies.

52
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:06,438
Brighten,

53
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:10,623
Brighten give her back that
 damn bear, you little...

54
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:15,591
Oh, hello.  Excuse me.  Pardon me.

55
00:04:15,591 --> 00:04:17,923
Fake Chanel.

56
00:04:21,474 --> 00:04:26,508
Kathy Marie O'Mally? 
 Oh, my God.

57
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:31,109
I'm terribly sorry.  Do I know you? 
/ Kathy, it's me, Fran Fine, from Flushing Heights.

58
00:04:31,109 --> 00:04:36,735
Wow!  They did a great job on your teeth.  
Look, your chin comes forward and everything.

59
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,867
I don't know... / Oh, and you
 finally got yourself a pair of...

60
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:48,209
This is Kathrine Porter 
of the Park Avenue Porters.

61
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:52,848
Now if I let you breathe again,
 will you go away?

62
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:55,101
Promise?

63
00:04:57,774 --> 00:05:00,644
I hope those are saline because...

64
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:08,349
Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop.

65
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,352
Why do you have to act so crude
 for at at such a fancy party?

66
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:14,386
Well, I'm just kidding around. 
/ Yeah, well, have a little class.

67
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:19,843
Now go help Niles clear.  And remember I got
 dibs on all the leftovers with no cigarette butts.

68
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,182
You know, Brighten's right.  
I can't live without I my bear.

69
00:05:26,182 --> 00:05:30,719
Let's face it, I'm codependent, 
and Teddy's my enabler.

70
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:33,444
Sweetie, I know it's tough.

71
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:36,725
I've had to ween myself off 
of lots of stuff.

72
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:41,612
Caffeine, cigarettes, my ex-boyfriend,
 Danny, and that was really tough.

73
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:45,694
Every time somebody burped garlic,
 I got a craving.

74
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,776
Oh, Fran, I'll try.

75
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:51,999
Oh, good girl.

76
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,624
But I'm going to miss
 his furry little body.

77
00:05:54,624 --> 00:05:58,053
That's the same way
 I felt about Danny.

78
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:02,312
Hi.  Are the leftovers ready yet?
 / Yeah, help yourself.

79
00:06:02,312 --> 00:06:05,426
Take that one.  
Just eat around the lipstick.

80
00:06:05,426 --> 00:06:10,850
Oh, you are never going to guess
 who is at the party out there.

81
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,935
Kathy Marie O'Mally. 
/ Get out of here.  Are you sure?

82
00:06:13,935 --> 00:06:15,795
Yeah.
 / Does she still have the shag?

83
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:18,724
No.  And she's nowhere without it.
 / Has she aged?

84
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:21,608
Like a bowl of fruit.

85
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:27,085
Has she had any work done? 
/ More than L.A. after the quake.

86
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:31,798
Meow Mix, ladies?

87
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,035
Excuse me.  Could somebody please
 point me to the powder room?

88
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:39,322
Ah, yeah.  Sure.

89
00:06:39,322 --> 00:06:43,598
Cause I busted out of gym class,
 and I'm dying for a smoke.

90
00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:44,644
Hey ...

91
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,061
Kathy,
 / I knew it was you.

92
00:06:49,061 --> 00:06:52,468
I was just telling Val how
 gorgeous you look.

93
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:55,847
So what's with the act?

94
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:57,932
Ah, what about
 Mr. French over there?

95
00:06:57,932 --> 00:07:01,183
Oh, Niles, you can trust him. 
 He's like Shultz.

96
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:05,304
I know nothing, nothing.

97
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:09,335
So what are you doing here?
 / Oh, I married up.

98
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:12,576
Wow!
 / What are you doing here?

99
00:07:12,576 --> 00:07:15,298
I'm the nanny. 
/ Oh ...

100
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:17,923
What? 
/ Oh, nothing.

101
00:07:17,923 --> 00:07:21,879
You know, I mean, it's just everybody
 thought you were really going places.

102
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,955
Oh, well, I showed them.

103
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,833
You remember Val?

104
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,920
I'm blank. 
/ Oh, sure you do.

105
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,690
Remember when we all used to go
 to Rye Beach Playland?

106
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:38,447
Val would get up early and stand
 in a parking spot until we'd get this.

107
00:07:38,447 --> 00:07:40,902
Those were the days.
 / Oh, yeah.

108
00:07:40,902 --> 00:07:44,178
So how'd you meet Mr. Right?
 / I sued him.

109
00:07:44,178 --> 00:07:46,623
Wow!  How romantic.

110
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:50,984
He rear ended me.
 / I'm not into that.

111
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:57,553
Now I remember you.

112
00:07:59,377 --> 00:08:04,286
You know, my husband has a partner. 
 Oh, Franny, you should meet him.  He's loaded.

113
00:08:04,286 --> 00:08:08,012
Oh, no.  I couldn't date anyone
 just cause he was rich.

114
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:09,783
What are you prejudice?

115
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:14,145
You going to hold it against him 
because he's got two Ferraris?

116
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:17,361
Oh, well, it's not really his fault.

117
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:20,149
A house in Monte Carlo?

118
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:25,384
When did I get so intolerant? 
/ A private jet and a diamond mind.

119
00:08:25,384 --> 00:08:29,367
Oh, you're right.  I'm a bigot. 
 I should be ashamed of myself.

120
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:31,799
I'm going to have
 to work through it.

121
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:39,160
I can't believe
 I'm going on this date.

122
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,682
I mean the man is a millionaire.

123
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:45,304
I'm just a simple girl 
with simple tastes.

124
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:52,126
Where's my other earring? 
/ I'm changing the bulb.

125
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:00,192
Fran, can you ask dad about the concert
 before you leave?  I'll die
 if I don't find out tonight.

126
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:04,566
Oh, well, we wouldn't want that to happen. 
 I get paid less with only two kids ...

127
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:09,337
Oh, Mr. Sheffield ...
/  No ...

128
00:09:09,337 --> 00:09:11,875
Oh, all right.  Forget it. 
/ Fran ...

129
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:15,704
Oh, no Maggie.  Give it up.  I mean
 he can't get you that those tickets.

130
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:17,479
He doesn't have
 those kind of connections.

131
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:22,416
I beg your pardon.  I can get tickets 
to any show on Broadway.

132
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,062
Oh, Broadway.  Sure, of course.

133
00:09:25,062 --> 00:09:27,788
I mean, you know, if she wants 
to go see Ann Miller in "Sugar Babies",

134
00:09:27,788 --> 00:09:33,361
you'll be the first one we call. 
 But this is the rock world, you know.

135
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:36,228
I mean it's way out of your sphere.

136
00:09:36,228 --> 00:09:40,075
I'll have you know I was staging
 happenings on Carnaby Street

137
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:45,243
while you were still scouring the semiannual clearance sale at Toys R Us.

138
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:49,067
Does the word "Donovan" mean
 anything you to?

139
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:51,538
Oh, I loved him.

140
00:09:51,538 --> 00:09:55,226
"They call me mellow yellow" ...

141
00:09:55,713 --> 00:09:58,122
Quite rightly.

142
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:07,878
Meanwhile, explain to me
 "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."

143
00:10:07,878 --> 00:10:11,410
The girl with colitis goes by?

144
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:20,736
I always thought that was 
very distasteful.

145
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:25,687
That's the girl with kaleidoscope
 eyes, Miss Fine.

146
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:27,455
Oh ...

147
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:34,123
Leave it to Flushing to turn a beautiful 
image into a bowel dysfunction.

148
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,504
Well, don't you worry, Maggie. 
 I will get you those tickets.

149
00:10:40,504 --> 00:10:43,925
Electrical banana ...

150
00:10:45,362 --> 00:10:48,367
Let's hope that's not hereditary.

151
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:51,189
Thank you, so much, Fran. 
 That was awesome.

152
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:55,972
Oh, well, I might be old, but 
the noodle is still sharp as a tack.

153
00:10:56,969 --> 00:11:00,825
Oh, my God, Nanny Fine.  Don't tell 
me you're wearing that cheap tacky dress

154
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:05,124
to meet Richard Porter's oldest friend. 
 I wouldn't be caught dead in that dress.

155
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:08,645
You'd have to be dead 
six months to fit into it.

156
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:16,153
Wow, this could be 
the man of my dreams.

157
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:19,770
He could be handsome.  
He could be sexy ...

158
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:28,907
or he could be my grandfather.

159
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:31,843
How do you do?  
I'm Theodore Timmons.

160
00:11:31,843 --> 00:11:35,905
When you said he was Richard Porter's 
oldest friend, you weren't kidding.

161
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:39,918
Theo, I'm Fran.

162
00:11:40,361 --> 00:11:44,439
I hope you're not disappointed? 
 I know I'm not.

163
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:47,152
Oh ...  please, come in.
  Sit down.

164
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:49,832
I couldn't decide between
 flowers and candy.

165
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:54,851
Oh, well, isn't that the old age
 question... age old, age old.

166
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:03,545
You're a, a beautiful young woman.

167
00:12:03,545 --> 00:12:07,328
Be still my heart. 
 Not too still.

168
00:12:08,613 --> 00:12:12,481
Oh ... Theo, stop.  
Woops!  Don't fall.

169
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:21,395
My God, what on earth are
 all these flowers for?

170
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:24,248
Either Miss Fine's date with 
Mr. Timmons went extremely well

171
00:12:24,248 --> 00:12:27,698
or he died and we're
 hosting the wake.

172
00:12:28,586 --> 00:12:32,737
Oh, poor thing.  And she was so 
looking forward to this date.

173
00:12:32,737 --> 00:12:36,859
I just hope he isn't using her
 to get to her bone marrow.

174
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:40,944
All right.  Decorum.

175
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:45,631
She's probably humiliated enough without 
walking in and finding us laughing at her.

176
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,444
Yeah, you're right.  Poor thing.

177
00:12:48,964 --> 00:12:51,775
Good morning, everyone.

178
00:12:52,568 --> 00:12:57,714
Oh, would you look at all these
 flowers for a handshake.

179
00:12:57,714 --> 00:13:01,778
What do you get for
 a goodnight kiss?  Holland?

180
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,489
What?

181
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:09,273
Bam-pa-pa-bam ...

182
00:13:12,348 --> 00:13:15,585
Miss Fine, aren't you a little
 overdressed for breakfast?

183
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:20,944
Oh, well, obviously you've never been
 to morning services at Temple Emanuel.

184
00:13:22,063 --> 00:13:26,710
I, I take it the date of
 a crowning success.

185
00:13:27,526 --> 00:13:30,239
Thank you, Sheckie Sheffield.

186
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,854
Actually, it went a lot better
 than I expected it to.

187
00:13:34,854 --> 00:13:38,126
For starters, he lived through it.

188
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:43,515
All right.  So he's a little
 more mature than I'm used to.

189
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:47,513
Mature?  Fran, we're talking
 "Encino Man."

190
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,706
Does he at least have a good body?
 / Oh, honey, you know Fabio?

191
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:57,258
Put his feet on Burgess Meredith.

192
00:14:00,614 --> 00:14:03,875
Well, I'm glad to see you're not
 taking this too seriously.

193
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:07,701
Who said I wasn't?  He happens
 to be very sweet, very witty,

194
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:11,454
and just full of cash... 
I mean life.

195
00:14:12,782 --> 00:14:15,509
I don't know,
 he just makes me feel young.

196
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:19,019
Miss Fine, he would make Stonehenge feel young.

197
00:14:19,437 --> 00:14:22,972
Ah, you know, Maggie, Theo owns
 a couple of recording labels.

198
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:25,680
Maybe he could get you those
 tickets to the concert?

199
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,050
I said I'd get those tickets,
 and get them I shall.

200
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,737
Oh, well, maybe he could get
 you backstage passes?

201
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:35,152
Back stage? 
 I'll get her on the stage.

202
00:14:35,152 --> 00:14:39,387
They'll even break a bloody 
guitar over her blasted head.

203
00:14:39,957 --> 00:14:41,455
Cool.

204
00:14:42,478 --> 00:14:45,430
Miss Fine, Mr. Timmons to see you.
 / Oh ...

205
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,269
Sheffield, I'm sorry to
 interrupt your breakfast,

206
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:52,276
but I, I just had to see
 my baby doll.

207
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:57,680
Oh...  Well, I guess
 I'm the only baby doll here.

208
00:14:58,123 --> 00:15:00,224
Oh... Theo.

209
00:15:00,224 --> 00:15:05,028
I had the sweetest dreams last night,
 and they were all about you.

210
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:09,260
Oh, Theo.  Stop.  Whoa!

211
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:16,741
You were covered in diamonds, kiddo.

212
00:15:17,002 --> 00:15:20,848
Oh, Theo, you are so extravagant,

213
00:15:20,848 --> 00:15:24,414
but really, let's get to know 
each other first.  Honestly,

214
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:29,687
a good conversation to me is worth 
more than all the jewels in the world.

215
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:33,563
Do you want to have dinner in Paris? 
/ Enough said.

216
00:15:45,341 --> 00:15:49,998
Talk about elegance, this is the first time 
I've ever been in a toilet on a plane

217
00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:53,637
where I didn't feel like I was going
 to be sucked out over the Atlantic ...

218
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:54,397
Thank you ...

219
00:15:57,443 --> 00:16:00,019
Say, are they even going 
to say two words to us?

220
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:02,729
I mean how am I going to get to
 know Theo better...

221
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,315
Franny, leave them alone.

222
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:07,815
Every minute they don't talk to us, 
they make another million.

223
00:16:07,815 --> 00:16:15,016
Well, money is nice, but there are more
 important things than... is that lobster?

224
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:20,257
Hey, babe 
/ Not now, I'm eating

225
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:30,235
Aren't you going to eat too? 
/ No, I'm going to nap.

226
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:34,330
How could you nap with 19.95 
a pound staring you in the face?

227
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:39,020
Franny, stick with me, and you will 
be sleeping through caviar.

228
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:45,560
I hate waste.

229
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,999
How's the champagne?
 / Oh, it's nice and dry.

230
00:17:15,874 --> 00:17:20,291
You know, at Sizzler they take
 it out of the shell ...

231
00:17:27,642 --> 00:17:33,901
Oh, Theo, you know, I've never been 
to Paris, but I've always wanted to go,

232
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:36,916
ever since the "Facts of Life" 
girls went there.

233
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:40,288
Babe, you and Kathy do the town.
 Buy whatever you want.

234
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:46,652
What?  I'm not going to see you all day? 
/ Oh, look at that little lip, like a baby.

235
00:17:46,652 --> 00:17:50,222
Theo, I'm serious.  
I don't want to go all alone.

236
00:17:51,425 --> 00:17:53,814
Whatever you say, baby.

237
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:59,450
Kathy, baby, come
 sit in daddy's lap.

238
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,176
What's he going to do? 
 Burp you? / If he wants.

239
00:18:15,673 --> 00:18:19,130
I thought the Eiffel Tower leans.

240
00:18:20,471 --> 00:18:22,401
No, Val.

241
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,190
That's Big Ben.
 / Oh.

242
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,261
What's eating you?

243
00:18:28,543 --> 00:18:31,331
Oh, I'm breaking up with Theo. 
/ Why?

244
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:37,111
Because he takes me to Paris,
 and all I did was fly in a private jet,

245
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:41,791
shop at the finest stores, eat
 in a five-star restaurant, and go home.

246
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,153
Drop dead.

247
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:49,424
Val, he doesn't care about what
 I have to say.

248
00:18:49,424 --> 00:18:53,527
I'm nothing but window dressing
 to him, a beautiful ornament.

249
00:18:53,527 --> 00:18:56,071
Vanna White.

250
00:18:57,316 --> 00:18:58,963
You love Vanna.

251
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:01,946
I know.  But I don't want to be her.

252
00:19:01,946 --> 00:19:06,578
I want to buy the vowels. 
 I want to solve the puzzle.

253
00:19:07,956 --> 00:19:12,250
Oh, Fran, you should write that down.

254
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:17,131
I want a relationship, 
a real relationship.

255
00:19:17,131 --> 00:19:19,542
Like Luke and Laura.

256
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:24,312
Fran, listen to what you're saying. 
 It's ridiculous.

257
00:19:24,312 --> 00:19:27,826
Luke would never leave her again.

258
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,324
Val, you're going to have 
to move away from those power lines.

259
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:38,331
All I'm saying is that I need 
a guy that cares about what I think.

260
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:41,251
Miss Fine, what do you think?

261
00:19:41,406 --> 00:19:45,415
I've got these concert tickets for Maggie, 
but now I'm having second thoughts
 about letting her go.

262
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:49,096
You know, we're really in
 the middle of something here.

263
00:19:49,096 --> 00:19:53,439
Why don't you get another pair. 
 We'll sit a couple of rows back; 
we'll keep an eye on her.

264
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:57,700
Oh, excellent idea, Miss Fine. 
What would I do without you?

265
00:19:58,433 --> 00:20:02,855
All I'm saying is
 I need a guy who needs me.

266
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:07,185
The driver is here.  Are these all
 the things you want sent back to Mr. Timmons?

267
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:08,389
Yes.

268
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:11,108
Let me see your hands.
 / No.

269
00:20:11,387 --> 00:20:13,897
Must I get the poultry shears?

270
00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:16,748
Oh, all right, but Niles ...

271
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:20,355
diamonds are a girl's best friend,
 and now I'm all alone.

272
00:20:20,355 --> 00:20:25,748
Oh, you've still got plenty of friends. 
Mr. Rhinestone and Mr. Zircon come to mind.

273
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:39,199
God, I can hardly hear myself think.

274
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:42,089
Drink? 
 No, I don't want a drink.

275
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:45,497
Wasn't that opening act awful?  
What a joke.

276
00:20:45,497 --> 00:20:47,394
Coke?  Yeah, sure,
 I'm in the mood.

277
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:51,020
I'll have some food. 
 Let's get a hot dog.

278
00:20:51,935 --> 00:20:54,413
Hot dog and a coke, please.

279
00:20:55,949 --> 00:20:59,817
"I Want To Hold Your Hand," 
that was music. / Wasn't it?

280
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:02,634
"She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah."

281
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:04,773
Now those were lyrics. 
/ Brilliant.

282
00:21:04,773 --> 00:21:07,979
Who can relate to a song 
"Dead and Bloated"?

283
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:11,042
Unless you've been to 
my mother's for Thanksgiving.

284
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:13,931
There you go, Miss Fine.
 / Oh, thanks.  Um, yummy.

285
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:16,676
I don't know. 
 I feel a thousand years old.

286
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:19,438
Try hiking up your underwear,
 pulling down your pants a little,

287
00:21:19,438 --> 00:21:21,600
then you'll fit right in.

288
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,085
Ha.  You first. 
/ Ha, ha, ha.

289
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:28,973
Well, I'll tell you, you want
 to feel young, hang out with Theo.

290
00:21:28,973 --> 00:21:30,989
Oh, I don't know, Miss Fine.

291
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:35,499
I think if you had played your cards right, 
it wouldn't have been long before
 you were a very wealthy woman.

292
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:40,472
Meanwhile, there are plenty of bimbos
 that grew old and died waiting for George Burns.

293
00:21:42,797 --> 00:21:45,823
I need someone
 I can share things with.

294
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:47,782
Thanks, I'm so parched.

295
00:21:47,782 --> 00:21:49,486
You know, you're
 absolutely right.

296
00:21:49,486 --> 00:21:53,013
A good relationship has to
 be about give and take.

297
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:54,871
Hum?
 / Oh, thank you.  Yeah.

298
00:21:55,152 --> 00:21:58,132
Besides, you have to have stuff
 you can have in common.

299
00:21:58,132 --> 00:22:03,554
Uh-huh.  Catsup and mustard, 
just the way I like it. / Oh, sure.

300
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:07,341
I hope I didn't break his little heart.
 / Um ...

301
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:11,443
Although he does have a couple of 
new valves in there.

302
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:15,925
Well, I wouldn't worry about it, Miss Fine. 
 He seems to have made a full recovery.

303
00:22:15,925 --> 00:22:19,462
He's probably with
 some really young chippie.

304
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:26,072
Cee Cee?

305
00:22:26,797 --> 00:22:29,914
It seems she's inherited 
your earrings, Miss Fine.

306
00:22:29,914 --> 00:22:31,881
Well, I've got news for her.

307
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:35,590
They're nothing without the necklace.

308
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,470
Ow! Ow!

309
00:22:48,673 --> 00:22:50,163
That's right, sweetie.

310
00:22:50,163 --> 00:22:54,171
Keep snapping that rubber band
 every time you think of the bear.

311
00:22:54,171 --> 00:22:57,289
It's called "negative reinforcement,"
 and it really works.

312
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:00,125
Yeah, but now my watch
 doesn't fit anymore.

313
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,254
Hey, tell me about it.  
When I quit smoking,

314
00:23:02,254 --> 00:23:08,182
I had a wrist that was the size of 
my Aunt Frida's ankle after
 she had salty fish.

315
00:23:08,758 --> 00:23:10,549
Are you ready? / Yeah.

316
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:16,153
Congratulations.  Today is
 the first day of the rest of your life.

317
00:23:16,153 --> 00:23:19,188
Hi, Gracie.

318
00:23:23,427 --> 00:23:26,741
Ah, we'll be right back.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
