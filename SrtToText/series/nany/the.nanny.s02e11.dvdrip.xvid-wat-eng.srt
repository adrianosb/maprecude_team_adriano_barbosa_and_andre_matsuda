1
00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:06,568
Oh, Niles, this is an excellent
 issue of "Vanity Fair."

2
00:00:06,568 --> 00:00:10,321
Oh, really?  What's in it?
 / Obsession ------

3
00:00:11,963 --> 00:00:14,458
oh, Safari ...

4
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:19,568
Mel Gibson ...

5
00:00:21,072 --> 00:00:24,276
He has a cologne?
 / No.

6
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:28,859
So now which one's Mr. Sheffield
 and which one's Miss Fine?

7
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,055
She named her hamster after me.
 / Oh ...

8
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:36,601
How can you tell them apart?
 / Fran's the fat one.

9
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:40,485
She's not fat. 
 She just has big hair.

10
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:43,514
Oh, no, Mr. Sheffield is 
fighting with Miss Fine.

11
00:00:43,514 --> 00:00:46,961
He's not fighting with her. 
 He's having -- / Mr. Sheffield,

12
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,909
get off of Miss Fine.  
Miss Fine has a headache.

13
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:54,978
Oh, look, Mr. Sheffield
 has already fallen asleep.

14
00:00:54,978 --> 00:00:58,064
Okay, kids, go bring Miss Fine
 upstairs and give her a chew stick.

15
00:00:58,064 --> 00:01:00,736
She's not satisfied.

16
00:01:00,736 --> 00:01:04,185
Miss Fine, this month's "Soap Opera
 Hair Magazine" has arrived.

17
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:07,031
The bigger is better issue? 
/ Uh-huh.  With a free sample.

18
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:11,795
Oh, this is like Hanukkah in July.

19
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:14,813
Fran, I can't believe 
you're doing that?

20
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:18,735
Why, honey?  Did you think that 
I got this fullness naturally?

21
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:21,547
Oh, no.  This is just an outer shell.

22
00:01:21,547 --> 00:01:24,765
Inside I've got gel,
 mousse, volumizer.

23
00:01:24,765 --> 00:01:28,700
There's a whole infrastructure
 going on in there.

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,558
The only difference between me
 and the kingdom is AstroTurf.

25
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:35,683
Fran, don't you care
 about ecology?

26
00:01:35,683 --> 00:01:39,709
There are chemicals in here that are
 unsafe.  Some of that stuff is toxic.

27
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:45,048
Honey, you want to clean up toxic waste,
 start with Brighten's bathroom.

28
00:01:45,436 --> 00:01:50,866
Fran, I'm serious.  Give me that. 
/ Oh, no, no, I didn't do the tendrils yet.

29
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:54,185
Oh, boy, I'm getting
 a weird flashback here

30
00:01:54,185 --> 00:02:00,635
only you're me and I'm my mother.
 / What are you talking about?

31
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:04,406
I was young too once,
 out to save the world.

32
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:10,079
So you were like an activist 
in the "60s? / '70s, late.

33
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:13,757
Nuclear power, animal rights,
 cyclamates. / Cyclamates?

34
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:18,531
Oh, yeah, it was a big controversy. 
 Lemon Tang was never the same.

35
00:03:10,012 --> 00:03:14,934
Mr. Sheffield, if you were my cousin Marsha
 and you saw me in this dress, what would you do?

36
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:18,190
I'd, ah, tell you
 you looked fabulous

37
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,521
and then trash you the moment
 you left the room.

38
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:22,931
And?

39
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:28,172
And, um, eat an entire Sara Lee
 pound cake? / There you go.

40
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:31,929
For a minute there I thought 
I was going to have to change.

41
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:34,295
Isn't it a little sedate 
for you, Nanny Fine?

42
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:39,060
You don't look like you're trying to get
 a sailor to buy you a champagen cocktail.

43
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:44,228
Where you headed?  A funeral?

44
00:03:44,228 --> 00:03:49,693
As a matter of fact, I am.  
My great Aunt Mema Fager.  She was 104.

45
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:54,298
Oh ... well, how'd she die? 
/ Childbirth.

46
00:03:57,855 --> 00:04:00,110
Fran, tell dad he's
being totally unfair.

47
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,003
Mr. Sheffield, 
you're being totally unfair.

48
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:05,075
What is it I'm trying
 to get him to do again?

49
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:08,787
Mark and I want to go to an all-night, 
save-the-earth poetry reading.

50
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:14,793
Oh, right, what's the big deal?  Maggie and Mark
 want to go to an all-night save-the-earth -- all night?

51
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:20,211
Oh, honey, kiss it off. / Fran, they're
 having a candlelight vigil for animal rights.

52
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:24,947
Oh, that reminds me, I gotta 
pick up the pastrami platter.

53
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:29,908
You know if it sits too long,
 it gets that rainbow batina thing happening.

54
00:04:30,782 --> 00:04:34,480
I can't believe you.  Is this 
what happens when you turn when 21?

55
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,678
21 ...

56
00:04:37,383 --> 00:04:40,354
Don't mock the child, Niles.

57
00:04:40,354 --> 00:04:44,745
Look, Maggie, why don't you and your friends
 take it in turns to save the planet?  Hum?

58
00:04:44,745 --> 00:04:49,444
You could take the day shift and then someone
 whose parents are out of town could take the night.

59
00:04:49,444 --> 00:04:52,361
Oh, fine.  I'll go stand 
in the hole in the ozone layer.

60
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:55,393
Be sure to wear sun block.

61
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:58,500
Well, Miss Fine, it's refreshing 
to have you on my side for a change.

62
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:05,276
Oh, that.  I read somewhere that the primary-care
 giver should always agree with the guy that writes the checks.

63
00:05:05,276 --> 00:05:06,886
Uh-huh.  Thank you for your support.

64
00:05:06,886 --> 00:05:11,338
But for your information, I am too young 
to be on the pig side of a generation gap.

65
00:05:11,338 --> 00:05:16,274
Huff and puff as much as you like, Miss Fine.
  This little piggy is not letting her go.

66
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,202
That doesn't mean I'm not thrilled 
Margaret has a social conscience.

67
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:21,582
I just wish there were 
more people like her.

68
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:26,614
Oh, aren't the elephant tusks exquisite.

69
00:05:27,678 --> 00:05:32,332
They came from that cute
 little poacher in Kenya.

70
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,278
And here I thought you'd had 
your wisdom teeth pulled.

71
00:05:37,474 --> 00:05:39,811
So when you're watching "Gorillas
 in the Mist," you're thinking

72
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:44,367
in a fajita, I bet they're not so bad.

73
00:05:49,946 --> 00:05:52,599
It was a gorgeous funeral.

74
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:58,871
Ah, Mema Fager didn't look so hot.
  May she rest in piece.

75
00:05:59,081 --> 00:06:03,644
She could never pull it together
 from a special occasion.

76
00:06:03,644 --> 00:06:08,445
You know, when my time comes,
 I don't want no open casket.

77
00:06:08,445 --> 00:06:12,682
I don't trust no one to 
put on my makeup but me.

78
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:24,125
How's the corned beef?
 / Fatty, Daddy.  No good.

79
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,660
What do you do when you like something?
  Eat the Corning Ware?

80
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,096
So when are you due? 
/ Grandma, I'm not pregnant.

81
00:06:32,096 --> 00:06:35,028
So stop eating.

82
00:06:35,158 --> 00:06:41,483
Morty, turn the set down. 
 We're mourning in here.

83
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:44,287
Meanwhile, explain to me
 green carnations on a casket.

84
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:46,606
St. Patty didn't drop dead.

85
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:50,989
Why didn't their side spend
 a little on flowers like we did.

86
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:53,579
Syl, their side never
 did as well as us.

87
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,823
What well?  My daughter's a maid.

88
00:06:56,823 --> 00:06:59,649
Nanny, Ma.

89
00:07:02,948 --> 00:07:07,589
Meanwhile, I wonder who got 
the coat. / What coat?

90
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:13,384
Mema's mink.  She slept with it more 
than she slept with Oscar.

91
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:16,129
Mema's husband's name was Louie.

92
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:20,463
Yeah.  So where are
 you not following me?

93
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,472
Oh, well, I guess it wasn't the mortician 
that put that smile on her face.

94
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:30,564
Maybe we should see what's 
in the envelope uncle Dave gave us.

95
00:07:30,564 --> 00:07:33,132
I think it's a copy of the will.

96
00:07:33,132 --> 00:07:36,550
You know, I always offered 
to drive her to her checkups,

97
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,903
even after the bladder went.

98
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,982
Save it, Marsha.  It's already written.

99
00:07:42,982 --> 00:07:46,536
She's not coming back with an erasure.

100
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:50,630
Aunt Frita got Mema's diamond
 wedding ring. / Ahhhhhh ...

101
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,529
I wanted that.

102
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:57,740
Cousin Judy got the blender.
 / Ahhhhhh ...

103
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,625
I could have used that.

104
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,869
Uncle Morey got the pasta machine.
 / Ahhhhhh ....

105
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:07,846
That they could have.

106
00:08:07,846 --> 00:08:11,331
Who cares about their side.  
Let's get to our side.

107
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:14,086
Their side, our side. 
 Who's keeping score?

108
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:19,776
Meanwhile, it's three zip. 
/ Oh, please, Ma, calm down.

109
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:24,368
You're svitzing already.  
Soon you're going to slide off the couch.

110
00:08:24,368 --> 00:08:27,226
This is such a trying time for me.

111
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:32,135
Life won't be the same without
 my beloved Mema. / Shut up, Marsha.

112
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:38,043
"And the coat goes to Fran Fine."  
Come on down.

113
00:08:38,253 --> 00:08:42,117
I won the coat?  I won.  I won.

114
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,520
May she rest in peace.

115
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,748
She gave Fran the coat?

116
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:53,168
Who schlepped her to the beauty parlor
 every week to get her three hairs set?

117
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:55,889
Who smeared her with BenGay
 after shuffle board,

118
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:59,981
and after she got the hammer toe 
fixed, who lugged her around?

119
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:03,147
My husband, that's who.

120
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,007
Well, you can keep the coat
 because I don't want it.

121
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:09,269
What are you nuts?  Why?

122
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:13,134
Ma, I only wear fake fur.
  And do you know why?

123
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:18,187
Yes.  Because no one ever died
 and left you a real one before.

124
00:09:18,187 --> 00:09:21,693
No.  I have a very impressionable
 teenager at home that needs to know

125
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:26,079
that I stick by my beliefs,
 and I believe in animal rights.

126
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:32,952
Fran, a mink is not an animal. 
 It's a rodent.

127
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:38,950
If it was up in the attic, you would
 be the first one to call Terminex.

128
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:44,052
Ma, knock it off.  I'm not putting
 a dead animal anywhere near me.

129
00:09:44,052 --> 00:09:47,162
Pass the tongue.

130
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:51,471
Fran, you're keeping the coat. 
/ No, I'm not.

131
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:54,608
And do we have to discuss this
 in front of everyone?

132
00:09:54,608 --> 00:09:57,245
No, we'll discuss it in there.
 / Fine.

133
00:09:57,245 --> 00:10:00,297
Excuse us.

134
00:10:00,563 --> 00:10:04,080
They don't want to talk in front of us.

135
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,377
How could you turn your back on everything
 that I raised you to believe in?

136
00:10:09,377 --> 00:10:11,311
This is mink.

137
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:15,172
Ma, if you love the mink so much, 
why don't you keep it?

138
00:10:15,172 --> 00:10:17,729
I'm too busty.

139
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:21,897
Didn't stop you from wearing 
a tube top to Temple.

140
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,441
It's reform.

141
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:31,599
Ma, forget it. 
 I'm not taking the coat.

142
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:34,926
You know, you're killing 
me with this.

143
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:39,186
If I die tonight, 
you'll never forgive yourself.

144
00:10:39,186 --> 00:10:43,550
Ma, I'm a grown woman.  You can't use
 guilt on me anymore to get what you want.

145
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,229
Oh! / What's the matter, Ma?

146
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:52,327
Nothing.  I just hope I'm not getting 
that weird flesh-eating disease.

147
00:11:00,468 --> 00:11:03,008
We couldn't hear.

148
00:11:08,547 --> 00:11:09,804
Niles ... / Huh?

149
00:11:09,804 --> 00:11:13,836
Did my mother call? / Well, I'm not sure.
  There was one call --

150
00:11:13,836 --> 00:11:20,336
a sob, a sigh, and 
a long plaintive oy ...

151
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:27,909
Well, either that's her or AT & T is really
 depressed that we switched to Sprint.

152
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:32,102
I can't believe she would stoop 
to crank guilt calls.

153
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:38,071
How low can she go? / Hey, you're talking 
about a woman that could grow a tumor on command.

154
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:42,928
Ha, ha, ha.  Excuse me. 
/ Well, it's not going to work.

155
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:45,937
I'm a grown woman. 
 I'm entitled to my own opinions,

156
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:50,602
and no silent treatment is going to 
make me compromise my ideals.

157
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:55,169
That coat is staying in Queens.
 / Thank you.

158
00:11:55,956 --> 00:12:00,432
Oh, can you believe her.  Didn't she hear
 a word I said? I don't want this disgusting

159
00:12:00,432 --> 00:12:06,887
soft, lush, plush -- oh, Niles,
 did you see the satin lining?

160
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:10,437
Boy, they don't make them like that anymore.
 / Well, it does become you, Miss Fine.

161
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:16,582
Oh, no, Niles, it's absolutely
 repulsive.  I can't stand it.

162
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:20,421
Up or down.  Oh, take it off me. 
 Take it off.

163
00:12:20,421 --> 00:12:25,293
Oh, look, at the initials, 
M.F., Mema Fager --

164
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:29,168
Miss Fine, like it was meant to be.

165
00:12:29,168 --> 00:12:32,840
Well, you could always send 
it to Morgan Freeman.

166
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:39,905
Oh, Mema.  It smells just like her, 
Chalimar and stuffed cabbage?

167
00:12:39,905 --> 00:12:44,009
I remember when I was a little girl in the winter. 
 She would bundle me up in her coat with her,

168
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:49,944
her bosoms right on top of my head.
 My ears never got cold.

169
00:12:49,944 --> 00:12:57,475
I looked like Princess Laya until 
Mema got older.  Then I looked like Goofy.

170
00:12:57,475 --> 00:13:01,915
Funny, as a lad, I don't ever recall 
wearing bosoms as a hat.

171
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:06,740
Although, once at a butlers' convention -- 
/ Don't take me there, Niles.

172
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:11,430
Oh, my God.  Fran, what is
 that dead animal? / Where?  Where?

173
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:17,230
On your back. / Oh, this.  
Oh, I inherited this, but I refused to accept it.

174
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,132
Then why are you wearing it?

175
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,851
Ah, I'm just indulging Niles. 
 He wanted to see me in it.

176
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:26,504
All right, already, are you happy?
  Can I take it off?  Geez.

177
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:32,688
Niles, I'm surprised at you.
 / Oh, forgive me, Miss Margaret.
  I'm such a beast

178
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:41,218
Good morning, everyone ...  But Dad.

179
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,812
Niles, thank you so much for buying glass 
bottles instead of plastic ones at the market.

180
00:13:46,812 --> 00:13:51,564
My pleasure, Miss Margaret.  I've always
 wanted to know what a hernia felt like.

181
00:13:53,226 --> 00:13:55,654
Aren't you joining us, Maggie?
 / Oh, no.

182
00:13:55,654 --> 00:14:00,366
While you leisurely sit here and eat, hundreds
 of acres of rain forest are being destroyed.

183
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:03,100
So you're taking your croissant
 back to the biosphere.

184
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,155
Sit down, Margaret.

185
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:09,007
Hello, hello. 
/ Oh, Cee Cee, care to join us?

186
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:12,916
Well, is there enough? 
/ No. / Niles ...

187
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:18,166
Well, it's just that you know how
 I feel about her eating inside.

188
00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:23,325
What was that? / I asked what
 she would like on the side.

189
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:26,998
Bacon, sausage, Mighty Dog?

190
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:30,381
Whoa!

191
00:14:35,664 --> 00:14:40,174
Oh, it's so nice sitting here with 
all of you.  I feel like part of the family.

192
00:14:40,402 --> 00:14:43,070
Good morning, Stacy.

193
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:46,322
Gracie.
 / Thank you  ...

194
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:49,246
Brighten.

195
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:54,840
So, kids, what's new? 
/ Miss Fine's having a baby.

196
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,046
What? 
/ Who's the father?

197
00:14:57,046 --> 00:15:00,701
Why, Mr. Sheffield of course.

198
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:07,203
Miss Fine, what on earth is all
 this about you being pregnant?

199
00:15:07,203 --> 00:15:10,409
Pregnant?  Me? 
 Oh, that's impossible.

200
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,091
Well, it's not impossible.

201
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:17,074
Oh, yeah, it's impossible.

202
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:22,617
Miss Fine and Mr. Sheffield are hamsters.
 / Oh, I knew I left something out.

203
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:25,588
Oh, please, no animals in the dining room.

204
00:15:25,588 --> 00:15:31,625
I will be in the office. / Oh, very good, sir. 
Usually, I have to tug at her leash.

205
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:36,125
Niles, has my mother called yet?
 / No, I'm afraid not.

206
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:42,034
Oh, Miss Fine, why don't you just take
 the blasted coat and have done with it. / No ...

207
00:15:42,034 --> 00:15:45,096
Why can't Fran have an opinion 
different than her mother's.

208
00:15:45,096 --> 00:15:48,367
Children should have the right to make 
their own decisions and live their own lives.

209
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,312
You can have any opinion you like, Maggie,

210
00:15:50,312 --> 00:15:55,873
just don't have it in the park 
after dark with Mark. Oh, there's your poetry.

211
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:58,925
Now you don't have to go.
 / Oh ...

212
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:03,012
Oh, come on, Miss Fine, how'd you
 make up with your mother in the past?

213
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:04,766
Well, when I was a little girl,

214
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:09,535
I would put a napkin on my head 
and sing "Sunrise, Sunset."

215
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:15,831
At eight it's adorable.  At 30, 
they're giving you 3,000 units of Thorazine.

216
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:17,630
Well, if there's anything I can do.

217
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,621
Well, now that you mention it, 
couldn't you talk to her, please.

218
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:24,894
I man you're so handsome, diplomatic.

219
00:16:24,894 --> 00:16:28,556
What does that have to do with anything?
 / Well, my mother responds to good looks.

220
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:33,755
She always said you reminded her of
 Dave from Alvin and the Chipmunks.

221
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,773
The cartoon? / Yeah.  She had 
a thing for George Jetson too,

222
00:16:37,773 --> 00:16:41,141
but he's a little more goyish.

223
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:49,422
Oh, Niles, isn't Mr. Sheffield a doll for going to 
all the trouble of inviting my mother here for dinner?

224
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:53,306
Yes.  He's really knocked himself out.

225
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:57,175
Did you stock the bar? 
/ Yes, Miss Fine, we have Chevitz, Pins, Schnider

226
00:16:57,175 --> 00:16:59,917
-- what does Sylvia like to drink? 
/ Diet Slice.

227
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:05,319
Oh, will Fresca do? / No, it doesn't 
have to the zest of lime in it.

228
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,211
Fine, now I'm going to have to go out ... 
 Hi. / Oh, Miss Fine.

229
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:12,229
Oh, this should be
 an interesting dinner, sir.

230
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:15,561
Miss Fine and her mother not speaking, 
Miss Margaret not speaking to you.

231
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:21,410
That will leave the bulk of the conversation
 to you and Sylvia. / Oh, good God.

232
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,873
Well, perhaps you can swap stories. 
 You can tell her how you started in the theater,

233
00:17:24,873 --> 00:17:29,037
and she can tell you how 
she removes unwanted hair.

234
00:17:29,037 --> 00:17:30,868
For heaven sakes, we've got to 
get someone else for dinner.

235
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:33,683
Well, it is Saturday night, sir,
 and most people do have a life.

236
00:17:33,683 --> 00:17:36,992
Well, I'm off. 
/ Ha, ha, ha, ha.

237
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,122
Cee Cee, by any chance are 
you free tonight?

238
00:17:40,122 --> 00:17:44,028
No.  I have to pick up 
my grandfather from the airport.

239
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:49,709
Old thing's in wheelchair with
 a respirator -- why?

240
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:53,376
Well, I was just wondering if you'd care 
to join me for dinner? / Done.  Love too.

241
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:56,202
What about, what about your grandfather?
 / Oh, he'll get a sky cap.

242
00:17:56,202 --> 00:17:59,695
He's loaded.  He'll put a 20 
in his mouth and wave it.

243
00:17:59,695 --> 00:18:02,670
No, no.  I just can't do this.
 / Oh, no, no, no, Maxwell. 
 It's not a problem.

244
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06,220
The old guy's in a wheelchair.  
It's downhill from La Guardia.

245
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,432
No, you see, it won't be just us. 
 I'm afraid Miss Fine and her mother will be there.

246
00:18:10,432 --> 00:18:13,334
Oh, I hate that woman.

247
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:16,248
Which one? / Pick.

248
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:21,790
Really?  Sylvia's always saying what a beautiful,
 charming, sophisticated woman of the world you are.

249
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,542
Really?  Those were her exact words?

250
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:29,054
Oh, that reminds me.  I have to get 
the name of your manicurist.

251
00:18:29,054 --> 00:18:32,758
Sylvia's always going on about 
how beautifully young your hands look.

252
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:35,308
I've always adored Syl.

253
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:38,234
But if you have a more pressing engagement,
 then of course -- / Forget about gramps.

254
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:41,484
I'll call the airline.  They'll stick
 him where they put the skis.

255
00:18:41,484 --> 00:18:47,873
Niles, another place sitting on the table
 and make it right next to my pal Syl.

256
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:51,716
Get the name of your manicurist indeed.

257
00:18:51,716 --> 00:18:55,250
I learned from the master. 
/ Yeah, well ...

258
00:18:56,475 --> 00:19:00,240
Aren't my hamsters cute?  We named
 the babies Maggie, Brighten, and Grace.

259
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,607
There was a Cee Cee,
 but Miss Fine ate her.

260
00:19:05,122 --> 00:19:09,301
Isn't that adorable.

261
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:12,733
The kid collects vermin.

262
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:17,038
Syl ...  Is that you?

263
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,521
Yeah.  I was invited.

264
00:19:20,521 --> 00:19:24,334
Shame on you girl friend.

265
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,453
Why haven't we done lunch?

266
00:19:28,453 --> 00:19:33,386
Because when you saw me eat a chicken,
 you had to take an Advil.

267
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:36,820
Oh, hi, Ma.  What a nice surprise.

268
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,992
Gee, I didn't know
 Mr. Sheffield invited you for dinner.

269
00:19:39,992 --> 00:19:44,870
You want a diet Slice? 
/ No, thanks.  It gases me up.

270
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,183
Come on, sisealla.

271
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:54,490
Oh, this ring is stunning.
 / My aunt gave it to me.

272
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,824
Oh, it's a family heirloom.

273
00:19:56,824 --> 00:20:02,142
How nice of you to not throw it 
back in your aunt's face.

274
00:20:02,142 --> 00:20:06,620
Ma, would you cut me some slack?
 / Why won't you wear a stinking coat.

275
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:12,372
You watch your tone of voice, young lady.
 / Oh, I'm sorry.  I couldn't help it.

276
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:15,027
Not you, Ma.  
He's talking to Maggie.

277
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:18,243
Maggie does nothing. 
 She's a good daughter.

278
00:20:18,243 --> 00:20:21,572
And what am I?  Patty Davis?

279
00:20:21,572 --> 00:20:26,139
This is just like when you refused 
the mother-daughter kaftans that I bought us.

280
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:28,818
Six years old and a turban?

281
00:20:28,818 --> 00:20:31,605
That's it.  I wash my hands of you.

282
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:35,381
Oh, Mr. Sheffield. / Oh, oh, she's getting away.  
Niles, the napkin. / No.  Oh, no.

283
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:38,804
Yes, Miss Fine, yes, yes. 
/ Oh, no, no, no.

284
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:44,756
"Is this the little girl I carried?"

285
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:51,037
Fran, that's not fair. 
/ "Is this the little boy at play?"

286
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:57,708
Bomb, boom, bomb.
 / "I don't remember growing older."

287
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:02,730
"When did they?"

288
00:21:03,631 --> 00:21:07,664
Oh, Fran, I'm sorry. 
/ I'm sorry too, Mom.

289
00:21:07,664 --> 00:21:10,935
Oh, Syl ...

290
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:13,916
Oh, please, it's over.

291
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,612
Miss Babcock TWA is on the phone.

292
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:21,432
It seems there's an unclaimed elderly 
gentleman on Carrousel 5. / Oh ...

293
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,703
Oh, Ma, I don't want to fight anymore.

294
00:21:25,703 --> 00:21:30,489
Me neither.  It's just such 
an honor that Mema chose you.

295
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,966
She came to this country
 with nothing.

296
00:21:32,966 --> 00:21:35,506
She worked, she sacrificed.

297
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:39,922
This coat symbolizes
 the struggles of our family.

298
00:21:39,922 --> 00:21:44,455
Ma, she won it
 on the "Price is Right."

299
00:21:46,244 --> 00:21:48,230
Fran, you should keep the coat.

300
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,762
After all, you're the one who always
 says family comes first.

301
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:55,182
Oh, all right.  I'll keep the coat.

302
00:21:55,182 --> 00:21:58,304
Oh, I never thought
 I'd hear you say those words.

303
00:21:58,304 --> 00:22:01,798
But just in case,
 I got it right here.

304
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:04,030
Oh, but I can't wear it.

305
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,897
All right, maybe just around 
my Cousin Marsha

306
00:22:06,897 --> 00:22:12,687
because it will kill her, and then 
at least the minks won't have died in vain.

307
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:17,175
And, Dad, as important as 
this poetry meeting is to me,

308
00:22:17,175 --> 00:22:22,829
if you really don't want me to go,
 then I'll respect your decision.

309
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:26,934
I really don't want you to go. 
/ Why not?

310
00:22:28,308 --> 00:22:34,036
That is the most beautiful coat
 I have ever seen.

311
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:36,480
I'll give you $10,000 for it right now.

312
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,927
Oh, no, I'm sorry.  This coat --
/ Looks better on a blond.
