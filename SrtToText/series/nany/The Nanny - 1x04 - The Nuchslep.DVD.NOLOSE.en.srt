1
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:08,503
Hey...

2
00:00:08,503 --> 00:00:10,949
Niles?  Are you okay?

3
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:14,626
Oh, I'm afraid
I'm feeling a bit queer.

4
00:00:14,626 --> 00:00:16,253
Don't ask.
Don't tell.

5
00:00:16,253 --> 00:00:19,975
But for god sakes,
come out of the closet.

6
00:00:20,717 --> 00:00:24,274
Oh, Miss Fine,
I'm beginning to feel a bit ill.

7
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,811
Oh, you British.

8
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:32,052
You look like us, you act like us,
but bottom line, you're foreigners.

9
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:34,611
C'mere, let me take
your temperature. / Huh?

10
00:00:35,186 --> 00:00:37,182
Ninety-nine point three.

11
00:00:37,182 --> 00:00:39,484
I must say, you have
very skillful lips.

12
00:00:39,484 --> 00:00:42,698
Oh, honey, you don't
know the half of it.

13
00:00:42,698 --> 00:00:47,795
Put this down, go upstairs,
lie down and rub on some Vicks.

14
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:50,352
I will let you know
when dinner's ready.

15
00:00:50,352 --> 00:00:52,032
You?
/ You?

16
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:56,562
Yes, me.
Now go, go.

17
00:00:56,562 --> 00:01:00,889
I'm perfectly capable of
getting dinner on the table.

18
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:04,726
Hello, Fung Lungs,
do you deliver?

19
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:09,012
Okay, well we want
the family dinner.  Yeah,

20
00:01:09,012 --> 00:01:12,213
I feel like shrimp.  Gracie,
honey, what do you feel like?

21
00:01:12,213 --> 00:01:14,865
I feel trapped.

22
00:01:15,962 --> 00:01:20,779
Maybe we should order
the Dysfunctional Family Dinner.

23
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:25,834
With that they promise you shrimp
and then they don't give it to you.

24
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:29,524
Niles? / Oh, hold on a minute.
The father may be joining us.

25
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:32,696
This could mean an upgrade
to the Imperial Feast.

26
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:34,850
What's, what's going on?
Where, where's Niles?

27
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,226
Oh, he's queer.
/ So we're doing take-out.

28
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:38,969
Take-out?

29
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:42,516
Well, I'm just trying to expose
the children to other cultures.

30
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:46,952
We ordered Chinese food,
they learn how Jewish people eat.

31
00:01:46,952 --> 00:01:49,750
You sure you wouldn't rather
take them to the Twenty-One Club?

32
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,680
Oh...

33
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,767
Oh now, kids,
if the man's insisting...

34
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:58,186
No, no, no.  You have
your fun and order Chinese.

35
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:00,038
Yes!
/ Okay.

36
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:03,974
Just make sure Grace gets
an optimistic fortune.

37
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:57,547
I don't care if you're
down to your last wok.

38
00:02:57,547 --> 00:03:00,901
We waited an hour
and a half for this food.

39
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:04,318
I should be hungry
again already.

40
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,635
Finally.
/ Oh, about time.

41
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:08,389
Yes!
/ Ling, this better be you.

42
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:13,568
Eddie?
/ Maggie!

43
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,425
I thought this house looked familiar.
/ Come on in.

44
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:18,408
Oh, I can't.  I have another
order to deliver.

45
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:23,051
Meanwhile I waited an hour
and a half.  What's their rush?

46
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:26,575
Are you that waiter that
kissed Maggie at Daddy's party?

47
00:03:26,575 --> 00:03:28,484
Good night, Gracie.

48
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:32,057
You know, Maggie never stops
talking about you. Sometimes... Ow!

49
00:03:32,057 --> 00:03:33,655
Fran, Maggie kicked me.

50
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:37,260
It wasn't Maggie.
Go, start without us.

51
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,985
Oh, this bag's greasy.
/ Mmm, extra flavor.

52
00:03:43,534 --> 00:03:47,400
So does your father still wanna
kill me for kissing you at the party?

53
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,758
Yeah.

54
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:53,968
Don't worry about him.
He knows it was just a kiss.

55
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,411
It wasn't just a kiss for me.

56
00:04:02,377 --> 00:04:04,307
You pay him,
give him a nice tip.

57
00:04:04,307 --> 00:04:08,229
But not too much. We don't want
him to think we're desperate.

58
00:04:10,906 --> 00:04:12,841
Would you go eat?

59
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:15,727
Don't be nosey.

60
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:20,244
Stuck to the door again,
Miss Fine?

61
00:04:20,244 --> 00:04:22,349
Niles... I'm the nanny.

62
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:26,181
I'm paid to watch the children.
Why aren't you sleeping?

63
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:31,580
I was, but I put on so much eucalyptus rub,
I dreamt I was attacked by a giant Koala.

64
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,313
You know, I had that same dream.

65
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,244
Now you're both scaring me.
Come on, have some won-ton.

66
00:04:40,244 --> 00:04:45,093
Now listen, kids, when Maggie comes out
I want you all to act like nothing happened.

67
00:04:45,093 --> 00:04:48,900
Please, nobody give her
the third degree.

68
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:51,739
Oh, tell me everything!
What did he say?

69
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:53,857
Did he ask you out?
/ Yes.

70
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:59,924
Where are you gonna go?
What are you gonna wear?
/ What are you gonna tell Dad?

71
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:06,500
Maxwell, I thought we were going
to meet at Le Circ.
Why the sudden change in plans?

72
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,882
I have a special birthday present
for you, and I just couldn't wait.

73
00:05:09,882 --> 00:05:12,226
You didn't have
to get me anything.

74
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:15,410
Well, all right, forget it.
/ Maxwell, you beast!

75
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,840
C.C.

76
00:05:17,686 --> 00:05:21,309
C.C., now you've been
alone too long.

77
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:24,730
A lovely woman like you should
have someone to come home to.

78
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,604
Someone, someone who loves you.

79
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:30,632
Maxwell...

80
00:05:30,632 --> 00:05:34,128
Just close your eyes
and put out your hand.

81
00:05:42,987 --> 00:05:45,210
An engagement dog?

82
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,837
I, I beg your pardon?

83
00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:49,859
What an engaging dog!

84
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:54,412
Oh, Maxwell, how thoughtful.

85
00:05:57,605 --> 00:06:00,835
Stock A, and a good judge of character.

86
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:04,327
Well, he needs some time
to get used to you.

87
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:07,911
I mean, you can't expect a dog
to just jump into your arms
and love you at first sight.

88
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:09,272
Mister Sheffield?

89
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:14,691
Oh, you got her a puppy.
Oh, how sweet.

90
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:18,275
Oh, look how friendly he is.

91
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:23,002
Oh, look he's like a little chestnut.
You should call him Chester.

92
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:26,731
If you don't 'mind, he's my dog,
I'll name him.

93
00:06:29,568 --> 00:06:32,297
Chester it is.

94
00:06:32,297 --> 00:06:36,237
Maxwell, I don't know how to
thank you for this lovely gift.

95
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:39,944
I think I'll just take him
home and put him to sleep.

96
00:06:39,944 --> 00:06:42,942
You mean to bed. / Whatever.

97
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:44,914
Maxwell, I'll meet you
at the restaurant.

98
00:06:44,914 --> 00:06:49,330
Bye, Chester.
Bye, little Chester.  Bye, bye.

99
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,688
You should have gotten
her the toaster oven.

100
00:06:54,688 --> 00:06:57,655
Yes, Miss Fine,
is this a social call?

101
00:06:57,655 --> 00:07:01,631
Um, well, I do have a little problem
I need to discuss with you.

102
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,166
It's not really a problem,
so much as it is a dilemma.

103
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,195
No, that has
a negative connotation.

104
00:07:07,195 --> 00:07:09,405
Miss Fine, I do have
dinner reservations.

105
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:10,995
Oh, well I'm getting to it.

106
00:07:10,995 --> 00:07:14,289
Maggie was asked out
on a date tomorrow.

107
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:17,404
Oh, that's not a problem.
Just tell her no.

108
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:20,002
Hence the dilemma.

109
00:07:20,002 --> 00:07:21,119
You said yes?

110
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:23,669
Well, it's just a movie.
A cartoon yet.

111
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:28,665
How could you do that?
I mean, who is this boy?
Do I, do I know him?

112
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:32,130
Does anybody really know anybody?

113
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:34,223
You're trying my patience.

114
00:07:34,223 --> 00:07:37,622
Oh, all right.  It was Eddie
from the backers party you threw.

115
00:07:37,622 --> 00:07:39,751
Eddie the kissing waiter?

116
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,413
Well, he's also
a delivery boy.

117
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:46,368
It was fate, I tell you.
He delivered the take-out.

118
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:51,095
He's saving up to go to Yale,
and I'm not talking about
the locksmith school either.

119
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,412
Yale?  Really?
/ Hm-hmm.

120
00:07:53,412 --> 00:07:58,718
So what's he going to study?
/ Study?  Um...

121
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:04,061
Llamas?

122
00:08:04,061 --> 00:08:05,714
Drama.

123
00:08:05,714 --> 00:08:07,332
Drama?

124
00:08:07,332 --> 00:08:09,978
So my daughter wants
to date an actor?

125
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:11,738
Where did I go wrong?

126
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:16,607
Oh, if you could have only seen the way
those two kids looked at each other.

127
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:19,312
Oh well, maybe it's better
you didn't.

128
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:22,502
Miss Fine, you see the position
you've put me in.

129
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:27,227
Now you're the good guy,
and I'm the ogre who won't let
his daughter go to the ball.

130
00:08:27,227 --> 00:08:30,326
Oh, nobody thinks of it that way.

131
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:34,650
I mean, maybe the word
ogre was mentioned.

132
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,627
You can't shelter her forever.
I mean, boys will come knocking,

133
00:08:38,627 --> 00:08:42,787
and if you don't let 'em
in the front door, she is gonna
start sneaking out the window.

134
00:08:42,787 --> 00:08:47,260
I have seen it a hundred times.
Take Teresa Palelly...

135
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,572
Teresa Palelly the casting director?
/ You know her?

136
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:55,423
Well, I've used her.
/ And the legend lives on.

137
00:08:56,184 --> 00:09:00,287
Oh, very well, Miss Fine,
Margaret may go on her date.

138
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:02,855
Oh, thank you,
Mister Sheffield.

139
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:06,394
Goodnight, Miss Fine.
/ Goodnight, Mister Sheffield.

140
00:09:06,394 --> 00:09:09,432
Enjoy the movie tomorrow.
/ What?  I'm not going.

141
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:12,753
Oh, yes, you are.
You're going to chaperon.

142
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:16,065
Chaperon?  Is that
even still a word?

143
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:20,554
Ogres still use it.
/ Oh, why do I have to be the nuchslep?

144
00:09:20,554 --> 00:09:25,604
The what shelp? / The nuchshlep.

145
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:30,888
The tag-along.
The pathetic loser living
on the cusp of other people's lives.

146
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:35,504
Oh, I'm sure you'll
catch on quickly.

147
00:09:35,504 --> 00:09:37,132
So what did he say?
Yes or no?

148
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:40,368
Yes.  But you're not
gonna like the fine print.

149
00:09:40,368 --> 00:09:42,657
I have to go with you.

150
00:09:42,657 --> 00:09:46,775
So what you're saying is that
on my first date alone
with a gorgeous guy,

151
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:50,544
you're gonna be sitting right
next to me? / You got it.

152
00:09:50,544 --> 00:09:52,859
Thank God.

153
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,712
Oh, let's try this.

154
00:10:05,712 --> 00:10:07,979
Um, excuse us.

155
00:10:07,979 --> 00:10:09,919
Would you mind moving down a seat?

156
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:12,575
There's two seats there.
/ Yeah, but we're three.

157
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:14,533
Her date is getting
our refreshments.

158
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:17,141
If she's on a date,
who are you?

159
00:10:17,141 --> 00:10:22,074
The chaperon.
/ Oh, move down for the nuchshlep.

160
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:25,412
Looks too young
to be a nuchshlep.

161
00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:30,032
You don't have to be old,
you just have to be a loser.

162
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:33,157
Are you two gonna talk
through the whole movie?

163
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:38,883
So how do you think it's going?
/ Nice.  Very nice.

164
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:41,233
So, you don't think
I'm being too quiet?

165
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:45,903
Oh, you know, let me give you
a little bit of advice.

166
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:49,708
Remember when Eddie came
to the house and you said, 'Hello'?

167
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:53,896
Uh-huh. / That was good.
Elaborate on that.

168
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:57,687
Well, how?
/ Honey, it's your first date.

169
00:10:57,687 --> 00:11:00,209
Why don't you just
relax and enjoy it?

170
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:06,237
Oy, I remember my first date.
Robbie Ortoff, the Falmingo Beach Club.

171
00:11:06,237 --> 00:11:07,474
What she say?

172
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:12,614
She's talking about
the old days when she had a life.

173
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:18,132
Do you mind?  I'm trying
to tell a story here.

174
00:11:18,132 --> 00:11:23,051
Oh, the nuchshlep's getting annoyed.

175
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:25,817
So you didn't know what
to say on your first date either?

176
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:28,795
Oh, no, honey.  But I got
the gift of gab.

177
00:11:28,795 --> 00:11:33,900
The point is, you gotta be
yourself, too.  Only louder.

178
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,462
Hi.

179
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,126
Hello!

180
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:42,955
I got popcorn.
/ I love popcorn!

181
00:11:42,955 --> 00:11:44,484
Here's your soda.

182
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:48,440
Oy, look at the size of this thing.
It should come with a lifeguard.

183
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,382
Yeah, I think mine
has an undertow.

184
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:58,203
Yeah, my soda's so big...

185
00:11:58,503 --> 00:12:01,945
I don't think I'll
be able to drink it all.

186
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:06,347
It's really big.

187
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:10,614
********************

188
00:12:15,678 --> 00:12:19,470
It is so good to see you back
again on your feet, Niles.
/ Thank you, sir.

189
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,623
I've prepared your favorite,
Belgian Waffles.

190
00:12:22,623 --> 00:12:27,598
I don't recall them being my favorite.
/ Oh, then they must be mine.

191
00:12:27,598 --> 00:12:32,088
It was my grandfather's recipe,
served at the coronation breakfast
of George the Sixth.

192
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:34,985
Mmm... Eggos.

193
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:39,003
Belgian Waffles, Miss Fine.
/ Mmm, very close.

194
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:44,480
So, Maggie, you haven't told us
about your date last night.

195
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,484
Maggie dear,
your hair's in the syrup.

196
00:12:47,484 --> 00:12:49,917
We had a wonderful time.

197
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:53,495
It was terrible.  I didn't have
anything to say.  I sat there like a lump.

198
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:58,342
Well, so do mash potatoes and
everybody likes them.

199
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:02,289
Maggie, you were great.
She's a regular riot.

200
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:05,742
Remember that really funny thing
that you said about the egg cream?

201
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:08,602
That was you.
/ Oh.

202
00:13:08,602 --> 00:13:13,243
How 'bout that really funny joke
you said about this guy and his turban?

203
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:15,279
You.
/ Oh.

204
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,215
Well, how 'bout...
/ You!  You!  You!  You!  You!

205
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:22,024
Oh boy, was I on
last night or what?

206
00:13:22,024 --> 00:13:24,401
Well, I'm sure it'll
go better next time.

207
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:27,373
There won't be a next time because
I'm never gonna see him again.

208
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,719
Because I'm a worthless,
pathetic, unlovable nothing.

209
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:33,698
Can I have your waffles?

210
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:36,399
Sweetheart, don't be
so down on yourself.

211
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,463
Maggie, you have so much to offer.
I'm sure that's Eddie probably right now.

212
00:13:41,463 --> 00:13:43,997
Yeah, right.
/ It's Master Eddie.

213
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:49,306
There.  What did I tell you?
/ I'm afraid it's not for
Miss Margaret.  It's for you.

214
00:13:49,306 --> 00:13:50,939
Me?
/ Yes.

215
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:54,165
You, you, you, you, you.

216
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:00,205
Hello?... Yeah?...

217
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:01,063
Uh-huh...

218
00:14:02,405 --> 00:14:03,609
Uh-huh...

219
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:05,499
Uh-huh...

220
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,192
Okay...

221
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:11,746
Bye, Eddie.

222
00:14:11,746 --> 00:14:13,342
Oh...

223
00:14:15,977 --> 00:14:18,297
Well?

224
00:14:18,297 --> 00:14:20,918
Eddie says hello.

225
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:23,634
And? / And he wants
to see me Friday night.

226
00:14:23,634 --> 00:14:26,910
Could you pass
the syrup, please?

227
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,151
Why don't you just take it
like you take everything else?

228
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:34,001
Margaret...
/ Is this sarcasm from Margaret?

229
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:36,484
Maggie, maybe we should
go talk somewhere?

230
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:40,205
Why don't you just talk to Eddie?
/ Yes, folks, it's definitely sarcasm.

231
00:14:40,205 --> 00:14:42,002
And Maggie scores again!
/ Shut-up, Brighton.

232
00:14:42,002 --> 00:14:45,370
Let's just everyone calm down.
/ No, let her vent.

233
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,443
It'll make her feel better.
It'll make us all feel better.

234
00:14:48,443 --> 00:14:52,802
I trusted you and you stole
my boyfriend!  I hate you!

235
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:57,151
Yeah, doesn't everybody
feel better now?

236
00:14:57,151 --> 00:14:59,539
I know I do.

237
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:07,743
Honey, it's Daddy.

238
00:15:07,743 --> 00:15:11,201
Look, if you come out of your room,
we'll go to Rumplemeyers for some ice cream.

239
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:15,186
Can't you just let me
die in peace?!

240
00:15:15,186 --> 00:15:19,450
Ice cream always used to work.
/ So did chaperoning.

241
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,202
What are you saying?
This is all my fault?

242
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:25,657
No, no, it's my fault for listening
to you in the first place.

243
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:28,043
I never should have gone
on that date.

244
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:30,984
Neither should Maggie.
But you pushed her into it.

245
00:15:30,984 --> 00:15:35,432
I didn't push her. / Trust me, you pushed.
You always push.  Push, push, push.

246
00:15:35,432 --> 00:15:39,171
Wait.  Are you implying that I push?

247
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,838
Niles, who's right here?

248
00:15:40,838 --> 00:15:44,042
This darn cold,
can't hear a thing.

249
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:47,444
Okay, so maybe I push.
But somebody has to.

250
00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:51,233
Haven't you ever seen the little
baby birds looking out over
the edge of their nest?

251
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:55,524
It's the mama bird that has to
push them into the world so
that they learn to fly.

252
00:15:55,524 --> 00:16:00,222
Haven't you ever seen those little
baby birds dead on the sidewalk?

253
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:02,751
One in ten, tops.

254
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:08,437
Well, if only you'd sat in the back
of the movie theater, like a proper nuchshlep.

255
00:16:08,437 --> 00:16:11,655
But no, you had to go be witty
and charming and make the boy like you.

256
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:13,788
Can I help it if I effervesce?

257
00:16:13,788 --> 00:16:18,008
Well must you make everyone like you?
Even the dog preferred you over C.C.

258
00:16:18,008 --> 00:16:21,210
Oh, now that was pure
animal instinct.

259
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,794
But it never happened
with the other nannies.

260
00:16:23,794 --> 00:16:26,719
With their sour dispositions
and chin whiskers.

261
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:30,195
Chin whiskers?
In the age of electrolysis?

262
00:16:30,195 --> 00:16:33,026
Oh, no excuse for that.

263
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:35,323
At least their boundaries were clear.

264
00:16:35,323 --> 00:16:38,946
I don't know, sometimes you seem
more like Maggie's girlfriend than her nanny.

265
00:16:38,946 --> 00:16:41,385
Her girlfriend.

266
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:45,940
Oh, Mister Sheffield,
you're a genius.

267
00:16:46,682 --> 00:16:51,144
What did I say?
/ Nothing very profound, sir.

268
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:55,731
I thought you couldn't hear?
/ It's a miracle.

269
00:16:59,112 --> 00:17:01,462
Go away!

270
00:17:01,462 --> 00:17:05,060
I couldn't hear you.
Did you say come in?

271
00:17:05,386 --> 00:17:07,909
No.  But do what you want.
You will anyway.

272
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:10,401
I brought you some Mallomars.

273
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:12,137
I'm too depressed to eat.

274
00:17:12,137 --> 00:17:16,352
Gee, I wish depression had
that effect on me.

275
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:18,757
Do you know how
humiliated I feel?

276
00:17:18,757 --> 00:17:23,699
Losing my boyfriend
to my nanny?

277
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:27,725
Honey, I think you're too
old to have a nanny.

278
00:17:27,725 --> 00:17:31,114
I mean, it's okay
for Brighton and Gracie,

279
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:35,402
but I'd like to think of you
and I more like friends.

280
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:39,007
Some friend.  Do friends steal
their friend's boyfriends?

281
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:42,805
Absolutely not.  I mean,
take me and Val.

282
00:17:42,805 --> 00:17:46,753
Sure there were plenty of times
when we would meet a guy,

283
00:17:46,753 --> 00:17:50,086
and she would fall in love with him,
and he would fall in love with me.

284
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:53,583
Or I would fall in love with him,
and he would fall in love with...

285
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,846
No, that never happened.

286
00:17:56,846 --> 00:18:00,552
The point is though, we never
let it ruin our friendship.

287
00:18:00,552 --> 00:18:05,033
And that's the Official
Girlfriend's Code.

288
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,483
The what?

289
00:18:07,483 --> 00:18:10,458
You never heard of
the Official Girlfriend's Code?

290
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,430
The OGC.

291
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,527
No.

292
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:18,205
Oy, what do they teach you
in those private schools?

293
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:22,354
Rule number one: You never
gossip about your best friend.

294
00:18:22,354 --> 00:18:26,813
A totally moronic rule
that nobody follows.

295
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:28,936
So we'll move on to
rule number two.

296
00:18:28,936 --> 00:18:31,255
If a girl falls for a guy

297
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:38,753
and the idiot guy falls for her
effervescent but totally blameless friend,

298
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:43,514
then the aforementioned friend
is obliged to dump him.

299
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:45,921
You would do that for me?

300
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:49,954
Honey, it's the OGC.

301
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:53,796
Maybe I will have one of
those Mallomars.

302
00:18:53,796 --> 00:18:55,959
Rule number three:
When it comes to chocolate,

303
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:58,881
it's every girl for herself.

304
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:04,351
Rule number twenty-seven:
Just because you're dumping someone,

305
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,733
doesn't mean you
shouldn't look your best.

306
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:09,363
Oh God, that's him.
What are we gonna do?

307
00:19:09,363 --> 00:19:12,543
Okay, don't worry.
I'll let him down gently.

308
00:19:12,543 --> 00:19:15,407
Destroy him.

309
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:17,242
All right. / Can I listen?

310
00:19:17,242 --> 00:19:21,059
Oh sure.  What do you think
the butler's pantry is for?

311
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:26,661
Just looking for a ladle.

312
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:29,475
Ah, here it is.

313
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,188
Hello, Ed. / Hi.

314
00:19:39,188 --> 00:19:41,345
I bought you some spare ribs.

315
00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:46,451
Oh, you are some little
operator, aren't you?

316
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,951
First you ask Maggie out on a date,

317
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:53,692
then you toy with her emotions,
now you're bringing me pork.

318
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:57,294
What are you, some kind of
delivering Don Juan?

319
00:19:57,294 --> 00:19:59,019
What are you talking about?

320
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:01,786
Us.  Me.  You.
It's not gonna happen.

321
00:20:01,786 --> 00:20:03,626
You think...?

322
00:20:04,015 --> 00:20:06,111
Miss Fine, you're old enough
to be my... / Watch it.

323
00:20:06,111 --> 00:20:10,911
...sister.  I mean, I, I really,
really like you as a friend.

324
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:14,535
Whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.
Are you dumping me?

325
00:20:14,535 --> 00:20:16,615
These ribs are for dumping?

326
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,081
No, they were more like kind of a bribe.

327
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:20,986
Oh.  For what?

328
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:25,101
Well, I was hoping
that maybe you could give
Mister Sheffield my picture and resume.

329
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:28,441
Picture and resume?
That's what you wanted to ask me?

330
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:31,938
Yeah, you know, for when
he casts his next show.

331
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:34,520
Well, why didn't you
just ask Maggie that?

332
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,166
Well, 'cause
I really like her

333
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,152
and I just didn't want her
to think that I was using her.

334
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:44,041
Oh, but you don't mind using me?
/ Yes.  No, no, no, no, I mean, I,

335
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:47,264
I just thought it would be easier
for you 'cause you're not shy.

336
00:20:47,264 --> 00:20:48,771
You're, you're...
/ Pushy.

337
00:20:48,771 --> 00:20:53,454
Exactly.
/ Give me the damn pictures.

338
00:20:53,454 --> 00:20:56,829
Oh, is Maggie here?  I thought
maybe we could go for a walk.

339
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:59,686
One minute, I'll get her.

340
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:06,039
There are nineteen rooms in this house.
You all ended up in here?

341
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:09,727
I needed a spoon.
/ I was returning the ladle.

342
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:12,824
All right, so you all heard.

343
00:21:12,824 --> 00:21:15,363
I feel your pain.

344
00:21:15,738 --> 00:21:17,095
Thank you.

345
00:21:17,095 --> 00:21:19,170
Come, children.

346
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:24,774
So does this mean that I have to
dump him since he dumped you?

347
00:21:24,774 --> 00:21:28,821
Technically, he didn't dump me
because he never liked me in the first place.

348
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:31,785
Okay?  So there's your loophole,
make your move.

349
00:21:31,785 --> 00:21:33,899
Thank you.
/ Go take a walk with your boyfriend,

350
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:37,616
and let this pushy old broad
eat her ribs in peace.

351
00:21:38,617 --> 00:21:40,847
May I?

352
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:44,001
Of course you can.
Have a good time.

353
00:21:44,001 --> 00:21:45,889
Thank you, Dad.

354
00:21:51,345 --> 00:21:53,644
Well, you're certainly singing
a different tune.

355
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:56,693
Hey, if I don't open the door,
she'll only sneak out the window.

356
00:21:56,693 --> 00:21:59,149
Oh, that's very wise.

357
00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:04,111
Yeah?  Yeah, some pushy
old broad told me.

358
00:22:04,111 --> 00:22:07,815
Miss Babcock, sir.
/ Well, I hope she brought Chester.

359
00:22:07,815 --> 00:22:10,313
Hello, all.

360
00:22:13,352 --> 00:22:15,436
Oh, Chester.  C'mere.

361
00:22:15,436 --> 00:22:18,151
Oh, good boy.

362
00:22:18,151 --> 00:22:21,650
Oh, thank God you're okay.

363
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:25,676
You better watch it.
She may need a muff.

364
00:22:36,741 --> 00:22:40,343
Oh, it's so great that
you love to floss.

365
00:22:40,343 --> 00:22:42,714
I mean, you only get
two sets of teeth.

366
00:22:42,714 --> 00:22:47,615
Except my cousin Ira, he got three.
But you know, he's a freak of nature.

367
00:22:47,615 --> 00:22:51,765
Here we go.
Oh, and look at you.

368
00:22:51,765 --> 00:22:55,589
Oh, how beautiful.
You'll never have gum disease.

369
00:22:55,589 --> 00:22:58,269
Yes.

370
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:01,455
You know they also
make a cinnamon floss.

371
00:23:01,455 --> 00:23:03,916
They make this great mint flavor.

372
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:08,940
You like that.  I wish the children
flossed like you.

373
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:14,856
I'm gonna tell Miss Babcock to buy
you a whole case of dental floss.
