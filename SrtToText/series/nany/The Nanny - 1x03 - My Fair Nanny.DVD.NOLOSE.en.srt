1
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:06,879
Okay, boys, here we go.

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,973
These are your gloves.
  This is the ball.

3
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:16,076
And these are the rules. You throw,
 you catch.  Reverse, repeat.

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,913
Where's your cap? 
/ Oh, I'm not really a cap person.

5
00:00:20,913 --> 00:00:25,072
Oh, come one.  You'll look adorable. 
/ My life's ambition.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,212
Try and be cool. 
  There.

7
00:00:29,212 --> 00:00:31,635
Oh, yeah.  We cool.

8
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:34,807
Come on, Gracie,
 we're going to the park.

9
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:37,749
I'm a little anxious
 about this whole kite thing.

10
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:39,952
Why, sweetie?  
We're gonna have fun.

11
00:00:39,952 --> 00:00:42,348
What if I let go of 
the string and lose it?

12
00:00:42,348 --> 00:00:44,961
I'm not good with separations.

13
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:49,858
You're not gonna lose it. 
 A kite is like a really cute guy.

14
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:52,692
You give him some slack,
 let him fly free.

15
00:00:52,692 --> 00:00:58,234
Then at the end of the day, you yank 
his string and reel him back in.

16
00:00:58,234 --> 00:01:02,482
And then hang him on a hook 
until you wanna use him again.

17
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:05,233
And I'm teaching you?

18
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:57,465
Okay, last question.  
What is the capitol of Peru?

19
00:01:57,465 --> 00:02:00,111
Lima. 
/ Very good.

20
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:03,830
Boy, if she could fit in your book bag,
 you might actually pass this test.

21
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,843
I don't need to be a genius. 
 I'm gonna be a producer, like Dad.

22
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:10,997
Who said that?

23
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:16,266
Good morning, everyone. 
 I have the most fabulous news.

24
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:19,804
They selected a dilettante
 for the biosphere?

25
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:22,881
I was at Elizabeth Arden getting 
a facial, manicure and herbal wrap...

26
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:28,934
You know, at Earl Schieb you could
 get the whole job done for eighty-nine
 ninety-five, bodywork included.

27
00:02:29,438 --> 00:02:31,962
Anyway, who do you think 
was under the next turban?

28
00:02:31,962 --> 00:02:34,686
Aladdin? 
/ Yasar Arafat?

29
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:36,634
No, that's not a turban.
  That's a banoose.

30
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:41,571
Well, whatever it is,
 he could use a facial.  
Or better yet, a chemical peel.

31
00:02:41,571 --> 00:02:44,602
Nanny Fine!
 / Well, we're giving him the Gaza Strip.

32
00:02:44,602 --> 00:02:49,359
Would it kill him to take a shave
 and put on a little Poco Riban?

33
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:53,136
Does the name Maureen Wentworth
 ring a bell? / Not even a jingle.

34
00:02:53,136 --> 00:02:55,738
She invested fifty thousand dollars
 in our last production.

35
00:02:55,738 --> 00:03:01,789
Ah, yes.  How is the dear lady? 
/ Fifty thousand dollars for a lousy play?

36
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:05,124
Oh, which I found delightful.

37
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:07,591
I'm still humming the tunes.

38
00:03:07,591 --> 00:03:10,838
Fifty thousand dollars is the 
kind of change she finds in her couch.

39
00:03:10,838 --> 00:03:14,030
These are the Wentworths.  
They came over on the Mayflower.

40
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,020
How did they know what to pack?  
I mean, you're going to a new world.

41
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,584
Is it hot?  Is it cold? 
 Is it raining?

42
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:24,607
There are no brochures.

43
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:27,589
They were Pilgrims, Miss Fine. 
 They all wore the same thing.

44
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:34,521
And that was a mistake.  Very few people 
can wear a big hat, a big collar, 
and a big buckle.

45
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:39,572
Anyway, Maureen and her daughter Cynthia 
are very active in the Cotillion Society,

46
00:03:39,572 --> 00:03:43,995
and I mentioned Maggie. 
 And they have invited her to be a Junior Deb.

47
00:03:43,995 --> 00:03:48,024
Oh, C.C., that's splendid.
  What a nice opportunity for Maggie.

48
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:50,775
Maggie?  Oh yes, of course.

49
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:53,531
And it wouldn't hurt us to 
cultivate some new old money.

50
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:58,676
Excuse me, but does anyone care
 how I feel about this? / I know I don't.

51
00:03:58,676 --> 00:04:01,924
Oh, you'll love it.  
I was a debutante...

52
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:05,771
It's the only way to meet the right people,
 make the right connections.

53
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:10,051
Marry the right man. 
/ But you never got married.

54
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:13,464
Good one.

55
00:04:15,943 --> 00:04:17,706
I don't want to be a deb.

56
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:20,141
But, sweetheart, it might help
 you come out of your shell.

57
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:22,144
I like my shell.

58
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:26,999
If you get real close to Maggie, 
you can hear the ocean.

59
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:29,879
You know, I agree with Miss Babcock.

60
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,871
I know, it was an ugly shock to me, too.

61
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:38,017
But, angel, I think it would
 be a good opportunity for you.

62
00:04:38,017 --> 00:04:41,069
I don't care what you all think.
  I don't wanna do it.

63
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:45,151
Kids.  I should have stayed 
in retail.  Oh...

64
00:04:48,082 --> 00:04:51,698
I mean, who does C.C. think 
she is butting into my social life?

65
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:54,025
What social life?

66
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:56,447
I just went to the movies with Denise.

67
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:01,040
Honey, she's the cleaning lady.

68
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,299
You're fourteen years old.  This house
 should be filled with obnoxious teenagers

69
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:09,926
swapping sweaters 
and trashing each other.

70
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:13,292
I hate all those girls.  
They all go to my school.

71
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:16,203
They're just so stuck up and snobby.

72
00:05:16,203 --> 00:05:18,459
Popular? 
/ Yeah.

73
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:21,830
Oh, honey, you could
 be just as popular.

74
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,927
You're smart and gorgeous, 
plus you got a double-A width.

75
00:05:24,927 --> 00:05:27,925
The world is your oyster.

76
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:30,862
Skinny feet cannot get
 you into this group.

77
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:33,078
You don't know what 
these cliques are like.

78
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:37,719
Oh, you think they're any different than 
the cosmetology club at Flushing High?

79
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:41,536
True, we had better nails.
  But all cliques are alike.

80
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:44,805
You got the leader of the pack. 
 She's the prettiest, the snobbiest,

81
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:47,756
and everybody wants to be her friend. 
/ Well, that's Cindy.

82
00:05:47,756 --> 00:05:50,653
Forget her.  She don't need you.

83
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:54,796
Find the low man on the totem pole and
 make your move.  You see, 
no one ever listens to her,

84
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:59,524
so she'll be grateful and wide open
 for infiltration. / How do I infiltrate?

85
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:04,886
Choose from the three universal topics. 
 Boys, clothes and Bobby Sherman.

86
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:07,030
Bobby who?

87
00:06:07,874 --> 00:06:12,019
Okay, Marky Mark.  But he doesn't
 have half the talent of Bobby.

88
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:16,940
It also helps to unite against
 a common enemy.  A good choice 
would be your gym teacher.

89
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,788
You make it sound like a war.

90
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:22,575
It's worse.  War is just hell.
  This is high school.

91
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:28,919
That's Bobby Sherman.

92
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,429
What's that?

93
00:06:30,429 --> 00:06:32,451
That's his hair.

94
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:36,243
Ain't he cute? 
/ He's not really my type.

95
00:06:36,243 --> 00:06:40,917
I'm torn between 
Barney and Ted Koppel.

96
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:45,194
Yeah, but Bobby could sing. 
 You should hear his records.

97
00:06:45,194 --> 00:06:47,943
What's a record?

98
00:06:47,943 --> 00:06:50,247
Oy, just bury me.

99
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:54,231
That sweater you wore 
today was just gorgeous.

100
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:57,770
Sure, no wonder Jason Matthews
 has a crush on you.

101
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,040
Don't you think he looks
 just like Marky Mark?

102
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,768
Three universal topics 
and sucking up.  Grand slam.

103
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:08,625
Can this be?  
Our Maggie has a friend?

104
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:12,002
You live long enough, 
you see everything.

105
00:07:15,912 --> 00:07:17,047
Where's Maxwell?

106
00:07:17,047 --> 00:07:18,949
Yes, I've been feeling
 a little under the weather,

107
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:21,473
but I'm much better now.

108
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:23,939
He wants these contracts 
in London by morning.

109
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:27,979
Well, here, hop on.  With the time
 difference you'll just make it.

110
00:07:31,136 --> 00:07:35,602
Fran, I'm on the phone
 with Cindy Wentworth,

111
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:38,755
and she'd like to know what 
to bring tomorrow.

112
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:42,666
I told her, potato salad. 
 And not the German kind.

113
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:47,212
Niles, why is Miss Fine using the words
 'Wentworth' and 'potato salad'
 in the same sentence.

114
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:51,461
Miss Margaret and Miss Fine are 
hosting a mother-daughter debutante tea.

115
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:53,935
You're hosting a society tea?

116
00:07:53,935 --> 00:07:57,823
Yeah.  I thought we'd do pot luck.
  That always goes over big.

117
00:07:57,823 --> 00:08:02,854
What? / Meanwhile, with all their 
money, go find someone to bring an entree.

118
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:06,231
You're asking Maureen Wentworth 
to bring her own food?

119
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:09,966
Well, fair is fair.  I mean, we're
 springing for the Make-Your-Own-Sundae Bar,

120
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:14,448
the cosmetic demonstration,
 and the gypsy fortune teller.

121
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:18,048
Come on, kids, let's go wrap 
the gifts for the grab bag.

122
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:21,654
Miss Fine, a moment. 
/ Does this mean you're not leaving?

123
00:08:22,538 --> 00:08:25,963
Sorry to disappoint you. 
/ I'll bounce back.

124
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,971
Okay, kids, start without me. 
 Oh, and, Maggie,

125
00:08:29,971 --> 00:08:33,065
make sure you take the best gift
 and wrap it in aluminum foil.

126
00:08:33,065 --> 00:08:36,021
That way you could always grab
 it for yourself.

127
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:37,838
Always the gracious hostess.

128
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:40,803
Oh, you should have seen 
my sweet sixteen at Benny's Clam Bar.

129
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:42,920
We took over the whole 
half-shell room.

130
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,455
I'm sure it was the highlight
 of the Flushing social season.

131
00:08:46,455 --> 00:08:49,641
No.  That was the Astoria
 Boulevard block party.

132
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:52,502
They had two of the Four Tops.

133
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,791
Miss Fine, my point is, a society
 hostess should have style, flair,

134
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:01,574
and a proper degree of social 
sophistication. / Yeah?  So?

135
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,652
So you're grossly underqualified.

136
00:09:05,652 --> 00:09:09,129
And you're still not 
his first choice.

137
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:11,935
Miss Fine, this is not 
a popularity contest.

138
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,787
And I won anyway.

139
00:09:15,787 --> 00:09:19,415
I'll have you know I have traveled 
in some pretty exclusive circles.

140
00:09:19,415 --> 00:09:21,896
I sat at the conference table
 on the Carnival Cruise.

141
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:25,064
Passed the A-One to Kathy Lee.

142
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,593
Miss Fine, this is not brunch
 with Captain Stubbing.

143
00:09:28,593 --> 00:09:31,604
These women are vicious, 
back stabbing, judgmental harpies.

144
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,578
I know.  They're my closest friends.

145
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:39,134
Oh, you don't scare me.  I have sat 
in on my mother's 
Mah jong group.

146
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:42,693
Uh, my fears are allayed.

147
00:09:42,693 --> 00:09:47,095
Maggie's social future rests 
securely in your capable hands.

148
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:54,429
Well, at least her fears 
are getting allayed.

149
00:09:57,849 --> 00:10:01,173
You know, I'm really getting
 the hang of this baseball thing.

150
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:02,821
I'm rather enjoying it, actually.

151
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:05,789
Don't toss the ball 
in the house, sir.

152
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:08,026
Niles, don't be such 
a stick in the mud.

153
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:11,694
Go on, old man, get out in the hall.
  I'll burn one in.

154
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,626
Dear God in heaven.

155
00:10:16,368 --> 00:10:17,699
All right, ready?

156
00:10:23,711 --> 00:10:25,833
It was old.

157
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:31,879
Ancient, actually. 
/ Oh well, one less thing to dust.

158
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:34,701
Well, maybe I'll just 
pay some bills.

159
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:38,960
Oh, and I was so hoping we could
 toss the frisbee around.

160
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:43,409
Who's Madam Malesxa?  And why am
 I paying her two hundred dollars?

161
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,287
She's the fortune teller Miss
 Fine hired for the party.

162
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:50,820
A fortune teller at a society tea? 
/ Perhaps she can read the leaves.

163
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,089
I don't know, Niles, I'm beginning
 to have second thoughts about this...

164
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:58,968
can you really picture Miss Fine in 
a room full of New York society matrons?

165
00:10:58,968 --> 00:11:01,636
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

166
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,371
You wanna hear a good one? 
 Miss Babcock was saying

167
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:10,624
I'm gonna stick out like a sore 
thumb at tomorrow's tea party.

168
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:17,189
Well, jump in any time 
with heartfelt reassurance.

169
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:19,506
Don't worry, Miss Fine.  
These ladies tend to be a bit stuffy,

170
00:11:19,506 --> 00:11:25,719
but you'll be a breath of fresh air.
 / A delightful novelty.

171
00:11:26,824 --> 00:11:31,914
In other words, a freak in the sideshow. 
/ Well, everybody loves the circus.

172
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:37,544
But I don't want to embarrass Maggie. 
 Fourteen is a very vulnerable age.

173
00:11:37,544 --> 00:11:40,852
I remember when I was fourteen.  
My mother came to pick me up after school

174
00:11:40,852 --> 00:11:43,326
in a halter top and peddle pushers.

175
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:47,274
Oh, I'm still looking for
 the right support group.

176
00:11:50,065 --> 00:11:54,330
All right, Miss Fine, let's, let's 
suppose for a moment we shared your concern.

177
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,787
It's really too late to cancel
 the party now...or is it?

178
00:11:58,787 --> 00:12:02,677
Oh no, don't.  You can't cancel.  
Maggie is counting on it.

179
00:12:02,677 --> 00:12:05,176
Can't you just teach me 
how to fit in?

180
00:12:05,176 --> 00:12:08,536
Come on, Niles, you know all about
 that fancy schmancy stuff.

181
00:12:08,536 --> 00:12:12,728
Yes, I'm very proud of my command of
 both the fancy and the schmancy.

182
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:18,827
So tell me, what is the difference
 between me and those ladies?

183
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:21,765
I wouldn't know where to begin.
 / Her clothes.

184
00:12:21,765 --> 00:12:23,631
Her hair. 
/ Her voice.

185
00:12:23,631 --> 00:12:28,914
Her laugh. / Boy, you came up
 with that list pretty fast.

186
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,146
It would be a monumental task.
 / Impossible.

187
00:12:32,146 --> 00:12:37,052
Oh, go for it.  I'm an empty
 canvas, a blank slate.

188
00:12:37,052 --> 00:12:40,680
I'm etch-o-sketch right 
after you shake it.

189
00:12:41,975 --> 00:12:44,838
All right, you're on.  
We have twenty-four hours

190
00:12:44,838 --> 00:12:48,400
to turn this breath of fresh
 air into a stale pretentious snob.

191
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,251
In other words, Miss Babcock.

192
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:54,948
By George, I think he's got it.

193
00:13:04,338 --> 00:13:06,713
Round tones, Miss Fine.

194
00:13:06,713 --> 00:13:10,140
How now brown cow.

195
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,567
How no brown...Oy...

196
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:20,873
Enough with the marbles.  I've 
swallowed three and passed two already.

197
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:24,992
How now brown cow.

198
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:27,392
Not that there's gonna
 be any cows at the party.

199
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:29,445
That's what you think.

200
00:13:30,424 --> 00:13:35,153
Party, Miss Fine. / Yes.  Let's 
try to capture that elusive letter 'R'.

201
00:13:35,153 --> 00:13:39,362
What? / Your accent, it's so...odd.

202
00:13:39,362 --> 00:13:43,108
It's inescapable. / I don't see an
 'R' coming out of your mouth.

203
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:47,866
That's because we're British. 
/ Yes, we can say anything 
we like and people think it's Shakespeare.

204
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,517
All right, repeat after me.

205
00:13:56,517 --> 00:14:00,236
Mark went on a lark after 
dark in Central Park.

206
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:02,883
Gee, I hope he has a gun.

207
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:08,052
Miss Fine, focus. / All right.  
But the Kennedy's don't have
 an 'R' between them.

208
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:11,533
They park the car in the river,
 and get away with it.

209
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:20,476
Oh no, it's all wrong. / I'll say.  
This book is flattening my whole pouf.

210
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:24,525
It's, it's your hips, Miss Fine. 
/ Well, I've never had any complaints before.

211
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:27,402
It's, it's the way they 
move from side to side.

212
00:14:27,402 --> 00:14:31,525
Well, I've never had
 any complaints before.

213
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:34,611
What's the matter?  
These ladies don't have hips?

214
00:14:34,611 --> 00:14:36,718
Not really.  No.

215
00:14:36,718 --> 00:14:39,064
And flat buns.

216
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:42,556
But who's looking?

217
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:47,944
Perhaps we should move 
on to conversations.

218
00:14:47,944 --> 00:14:51,087
Oh now that's my area of specialty.

219
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:53,368
I am never at a loss for words.

220
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:57,223
There are several topics which 
are appropriate in any social setting.

221
00:14:57,223 --> 00:14:59,715
The weather, current events,
 literature.

222
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:02,869
I'll take literature 
for a hundred, Alex.

223
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:06,312
What?  I shouldn't laugh?

224
00:15:06,312 --> 00:15:10,546
If you must, try a soft, breathy,
 ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

225
00:15:10,546 --> 00:15:13,295
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
 / And close.

226
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:19,866
No, no, no, no!

227
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:25,033
I can't believe you're knocking my style.
  I'm known for my style.

228
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:29,518
Except for that brief corn row 
period after I saw 'Ten'.

229
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:34,338
Now what about this beige frock?

230
00:15:34,338 --> 00:15:37,424
That's my dress bag.

231
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:44,078
Two armholes and a string of pearls.

232
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:46,173
Could work.

233
00:15:48,271 --> 00:15:52,808
This is the fish knife, the steak knife,
 the salad knife, and the butter knife.

234
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:56,223
You know, one amazing Ginsu 
could do it all.

235
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:58,859
All right, let's start again.

236
00:15:58,859 --> 00:16:02,001
The salad course has
 arrived and you pick up your...

237
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:03,937
The salad fork.

238
00:16:03,937 --> 00:16:06,985
And wrong again. 
/ That is your shrimp fork.

239
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:10,750
Well, I don't know about you, 
but I'm getting shrimp salad.

240
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,663
All right, we've, we've finished 
our meal.  What do we do now?

241
00:16:13,663 --> 00:16:17,989
Well, if you're at my mother's house, 
you open your pants and flop on the couch.

242
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:21,010
Guess again.

243
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,709
Oh, yeah...

244
00:16:26,494 --> 00:16:28,830
Tart, but refreshing.

245
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,151
No, Miss Fine, that is
 your finger bowl!

246
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:35,892
It's for washing the fingers. 
/ What?  These people can't afford Wet Naps?

247
00:16:44,989 --> 00:16:47,478
Oh God, this is worse
 than any opening night.

248
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:49,771
And the critics here 
are much tougher.

249
00:16:49,771 --> 00:16:52,274
Well, whatever happens, Niles, 
I've enjoyed working with you.

250
00:16:52,274 --> 00:16:54,865
Same here, sir.  Somehow 
I feel closer to you.

251
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:57,868
Well, let's not get carried away,
 old man. / Sorry, sir.

252
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:02,693
I say, old man, we did it. 
/ We did it. / We did it.

253
00:17:02,693 --> 00:17:05,960
We said that we would do it.
 / And indeed we did it.

254
00:17:06,649 --> 00:17:10,311
Hello.  How do you do?

255
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:14,644
How now brown cow?

256
00:17:19,741 --> 00:17:23,158
Maureen. / C.C. How lovely to see you.

257
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:25,018
Kiss, kiss. / Hug, hug.

258
00:17:25,018 --> 00:17:29,544
Uh, tell me, who is that lovely
 creature on Maxwell's arm?

259
00:17:29,544 --> 00:17:30,894
That's the nanny.

260
00:17:30,894 --> 00:17:35,490
Oh.  And yet, what a stunning outfit.
 / Thank you.

261
00:17:37,586 --> 00:17:41,456
Mrs. Wentworth, I'd like you to
 meet our hostess, Miss Fran Fine.

262
00:17:41,456 --> 00:17:45,485
Charmed I'm sure.
 / Look who discovered the letter 'R'.

263
00:17:45,485 --> 00:17:47,945
Please excuse me for being tardy,

264
00:17:47,945 --> 00:17:54,121
but I was on the phone with my mother, 
and she can be such a yenta.

265
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,752
This is a great party, Maggie.  
It's almost as much fun as algebra.

266
00:17:58,752 --> 00:18:01,285
Look, guys,
 it's gonna get better, really.

267
00:18:01,285 --> 00:18:04,145
Fran has the whole party all planned.

268
00:18:04,145 --> 00:18:06,990
What a lovely artifact. 
 Is it Mayan?

269
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,990
No.  It's his-an.

270
00:18:11,028 --> 00:18:14,554
Niles, Mayday.
 / I'm on it, sir.

271
00:18:14,554 --> 00:18:16,442
Would you care for 
a cucumber sandwich?

272
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:18,448
Oh, thank you. 
 Don't these look yummy?

273
00:18:18,448 --> 00:18:23,273
Please, enjoy.  I've had the seeds 
removed to avoid gas.

274
00:18:23,273 --> 00:18:26,918
Let's meet our guests. Gas, Miss Fine?

275
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:29,195
I was just trying to make
 conversation. / Indeed.

276
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:32,206
Literature, the weather,
 and the lively arts. 
 They're such narrow topics.

277
00:18:32,206 --> 00:18:36,048
One must invariably turn 
to flatulence for inspiration.

278
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:39,398
Would you like to come up to
 my room and play with my Game Boy?

279
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:41,551
Eat dirt. 
/ Okay.

280
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,728
Dead my uncle was, 
right there on the couch.

281
00:18:45,728 --> 00:18:51,771
Only nobody noticed until the seventh 
inning stretch, when he did not.

282
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,498
And close.

283
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:01,313
Fran, could I talk to you
 for a moment?

284
00:19:01,313 --> 00:19:05,074
If you'll excuse me, we'll schmooze later.

285
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:10,570
Fran, my friends are bored. 
 I thought you said we were 
gonna have entertainment.

286
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,642
Well, we're gonna sing Magicals 
with the harpist. Is this classy or what?

287
00:19:14,642 --> 00:19:16,656
No, it stinks. 
/ What?

288
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:20,039
This is the worst party
 I've ever been to.

289
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,275
She obviously missed 
my cousin Ira's Briss.

290
00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:33,141
I take it in there you weren't
 entirely thrilled with the party.

291
00:19:33,141 --> 00:19:35,381
What happened to the party we planned?

292
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:37,754
Well I thought that
 this would be better.

293
00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:40,903
You know, classier,
 more like what you're used to.

294
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:43,310
I'm used to sitting home alone.

295
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:47,254
All right, so after this party things
 should be back to normal.

296
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:49,272
What have you done to yourself?

297
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,552
That hair, and that outfit.

298
00:19:51,552 --> 00:19:54,285
And where did you get that voice?

299
00:19:54,285 --> 00:19:57,054
Well, I got a little from Niles, 
a little from your father.

300
00:19:57,054 --> 00:20:00,428
But mostly Mrs. Harold.

301
00:20:00,428 --> 00:20:02,912
What were you thinking? 
/ Oh, I wasn't.

302
00:20:02,912 --> 00:20:05,977
I listened to Miss Babcock. 
 Why I don't know.

303
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:12,029
Does she entertain?  
In all the time I've known the woman,
 she's never had me over once.

304
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:17,152
I can't believe you dressed up
 like a geek and ruined my party. / Oy.

305
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:21,202
It's the nicest thing anyone
 has ever done for me.

306
00:20:21,202 --> 00:20:25,445
Oh, don't mention it...
 Ever again.

307
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:27,742
You know, you didn't
 have to change.

308
00:20:27,742 --> 00:20:30,381
Aren't you always
 telling me to be myself?

309
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:33,643
Sure, when you're you:  Perfection.  
You could be yourself.

310
00:20:33,643 --> 00:20:36,298
But when you're me,
 diamonds in the rough.

311
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:39,201
Are you kidding? 
 I'd kill to be like you.

312
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:42,938
Really?  I'd kill to be like you.

313
00:20:43,847 --> 00:20:47,149
So what d' you say we go throw
 a party that'll kill C.C.?

314
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:50,097
Oh now, you're thinking like a deb.

315
00:20:50,097 --> 00:20:52,691
Kiss, kiss. 
/ Hug, hug.

316
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,990
Come on, take my hair out.
 / All right.

317
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:04,893
Actually, my people came over
 on the Mayflower.

318
00:21:04,893 --> 00:21:08,209
Oh, of course, the collar,
 the buckle.

319
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:11,691
I didn't put it together without the hat.

320
00:21:14,078 --> 00:21:18,852
We landed on Plymouth Rock.  
My family can be traced back
 for five hundred years.

321
00:21:18,852 --> 00:21:21,382
We landed on Ellis Island.
 They changed our names

322
00:21:21,382 --> 00:21:24,219
and now we don't know
 who the hell we were.

323
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,980
Okay, who wants sprinkles?

324
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,805
Your father is really cute.

325
00:21:33,805 --> 00:21:38,120
You know, they say I look 
just like him. / They lied.

326
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:42,543
You know, these are just delicious.
 / You like, huh?

327
00:21:42,543 --> 00:21:45,873
Marshmallow Rice Krispie treats. 
 Always a big hit.

328
00:21:45,873 --> 00:21:49,385
You must give me the recipe for Cook.
/ Honey, buy the cereal.

329
00:21:49,385 --> 00:21:53,655
It's right on the side panel. 
 What?  You're gonna make me write it down?

330
00:21:54,361 --> 00:22:00,150
Maxwell, this woman is a gem. 
/ Oh, Maureen, enough.

331
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,140
Fran tells me you're mounting
 a new musical.  I want in.

332
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,254
Do you think that you have
 room for one more investor?

333
00:22:07,254 --> 00:22:09,238
Well, for Mrs.
 Wentworth, anything.

334
00:22:09,238 --> 00:22:11,858
And I'm certain this one's 
gonna be a monster hit.

335
00:22:11,858 --> 00:22:15,667
I know.  The fortune teller told me.

336
00:22:15,974 --> 00:22:22,182
I tell you for the hundredth time, 
I see no tall, dark handsome
 nothing in your future.

337
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:30,385
This is a great party, Maggie. 
 I hate to go home.

338
00:22:30,385 --> 00:22:32,886
What do you say I give you 
a ride in the limo?

339
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:35,566
Just me and you in the backseat?

340
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:37,968
Okay.

341
00:22:39,237 --> 00:22:40,982
Oh God!

342
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,839
Fran, thanks for everything.
 / Oh, angel.

343
00:22:49,691 --> 00:22:52,065
I never doubted you for a minute.

344
00:22:52,065 --> 00:22:54,058
Come on, I want you to pick
 first from the grab bag.

345
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:55,639
Me?

346
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:58,936
Oh, I wasn't gonna pick.
 All right.

347
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:05,013
Oh, I wonder what this could be?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
