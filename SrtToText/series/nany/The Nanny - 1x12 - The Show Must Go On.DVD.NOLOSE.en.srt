1
00:00:04,757 --> 00:00:06,974
Niles, this steak
is a little tough.

2
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,945
So is life...

3
00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:11,550
and then you die.

4
00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:15,932
Okay, what do you think?

5
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,047
This one itches
but I look taller.

6
00:00:18,047 --> 00:00:21,398
This one pinches,
but I look thinner.

7
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:24,486
Have you ever considered choosing
a wardrobe based on comfort?

8
00:00:24,486 --> 00:00:27,931
No!  Once you start
dressing for comfort,

9
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:33,403
the next thing you know you're on line
at Pathmark wearing orthopedic
shoes buying Nair.

10
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:35,887
It is just a P.T.A. meeting.

11
00:00:35,887 --> 00:00:41,402
Yeah, well, meanwhile, some of those P's
and T's could be lonely he's.

12
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:44,413
You've certainly got
the 'A' for it.

13
00:00:45,131 --> 00:00:48,198
Meanwhile, I don't want
to embarrass Gracie.

14
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:51,465
You could never embarrass me.
/ Oh...

15
00:00:51,465 --> 00:00:56,735
Except that time at the playground you screamed
at Bobby Mitchell for hogging a swing.

16
00:00:56,735 --> 00:00:59,767
Well, it was my turn.

17
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:02,379
What d' you think, Mags?
/ Go with the black.

18
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:05,495
Smaller price tags are easier to hide,
and you can still return it.

19
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:07,690
Very good!

20
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,684
Oh, at this age
they're like a sponge.

21
00:01:11,684 --> 00:01:14,453
And she's got almost
as much personality.

22
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:20,526
Oh, look, that P.T.A. is
planning their big pageant.

23
00:01:20,526 --> 00:01:24,020
Isn't that right up your alley?
/ I produce plays for a living.

24
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,509
Why on earth would I want to do
that in my spare time?

25
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:29,768
Well, because Grace is gonna
be in it. / She is?

26
00:01:29,768 --> 00:01:32,549
I am? / You are.

27
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,093
Come on, it'll be fun.

28
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:38,126
You'll get to play with all the
other children, wear make-up, costumes.

29
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:40,484
Besides, it's
a great way to get guys.

30
00:01:40,484 --> 00:01:43,529
What do I do with
them when I get them?

31
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:46,267
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

32
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:48,933
Grace performing in public?
/ Yeah.  What's the matter?

33
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:53,447
Well, for one thing, she's in therapy twice
a week for being insecure and introverted.

34
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:57,325
So's Barbara Streisand, but meanwhile
she's getting a thousand bucks a ticket,

35
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:01,682
and that's without a beverage.
Liza, we got prime rib.

36
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:03,887
Oh, I'm just thrilled
about this school.

37
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:07,677
Wasn't it sweet the way they hung
all the arts and crafts out in the hall?

38
00:03:07,677 --> 00:03:10,803
I'll tell you, that Pablo is
a very talented kid.

39
00:03:10,803 --> 00:03:13,742
Miss Fine, that was a Picasso.

40
00:03:14,971 --> 00:03:18,969
An adult did those?
Ech...

41
00:03:20,018 --> 00:03:25,246
Oh, don't look now,
but we are making quite a stir.

42
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,958
Guess I wore the right outfit.

43
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,939
Miss Fine, they're looking at me.

44
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:32,610
They think just because
I'm a Broadway producer
and I'm at this meeting,

45
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,448
they're gonna rope me
into staging the pageant.

46
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:38,422
Oh... / Uh-oh, here it comes.
/ Oh, boy.

47
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:40,860
I love your outfit.

48
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:44,192
Everybody's talking about it.

49
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:46,078
Oh, thank you.

50
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:50,788
Mister Sheffield,
what a surprise!

51
00:03:50,788 --> 00:03:53,134
I know how busy you are.

52
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:57,928
Night and day, like a dog.
But never too busy for his kids.

53
00:03:57,928 --> 00:04:01,175
And you are?
/ This is our nanny, Miss Fran Fine.

54
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:04,867
This is Miss Emma Trusdale,
Lexington's head mistress.

55
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:09,081
Oh, head mistress, huh?
Honey, you're living in a dream world.

56
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:12,841
No matter what they say,
they never leave their wives.

57
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,118
We're about to begin,
Mister Sheffield.

58
00:04:18,118 --> 00:04:22,979
Why don't you just have a seat
here on the front row next to me.

59
00:04:23,301 --> 00:04:25,746
Oh, teacher's pet, huh?

60
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:28,161
Attention, everyone.

61
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:30,605
In a wonderful coincidence,

62
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:34,586
we are here to discuss
this year's school pageant,

63
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:39,477
and we have amongst us the esteemed
Broadway producer, Maxwell Sheffield.

64
00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:41,519
I'm your greatest fan.

65
00:04:44,272 --> 00:04:47,482
That shade of lipstick
looks great on your butt.

66
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,703
Miss Fine, would you care
to share that with everyone?

67
00:04:52,703 --> 00:04:55,613
No, Miss Trusdale.

68
00:04:57,989 --> 00:05:00,776
And now to the business at hand.

69
00:05:00,776 --> 00:05:05,680
We need a volunteer to serve
as director for this year's pageant,

70
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,458
Mother Goose's Broadway.
/ Here it comes.

71
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,765
Well, it wouldn't hurt you
to get involved.

72
00:05:11,765 --> 00:05:15,103
Perhaps Mister Sheffield can...
/ ...suggest someone?

73
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:17,488
Oh yes, I'd be delighted to.

74
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:21,033
I'd like to suggest
Miss Fran Fine.

75
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:23,485
Oh, me?
/ Her?

76
00:05:23,485 --> 00:05:25,750
Oh, I don't know
anything about theater.

77
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,382
Well, remarkably, that never
stopped you from doing anything.

78
00:05:28,382 --> 00:05:31,963
Well, I did play 'Huddle' in the
third grade production of Fiddler.

79
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:35,808
No, no, if Mister Sheffield is busy,
I'm sure one of the other parents is

80
00:05:35,808 --> 00:05:39,501
eager to volunteer for
this exciting challenge.

81
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:44,602
The Flushing Observer said,
"Fran Fine was a standout as Tevia's lost,

82
00:05:44,602 --> 00:05:47,490
but heavily made-up daughter."

83
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:52,409
Anyone at all,
just raise your hand.

84
00:05:54,241 --> 00:05:57,518
The time to raise
your hand would be now.

85
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:04,018
How about you, Miss Fine.
/ Oh, Miss Trusdale, I accept.

86
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:07,250
And I just wanna thank you
all for your confidence in me.

87
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,902
I only hope I can
live up to your expec...

88
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,392
Moving on!
/ ...tations.

89
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:23,498
Hey, hey, hey, no running.
You could poke somebody's eye out.

90
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:27,331
Oh, I just gave my first piece
of direction. / Hmm, and I was there.

91
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:31,008
Mommy, I'm hungry.
/ You ate yesterday!

92
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:34,312
Fat girls don't
get leads.

93
00:06:35,115 --> 00:06:41,055
Good God, I just had a horrible
flashback to those Annie Two auditions.

94
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:43,497
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh...

95
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:46,588
Back!  Back!

96
00:06:47,213 --> 00:06:48,887
Keep moving, Maxwell;

97
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:52,178
they're small but they're
dangerous when they swarm.

98
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:56,055
Okay, everybody, I want
my dancing daisies over here,

99
00:06:56,055 --> 00:06:59,153
my singing mushrooms over there.

100
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:00,931
Daisies, mushrooms.

101
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:05,406
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you, you, you.
You're not a flower, you're a fungus.

102
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:09,638
Miss Fine, where's
the sign-up sheet? / The what?

103
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,748
Well, you really ought
to have a sign-up sheet.

104
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:14,962
Oh, it isn't necessary.
This is just a kid's play.

105
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:18,548
What do we do with our music?
/ Oh, give it to the accompanist.

106
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:20,656
You do have an accompanist?

107
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:22,887
Oh, yes, yes, of course we do.

108
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:26,036
Uh, Maggie, get off the phone
and go sit at the piano.

109
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:30,534
Hey, big guy.
/ Excuse me?

110
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:34,500
I hear you're close to the director.
/ Fran?  Oh, she works for us.

111
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,989
Gee, I'd do anything to play
the lead.  And I do mean anything.

112
00:07:41,863 --> 00:07:44,269
Does your mother know you're
saying this? / Oh, yeah.

113
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:47,101
She wrote it down for me.  See?

114
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:50,426
And now I'm supposed
to kiss you.

115
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:54,561
Sing, Bernard.

116
00:07:55,004 --> 00:07:57,741
Sing, Bernard!

117
00:07:57,741 --> 00:07:59,758
Sing!

118
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,003
That's okay, Benard.

119
00:08:03,003 --> 00:08:07,033
That's okay.
We'll make you a mushroom.

120
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:09,550
"Shitocky."

121
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,176
Okay, next we're going to audition
for the first grade number.

122
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:16,819
Now this scene opens up
the whole pageant.

123
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:19,456
Gracie, you're on.

124
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:25,788
The itsy bitsy spider went up
the water spout. / Sing it, Gracie.

125
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:30,572
Down came the rain and washed
the spider out. / One more time.

126
00:08:30,572 --> 00:08:35,156
Out came the sun and dried up
all the rain... / Bring it home!

127
00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:39,069
...and the itsy bitsy spider
went up the spout again.

128
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:41,885
Oh, wonderful!
Wonderful!

129
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:44,664
You're darling.
Wasn't she wonderful?

130
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:47,912
We're next. / Oh.

131
00:08:47,912 --> 00:08:49,725
Come on, dear.

132
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:53,039
Now stand right here,
sweetheart.  Smile.

133
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,394
All right.  And one,
and two, and three... Tempo!

134
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,604
Johnny could only sing one note
and the note he sang was this.

135
00:09:02,604 --> 00:09:05,426
Oh...

136
00:09:05,426 --> 00:09:07,014
Thank you.

137
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,006
Thank you.

138
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:11,750
Thank you!

139
00:09:17,138 --> 00:09:20,324
Thank you, that was very nice.
Sit down, honey.

140
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:24,398
Well, I don't even think there's
a question, do you? / No.

141
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,612
It's Gracie by a mile.

142
00:09:26,612 --> 00:09:30,827
Miss Fine, how could you possibly
make that choice? This other girl
was phenomenal.

143
00:09:30,827 --> 00:09:34,457
Well, what do I care about
that little girl?  Am I her nanny?

144
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:39,230
No, you're the director, and you're
supposed to cast actors according
to talent, not on who they know.

145
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,151
What show business are
you working in?

146
00:09:45,302 --> 00:09:49,902
Besides, look at Gracie.
She's already so confident and outgoing.

147
00:09:49,902 --> 00:09:52,464
Have you ever seen her so happy?

148
00:09:52,464 --> 00:09:54,401
Daddy, I got the part!

149
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,093
They like me.
They really like me.

150
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:01,722
I suppose it was the right choice.

151
00:10:01,722 --> 00:10:03,899
I'll work with her.
/ Sure.

152
00:10:06,502 --> 00:10:08,826
And touch, and touch, and touch,
and touch, and step...

153
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:14,108
and turn, turn, turn,
cross and squat.

154
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:16,787
Honey, very good.

155
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:20,957
Now help Miss Fine up.
Come on.  Thank you.

156
00:10:20,957 --> 00:10:24,485
Meanwhile, these pantyhose
have a life of their own.

157
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,184
Mister Sheffield, you've decided
to help afterall.  What a relief.

158
00:10:30,184 --> 00:10:32,095
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm not here to direct the show.

159
00:10:32,095 --> 00:10:35,093
I'm just here to support
my little girl. / Oh.

160
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,195
Oh, hi, Mister Sheffield.
/ Hi, Daddy.

161
00:10:37,195 --> 00:10:42,505
Hello.  How's it going? / Oh, fabulous.
The kids are having a great time.

162
00:10:42,505 --> 00:10:46,844
Billy, stop biting my leg.
What'd you think of the number?

163
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:52,140
Well, why are, why are they all
wearing paper bags on their heads?

164
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,959
They're mushroom caps.
/ Oh.

165
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,389
Who did the wardrobe, A and P?
/ Maybe.

166
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:04,554
I had a choice of paper or plastic.
But you know, they tend to discourage
plastic bags on kids heads.

167
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:09,160
Well, I suppose it will all come
together once the set's up.

168
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,449
The set is up.
/ Hmm...

169
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:15,308
You know, not to discourage
your input here, but uh,

170
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:18,245
well, I kind of have
a vision going.

171
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:21,679
Perhaps Mister Sheffield could
just fine tune the costumes.

172
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,317
And the scenery.
/ And the lights...

173
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:28,468
maybe tell the actors where to stand.
/ And how to deliver their lines.

174
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:31,585
I'm not an expert
on theatrical terminology,

175
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:34,682
but wouldn't that be
considered directing?

176
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:37,186
All right, if you insist...

177
00:11:37,186 --> 00:11:39,720
Gracie, honey,
Daddy's going to direct.

178
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,866
Yoo-hoo...aren't you
forgetting just one thing?

179
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:45,688
Oh, all right, I'll do
the choreography too.

180
00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:48,433
Well, what about Fran?
/ Yeah, what about Fran?

181
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:51,234
You could be the Producer.
/ That's right!  Congratulations!

182
00:11:51,234 --> 00:11:53,129
Congratulations...

183
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:59,861
Now, Miss Trusdale, I see a follow
spot and a lone French Horn...just wailing...

184
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:02,981
Shouldn't the producer
be in on this?...

185
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:04,962
We'll do lunch...

186
00:12:11,203 --> 00:12:15,467
Mary had a little lamb.

187
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:21,462
It's fleece was
white as snow....snow!

188
00:12:21,462 --> 00:12:23,371
Thank you.

189
00:12:23,371 --> 00:12:24,595
Thank...

190
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:28,790
Andrea, love,
you're not blending in.

191
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,826
You're upstaging
everyone.

192
00:12:30,826 --> 00:12:33,307
My mother says
my voice is a gift.

193
00:12:33,307 --> 00:12:35,825
Well, return it.

194
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:40,712
Wait, second, second flower, where,
where are you going?  Get back in line.

195
00:12:40,712 --> 00:12:44,034
She has to make.
/ She has to make what?

196
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:46,586
A doody.

197
00:12:46,586 --> 00:12:48,425
Very well, carry on.

198
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:50,980
Grace, sweetheart,

199
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,359
you're not relating
to your lamb.

200
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:55,418
You see, you have
to listen to the lyrics.

201
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:58,031
The lamb follows you
everywhere you go.

202
00:12:58,031 --> 00:13:00,194
You're very attached to it.

203
00:13:00,194 --> 00:13:03,624
I don't get it.
/ The lamb's codependent.

204
00:13:03,624 --> 00:13:05,239
Oh...

205
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,367
All right, once more from the top.

206
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:11,426
This time, just Grace.

207
00:13:11,426 --> 00:13:17,019
Mary had a little...
/ We're forgetting everything.

208
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:20,068
All right, we'll work on
it later.  Go on, take five.

209
00:13:20,068 --> 00:13:22,785
Not you, Grace.  You better
work on your time step.

210
00:13:22,785 --> 00:13:24,916
Oh, these amateurs.

211
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,787
Where are all the great child
actors when you need them?

212
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:30,473
Robbing Seven-Elevens.

213
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:36,130
Careful, Gracie, wouldn't
want to fall off the stage.

214
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,910
Andrea, got a cookie.

215
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,810
Fetch.

216
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:45,594
It was more fun when
you were directing.

217
00:13:45,594 --> 00:13:48,624
I know.  Can I get you anything?

218
00:13:48,624 --> 00:13:52,361
Juice.  And to keep my therapist.

219
00:13:59,986 --> 00:14:03,533
Oh, she's been tapping for hours.
I'll tell you, it's a crime.

220
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:06,128
I'll say.  I just waxed the floor.

221
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:09,437
She's like the energizer rabbit.
She just keeps going and going.

222
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:11,526
The vacuum cleaner is destroyed.

223
00:14:11,526 --> 00:14:14,326
Hoover doesn't make
a Gummy Bear attachment.

224
00:14:14,326 --> 00:14:17,919
Nothing that she does is good enough.
What is the matter with that man?

225
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:22,424
Doesn't he believe in nepotism?
I mean, where would Lorna Luft be today?

226
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:26,752
Did you ever try to get
bazooka out of brocade?

227
00:14:26,752 --> 00:14:28,841
Wait a minute, what's that?

228
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:30,527
I believe it's Morse Code.

229
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:33,911
S.O.S.

230
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:36,328
She needs my help.  I gotta
talk to Mister Sheffield.

231
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:40,319
I don't know what you're doing.
An ice cube will lift that gum right up.

232
00:14:41,832 --> 00:14:44,154
Of course, I've always wanted
to direct as well.

233
00:14:44,154 --> 00:14:48,575
And I find the children's theater
genre absolutely fascinating.

234
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,266
How do you spell "genre"?

235
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,380
Mister Sheffield, can I have
a word with you please?

236
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,136
Well, I'm in the middle of
an interview, Miss Fine.

237
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:58,683
Oh.  Take your time.

238
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:03,124
Could you give us a minute, please?
/ Okay.  But don't keep me waiting.

239
00:15:03,124 --> 00:15:06,252
I'm also the reviewer.

240
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:10,311
Make sure on show night we have plenty
of cookies backstage for the press.

241
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:14,495
Mister Sheffield, aren't you taking
this a little too seriously?

242
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:16,707
Absolutely not.
/ Excuse me, sir.

243
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:21,991
Andrew Lloyd Webber phoned.
You have the Phantom orchestra. / Yes!

244
00:15:21,991 --> 00:15:24,841
Well, you're the one who wanted
me to get involved. / Yes, I know.

245
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:28,506
But you're working these kids
entirely too hard.  Especially Gracie.

246
00:15:28,506 --> 00:15:31,753
Oh, my father pushed me and
look where I am today.

247
00:15:31,753 --> 00:15:35,084
Three thousand miles and
an ocean away.

248
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:39,022
I'm telling you, you're turning her
into a regular Lenny Shinebaum.

249
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:42,164
Miss Fine, please, spare me.
/ Well...

250
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:46,751
Okay.  Who's Lenny Shinebaum?

251
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:50,486
His father made him so nervous about
taking over the family business,

252
00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:55,024
that he started pulling his hair out of
his head and was bald by the time he was fifteen.

253
00:15:55,024 --> 00:15:59,998
Although, he did become C.E.O.
for the largest linoleum chain
in the tri-state area.

254
00:15:59,998 --> 00:16:02,524
Did I mention he was
interested in me?

255
00:16:02,524 --> 00:16:05,894
I knew I shouldn't have asked.
/ I'm giving you pearls here.

256
00:16:05,894 --> 00:16:09,865
I'm telling you, if you don't
stop pushing her, Gracie's gonna
grow up to resent her father.

257
00:16:09,865 --> 00:16:12,390
Nonsense. / Oh, that's
what Lenny's father thought

258
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:18,078
until Lenny shipped him off
to the Lincoln Tunnel
Retirement Home, Jersey view.

259
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,571
Well, unlike
the ingrate Shinebaum,

260
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:23,495
Grace appreciates that I just
want her to be the best.

261
00:16:23,495 --> 00:16:26,422
You know, this was supposed
to be a fun experience,

262
00:16:26,422 --> 00:16:32,238
but instead she's upstairs tapping her
brains out like some kind of a deranged Ann Miller.

263
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:35,317
That's redundant.

264
00:16:35,992 --> 00:16:38,553
Miss Fine, you're over-reacting.

265
00:16:38,553 --> 00:16:43,534
And I suppose this doesn't have
anything to do with my replacing
you as director.

266
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:49,050
Oh, well, if that isn't the most insulting,
pretty thing I ever heard.

267
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,724
Besides, I wasn't replaced,
I was promoted to producer.

268
00:16:53,724 --> 00:16:55,571
Sucker.

269
00:16:56,651 --> 00:17:00,613
Mister Sheffield, can the producer
fire the director?

270
00:17:00,613 --> 00:17:02,407
Yes.
/ Oh?

271
00:17:03,277 --> 00:17:07,567
As easily as the father can
fire the nanny. / Oh.

272
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:18,284
Are you the usher?

273
00:17:18,284 --> 00:17:21,114
No.  I'm the producer.

274
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:23,592
Let me see your tickets.

275
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,066
Lady, will you wipe my nose?

276
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:38,616
No.

277
00:17:42,137 --> 00:17:44,229
Don't you have any parents?

278
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,830
Yeah, but they're busy.

279
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,220
J.B. Binghamton, the investment
banker, is your father?

280
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,668
Yes.

281
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,753
Blow.

282
00:17:57,835 --> 00:18:01,828
I can't believe Dad made us come.
/ This is gonna be so lame.

283
00:18:01,828 --> 00:18:05,761
Now, children, this is your sister's
big night.  I think we should all support her.

284
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:08,737
I brought cards. / I'll deal.

285
00:18:09,406 --> 00:18:15,187
Miss Fine, uh, we, uh,
we have a bit of a crisis.

286
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:19,582
Grace is refusing to go on.
I, uh, I think it's stage fright.

287
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:25,580
Oh, well, I wonder why.  You've made
the stage such a warm and loving place.

288
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,418
Well, I need your help.
You, you need to speak with her.

289
00:18:28,418 --> 00:18:33,602
Me talk to the actors?  Why isn't
that the director's job?

290
00:18:37,252 --> 00:18:38,941
What?  What?  What?

291
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:40,944
You want me to admit I was wrong.

292
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:45,095
Oh, you think I'm that small?
Turns out I am.

293
00:18:45,095 --> 00:18:48,772
Fine.  I was wrong.
I'll hand myself later.

294
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:52,551
Look, all I wanted was for Grace to go
out on that stage and have everyone love her.

295
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:54,694
Honey, she doesn't care
if everyone loves her.

296
00:18:54,694 --> 00:18:57,664
All she cares is
if you love her.

297
00:18:57,664 --> 00:19:01,123
I'm turning into Lenny Shinebaum's father.

298
00:19:01,123 --> 00:19:05,390
Worse.  My own.
I swore I'd never be like him.

299
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,711
Oh, that's all right,
Mister Sheffield.

300
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:14,121
I, myself, have to fight the urge to wash
out gefullter fish jars and use them as glasses.

301
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,134
She's in here.

302
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:22,457
Um, Gracie, honey, oh...
/ I can't work with that man.

303
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:27,660
Grace, sweetheart, I'm, I'm sorry
I was such an ogre.

304
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,638
I didn't mean to push you so hard.

305
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:35,463
Look, you're more important
to me than any silly play.

306
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:38,952
I'm so proud of you whether
you go on or not.

307
00:19:38,952 --> 00:19:41,176
Thank you, Daddy.

308
00:19:41,176 --> 00:19:44,306
'Cause I really don't
want to go on.

309
00:19:44,306 --> 00:19:46,322
Are you insane?

310
00:19:46,322 --> 00:19:50,873
The house is full.  We've got
a critic out there, and the whole
show rests on your shoulders.

311
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:57,969
Paging Mister Shinebaum.
/ Sorry.  Wrong again.

312
00:19:57,969 --> 00:20:01,136
Oh, sweetheart, it's just that
you've worked so hard at this show

313
00:20:01,136 --> 00:20:03,924
and I really think
you could be brilliant.

314
00:20:03,924 --> 00:20:08,151
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I just can't.

315
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:10,176
Miss Fine?
/ Yeah?

316
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,411
The one time I'd like you to butt in.

317
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:18,055
Hey, I'm with her.  Who needs it?
All those people looking at you,
all the lights in your eye.

318
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:20,278
Oh, the whole thing's a turn off.

319
00:20:20,278 --> 00:20:23,262
Thank you, Miss Fine.
/ You know what, honey?  Don't worry.

320
00:20:23,262 --> 00:20:29,040
The show will go on.  Andrea knows
all of your lines.  She will take your place.

321
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,555
Over my dead body.
Hold the curtain.  Make-up!

322
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:39,503
That's why they call
me the producer.

323
00:20:43,735 --> 00:20:48,581
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
the Lexington Academy's annual pageant.

324
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,555
A Maxwell Sheffield
Production...

325
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:42,648
"The itsy bitsy spider went up
the water spout.

326
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:47,722
Down came the rain and washed
the spider out."

327
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:50,549
My God, she has got something,
hasn't she?

328
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:53,039
Yeah.  Guts.

329
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,634
Oh, Mister Sheffield,
the reviews are in.

330
00:22:10,634 --> 00:22:12,387
Oh, let me see, let me see.
What do, what do they say?

331
00:22:12,387 --> 00:22:16,933
Well, they loved Gracie and they said
the programs were neatly folded.  That was me.

332
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:18,860
Yeah, yeah.  What do they say
about the production?

333
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,249
Ooh, "not since Hudson Hawk
has there been

334
00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:25,666
such a over-produced
under-directed piece of drek."

335
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,022
Hack.

336
00:22:27,022 --> 00:22:31,650
Oh, that's all right, Mister Sheffield.
Next year you could fold the programs.
