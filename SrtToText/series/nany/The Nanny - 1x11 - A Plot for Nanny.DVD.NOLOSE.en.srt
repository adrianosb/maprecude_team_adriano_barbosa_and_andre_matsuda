1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,868
Happy birthday to you.

2
00:00:05,868 --> 00:00:07,797
Yeh!
/ Thank you.

3
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:11,166
How old are you now?
How old are you -

4
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:14,269
Ma, watch it.
I still got a wish coming.

5
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:20,374
Darling, it's not how old
you are, it's how you look.

6
00:00:20,374 --> 00:00:22,472
And you look gorgeous.

7
00:00:22,472 --> 00:00:24,858
Am I right, Max?
/ Absolutely, Syl.

8
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,068
When I was your age,
I was a cow.

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,361
That was right
after I had her.

10
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:34,946
Ma, please, you were stuffing yourself
with pastrami up until the birth.

11
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:38,325
I'm surprised I wasn't born
with a pickle in my mouth.

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,121
Here you are, as promised,
two front row seats to Les Miserables.

13
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:43,285
Happy Birthday.

14
00:00:43,285 --> 00:00:49,147
Oh, I'm thirty and
I'm dating my mother.
And they think they're miserable.

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,531
Miss Fine, some things just
get better with age.
Like a fine Bordeaux.

16
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:58,083
Or a nice slab of blue cheese
getting good and moldy.

17
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:02,064
Why don't you just stick me in
the Menorah Village Retirement Hotel?

18
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:04,581
Grandma Yetta loves it there.

19
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:07,657
Grandma Yetta thinks
she's in Paris.

20
00:01:07,657 --> 00:01:09,296
Oh, my God, oh my God,
oh my God.

21
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:11,942
Maggie has found religion.

22
00:01:11,942 --> 00:01:13,391
What's the matter,
sweetheart?

23
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:16,781
Cindy told Whitney that she heard
through Martha and Philip.../ Oh, honey...

24
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:20,627
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!
/ Hang in, hang in, what is it?  What is it?

25
00:01:20,627 --> 00:01:23,019
That Philip Drake is
gonna ask me out!

26
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:26,370
Oh my God!  Oh my God!
Oh my God!

27
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,454
I am so, so happy for you.

28
00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:32,706
Just on the night that my life
is ending, hers is just beginning.

29
00:01:32,706 --> 00:01:34,873
Darling, I have a surprise for you.

30
00:01:34,873 --> 00:01:38,640
Oh, Ma, please, you already
gave me the Chanel cologne.

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,048
Parfume.

32
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:45,291
And I love it.  But you're spoiling me.
/ My pleasure.  Here.

33
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:48,041
This isn't another membership
for Great Expectations?

34
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,410
No, I've given up on that.
Think real estate.

35
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,485
Condo?
/ Smaller.

36
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:56,492
Time share?
/ Smaller.

37
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:59,198
A cemetery plot?

38
00:02:53,793 --> 00:02:57,019
I can't believe you would
buy me a cemetery plot.

39
00:02:57,019 --> 00:02:59,970
I don't even have
a good winter coat.

40
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:02,506
Actually,
I bought four plots.

41
00:03:02,506 --> 00:03:05,758
Two for me and your father,
and two for you and -

42
00:03:05,758 --> 00:03:10,366
The lucky guy?
/ It's gonna happen, knock wood.

43
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:13,182
Just kidding.

44
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:18,979
Ma
/ Oh, what a lovely model.

45
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:22,753
But why do they have a satin lining?
Satin doesn't breathe.

46
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:25,983
And neither will you.

47
00:03:25,983 --> 00:03:30,833
Meanwhile, a person could drop dead
just waiting to get service around this joint.

48
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,352
You want some blush?

49
00:03:32,352 --> 00:03:35,782
What?  I'm gonna get all dolled up
for some creepy funeral director?

50
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,072
You never know.  He could
turn out to be gorgeous.

51
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:42,332
Yeah, right.  I'm sure he had
a common career choice:

52
00:03:42,332 --> 00:03:45,136
male model or mortician.

53
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:46,922
Hi.

54
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:52,297
Hi!
/ I'm Steve Mintz.

55
00:03:52,297 --> 00:03:54,555
I'm really sorry to keep you waiting.
/ Oh, that's okay.

56
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:57,644
In your business, what's the rush?

57
00:03:57,644 --> 00:03:59,434
Hi, Stevie.
/ Hi, Syl.

58
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:00,912
How you been?
/ Good.

59
00:04:00,912 --> 00:04:05,913
This is my daughter, Fran.
/ Hi.  Stevie?  You guys know each other?

60
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,785
Oh, we met at a funeral.

61
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:11,969
At least no one could say Marsha
Silverberg died for nothing.

62
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:17,781
So you set me up?  These plots were
a plot?  Ma, I'm gonna kill you.

63
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:20,979
Well, at least they won't
have far to move me.

64
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:25,627
Steve, you know those four plots
my mother bought. / Oh, sure.
The two for one sale.

65
00:04:25,627 --> 00:04:29,966
A sale?  Ma, not only are you
giving me away, but I'm marked down?

66
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:32,244
Only the best for
you, darling.

67
00:04:32,244 --> 00:04:36,100
Twenty-five is
a very important birthday.

68
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:41,545
Anyway, I'd like to return them.
/ Really?

69
00:04:41,545 --> 00:04:44,165
You haven't even
tried them out yet.

70
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:48,274
Look, I'm sure it's a lovely plot,
and I'd look gorgeous in it, but -

71
00:04:48,274 --> 00:04:50,404
Your husband made
some other arrangements?

72
00:04:50,404 --> 00:04:53,853
She doesn't have a husband!

73
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:58,243
I'm sorry.  Did he pass on?
/ First he should only pass by.

74
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,247
You know, you two have
so much in common.

75
00:05:02,247 --> 00:05:05,368
Fran is a licensed
cosmetologist.

76
00:05:05,368 --> 00:05:08,758
And Stevie does
make-up, too.

77
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:11,501
Ma, you're killing me here.

78
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:13,893
Don't be embarrassed.
My mother's even worse.

79
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:17,004
No.  Mine is.
/ No, really.  Mine.

80
00:05:17,004 --> 00:05:22,576
This is a picture of Fran in the third
grade production of Fiddler On The Roof.

81
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:28,729
Isn't she adorable?  Matchmaker,
matchmaker, make me a match -

82
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,030
Get out of here.

83
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:33,731
You win.

84
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,994
Look, Fran, I'd be more than happy
to give you your money back,

85
00:05:38,994 --> 00:05:42,081
but let me see what I can
do for you here, huh.

86
00:05:42,081 --> 00:05:45,241
All right, dazzle me.
/ Okay.

87
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:50,370
I will upgrade you to a mausoleum
with a beautiful sunset view.

88
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,305
Oh, no way.  Then I'd get all the
fumes from the Cross-Bronx Expressway.

89
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:58,447
Not to mention the noise.
/ Well, we've never had any complaints.

90
00:05:58,447 --> 00:06:03,605
Look, Steve, you know, you do
make dying so very attractive.

91
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:07,916
But, uh, I just don't like
to plan quite so far in advance.

92
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,322
Well, then, how 'bout tonight?

93
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:13,069
What?  And skip old age?

94
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:16,449
Actually, I was
thinking about dinner.

95
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:21,444
Oh, well that's very flattering.
I just don't know if I'm available -

96
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:24,000
How old are you now?

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,304
You got something in her size?

98
00:06:36,558 --> 00:06:39,085
Oh, thank you, Fran, for letting
me borrow your clothes.

99
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:44,551
Oh, that's what women do. There's
one Chanel suit.  It travels the globe.

100
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:48,056
Oh man, I can't believe
I'm going out with Philip.

101
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:51,038
I can't believe
I'm going out with Steve.

102
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,421
Philip is so cool and deep.

103
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:58,028
Steve keeps people cool
and deep.

104
00:06:58,571 --> 00:07:01,595
Doesn't it give you the creeps
going out with an undertaker?

105
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,538
Well, maybe when
I was twenty-nine.

106
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:07,126
But now that I'm thirty,
I'm a little more -

107
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:09,461
Desperate?

108
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,646
You wanna borrow those
clothes or what?

109
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:16,848
I hope I'm sophisticated enough
for this coffee house.

110
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:21,719
I mean, I don't even know the difference
between French Roast,  Mocha Java, or Colombian.

111
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:25,758
Oh, nobody does unless
you're Juan Valdez.

112
00:07:27,295 --> 00:07:30,574
Do yourself a favor, just order
water.  But nothing with bubbles.

113
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:34,104
It's hard to sound profound
when you belch.

114
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:37,690
Fran, you can't go out.
Who's gonna read to me?

115
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,648
Oh, honey, would I leave you hanging
in chapter thirty-seven?

116
00:07:41,648 --> 00:07:46,360
Look, I made you a tape.
Scruples, a dramatic reading by Fran Fine.

117
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,024
Scruples, Miss Fine?

118
00:07:48,024 --> 00:07:52,122
What, we can't both enjoy the story?
I edit out the racy parts.

119
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:56,271
Oh, Fran, I need some help with
my history paper. / Oh, what kind of help?

120
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:58,952
Well, you know, picking out
a topic, doing the research,

121
00:07:58,952 --> 00:08:01,053
writing it up.
And oh yeah, do you type?

122
00:08:01,053 --> 00:08:05,096
Oh, what the heck was that?
I thought I saw a pig fly by.

123
00:08:05,672 --> 00:08:08,746
Oh, there's my date.
Now don't embarrass me, please.

124
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:10,839
You all know how
difficult this is.

125
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:14,701
I don't want any corny jokes about
Steve being a funeral director.

126
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:18,151
We'll try, but it's
quite an undertaking.

127
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,964
We may be getting
in over our heads.

128
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:26,122
Hi, Steve.
/ Hi.

129
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:28,098
Family, house.
Gotta go.  Bye.

130
00:08:28,098 --> 00:08:30,519
Miss Fine, Miss Fine,
where are your manners?

131
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,975
Come on in.  Let me fix
you a cup of coffin.

132
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:36,757
Coffee.  No, no, no.
Accident, I swear.

133
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:41,002
You know, I could chaperon for you.
/ Over my dead body.

134
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:44,591
Thank you, thank you.
No hands, no hands.

135
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,666
"Trembling with desire,
she looked deep in his eyes,

136
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,111
slipped off her negligee

137
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:03,982
and folded it neatly, brushed her
teeth and got a good night's sleep."

138
00:09:04,972 --> 00:09:09,202
Gracie, sweetheart, it's almost
ten o'clock. Why aren't you in bed?

139
00:09:09,202 --> 00:09:12,482
Fran's so good,
I can't put her down.

140
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:15,889
I finished my homework, Dad.
/ Oh, all right.  Let's have a listen.

141
00:09:16,827 --> 00:09:20,472
The Civil War.  The causes of
the Civil War become clear

142
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:23,670
when we view the United States
as a big dysfunctional family.

143
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,375
Oh, Grace, I told you not to do
your brother's homework.

144
00:09:27,885 --> 00:09:30,517
Five bucks is five bucks.

145
00:09:31,631 --> 00:09:35,574
Brighton, you can't just go through
life paying people to do everything for you.

146
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:38,960
Dad, I've got two words for you.
Niles.  Fran.

147
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:41,258
I've got two words for you.

148
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:43,561
Military school.

149
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:48,779
Hey, what did I do?  This is all
your fault for letting Fran start dating.

150
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,182
You think I should keep
her chained up in her room?

151
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:53,724
Well, yeah.  You know something.

152
00:09:53,724 --> 00:09:57,548
Dad, if you let her go out there and
see what it's like, she may never come back.

153
00:09:57,548 --> 00:09:59,860
You'd actually miss her,
wouldn't you?

154
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,403
Well, yeah.

155
00:10:01,403 --> 00:10:05,061
You know, because then there'd
be no one to do my homework.

156
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:06,596
Yeah, right.

157
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:11,755
"And they lived happily
ever after.  The end."

158
00:10:11,755 --> 00:10:15,733
Now tuck yourself in and tomorrow
we'll start another classic,

159
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:19,639
"The Valley of
the Barbie Dolls."

160
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,521
Goodnight, sweetheart.
/ Goodnight, Fran.

161
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:26,790
And don't get so close to
the T.V., you'll get cancer.

162
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,565
Ah, thank you, Niles.

163
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:51,762
Cigar?

164
00:10:51,762 --> 00:10:53,825
Don't mind if I do.

165
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,535
Will there be anything
else, sir?

166
00:11:03,824 --> 00:11:05,892
Oh, is that the London Times?

167
00:11:07,111 --> 00:11:08,288
Hmm -

168
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:13,856
You know, my pajamas are
about your size.

169
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:22,634
Well, apparently Miss Fine's
date's going very well. / Hm-hmm.

170
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:33,406
Awfully quiet in this house, isn't it?
/ Really?  I hadn't noticed.

171
00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:38,297
So, what do you think of this
nasty business in the Middle East, huh?

172
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:42,428
It's something I would like
to read about in my off time,

173
00:11:42,428 --> 00:11:46,105
which technically began at eight.

174
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:50,678
Oh.  Well, I'll, uh, I'll just -

175
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:54,368
If you're at loose ends, sir,
why don't you sort the recycling?

176
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:56,070
Good idea.

177
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:00,054
Way to be politically conscious, sir.

178
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:04,096
You realize how much the children will
actually miss Miss Fine if she were to leave?

179
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:07,660
Good God, man, it's just a first date!

180
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,168
Speaking as one who's off the clock.

181
00:12:11,168 --> 00:12:13,035
Well, uh, you're absolutely right.

182
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:15,328
First dates are usually
a nightmare, aren't they?

183
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:18,595
Indeed, if mine
are any indication.

184
00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:21,295
And after all,
he is an undertaker.

185
00:12:21,295 --> 00:12:24,742
I can't see anything
between them.

186
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,817
And I can't see anything
between them, either.

187
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:44,792
Philip is so intense.  We spent hours
discussing the nature of consciousness

188
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:47,702
and whether or not something
really exists.  Like this table.

189
00:12:47,702 --> 00:12:50,186
Is it really here, or is it
only here because we see it?

190
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,558
And if we weren't here to see it,
would it disappear?

191
00:12:52,558 --> 00:12:57,463
Maggie, sweetheart, next time you
go to a coffee house, try decaf.

192
00:12:59,536 --> 00:13:03,562
So, Miss Fine, I take it
your date went well.

193
00:13:03,562 --> 00:13:07,873
Well, it was pretty fabulous.

194
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:12,387
You know, Fran, you gotta get
this guy out of your system.

195
00:13:12,387 --> 00:13:15,854
I mean, I've got
mid-terms coming up.

196
00:13:15,854 --> 00:13:19,341
I've got middle-age coming up.
I win.

197
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:23,618
Okay, kids, we should get going.
You don't wanna be late for school.

198
00:13:23,618 --> 00:13:28,662
I can't wait for lunch.  Philip invited
me to sit at his table with his friends.

199
00:13:28,662 --> 00:13:31,402
But does Philip's
table really exist?

200
00:13:31,402 --> 00:13:35,256
And when you show up,
will they all disappear?

201
00:13:35,536 --> 00:13:38,840
Well, Niles, it seems that
love is in the air.

202
00:13:39,794 --> 00:13:42,610
I suppose it's time to have
that birds and bees talk.

203
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,969
I would have thought you'd have done
that by now.  Miss Margaret is fourteen.

204
00:13:45,969 --> 00:13:48,817
Not Maggie.
Oh, don't even say that.

205
00:13:48,817 --> 00:13:51,335
No, I, I meant Miss Fine.

206
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:54,343
I suspect she knows, sir.

207
00:13:54,343 --> 00:13:58,337
And if I may be so bold,
I'd say she's way ahead of you.

208
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,470
Yeah, exactly.  That's why I want you,
as a senior member of my domestic staff,

209
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,523
to make Miss Fine aware of
the rules of the house.

210
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:08,388
Well, you know what
I'm talking about.

211
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:11,250
Spell it out for me, sir.

212
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,700
You know, no pets, no loud music,
no boyfriends in her room.

213
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,773
I understand completely.
/ Oh good, so you'll tell her.

214
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,514
No bloody way.

215
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:22,694
How very disobliging of you.

216
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:25,427
Oh, we never had this problem
with the other nannies, did we?

217
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:29,371
No, sir.  Although if I recall correctly,
Nanny Carpart was a handsome woman.

218
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:32,377
That was probably the sideburns.

219
00:14:38,438 --> 00:14:41,415
Good morning, Niles. / Hm-hmm.

220
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:45,031
Oh, thank you.  I am famished.

221
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,544
Napkin?

222
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:50,470
Well, well, no barbs?
No wise cracks?

223
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,834
Niles, have you been taking
butler lessons?

224
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:56,506
I'm lulling you into a false
sense of security.

225
00:14:56,506 --> 00:15:00,120
Where's Maxwell? / He's gone
upstairs to discuss with Miss Fine

226
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,045
the possibility of
having sex in her room.

227
00:15:11,265 --> 00:15:13,914
Miss Fine, do you have a moment?
I - I hope I'm not intruding.

228
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,770
Sure, come on in.
My house is your house.

229
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,410
Oh, yeah, it is.

230
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:25,414
Take a load off. / Oh, thank you.
But I - I'd just as soon stand.

231
00:15:25,414 --> 00:15:28,037
Oh, well can you hold it?

232
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,370
I'm  just getting ready
for my lunch date.

233
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,977
Another date?  Already?
/ Well, I gotta eat.

234
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:38,044
Listen, this is
all very awkward.

235
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:40,901
I've not had to have this
conversation with the other nannies.

236
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:45,174
Of course, they weren't nearly
as attractive as you. / Oh, well -

237
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:51,239
Um, as master of this house, there
are certain things that I expect.

238
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:55,265
Oh, Mister Sheffield, maybe
I should have read the fine print.

239
00:15:55,265 --> 00:15:58,581
Oh, no, no, Miss, Miss Fine, you're,
you're taking this all wrong.

240
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:02,681
Here. / I - I need to talk
to you about your boyfriend.

241
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:04,930
Oh, I wouldn't call him
my boyfriend.

242
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,200
Well, he, he is a boy and
he is your friend.

243
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,421
Mister Sheffield, are you sure you're
in the right room?  I mean,
Maggie is two doors down.

244
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:16,307
No, I've already had this talk with Maggie.
/ Oh, well I hope it went better than this.

245
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:19,343
No, as a matter
of fact, it didn't.

246
00:16:19,343 --> 00:16:22,862
Miss Fine, what I'm trying to say is
if you are intent on having a fling,

247
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:27,517
then there are certain rules regarding
the proper places for a fling to be flung.

248
00:16:27,517 --> 00:16:33,160
H-hmm.  So I take it the previous
nannies never flang?

249
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,899
No, they, they were
not flingers.

250
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:41,874
Well, let me just clarify this.
We are talking about having sex
in my room, are we not?

251
00:16:41,874 --> 00:16:46,302
Oh, no, not, not, not us.
/ We already covered that.

252
00:16:46,302 --> 00:16:51,951
I assure you, Mister Sheffield,
I would never do anything to set
a bad example for the children.

253
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:54,659
Oh, well, thank you for that,
Miss Fine.

254
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:56,865
And I appreciate your discretion.

255
00:16:56,865 --> 00:17:01,256
Oh, well, thank you for holding my hair.
/ Anytime.

256
00:17:01,256 --> 00:17:04,182
If you want, I can return the favor
and wash that gray away.

257
00:17:04,182 --> 00:17:08,615
How long have you had that anyway?
/ Oh, it came in about the same time you did.

258
00:17:09,357 --> 00:17:11,321
What a coincidence.

259
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,327
Fran, be right there.

260
00:17:19,327 --> 00:17:23,423
Oh, no rush.
No one's going anywhere -

261
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,892
Hi.

262
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:45,782
Oh, hi, hi, hi, hi.  I mean, hi.

263
00:17:46,617 --> 00:17:49,647
Listen, thanks for meeting me here.
I would have picked you up,
but the car's being used.

264
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:53,562
Oh, no problem, no problem.
Here, I'll help you close up.

265
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:59,261
Oh, Steveala.  You sure it's
the right place? / Well -

266
00:17:59,261 --> 00:18:04,742
Although the satin lining
looks very comfy.

267
00:18:04,742 --> 00:18:09,111
You know, that's what I love about you.
You have got the greatest sense of humor.

268
00:18:09,111 --> 00:18:12,015
Oh, well so do you.
/ Yeah?  You really think so?

269
00:18:12,015 --> 00:18:16,143
Yeah.  Considering your chosen profession.
/ Well, it wasn't actually my choice.

270
00:18:16,143 --> 00:18:18,883
It's a family business that
I just sort of fell into.

271
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:21,524
Oh, well, there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

272
00:18:21,524 --> 00:18:26,247
It's a very respectable business,
and it doesn't bother me one bit.

273
00:18:26,247 --> 00:18:28,461
Well, it bothers me.

274
00:18:28,461 --> 00:18:32,597
Fran, I just can't stand to be around
all of this sadness day in and day out.

275
00:18:32,597 --> 00:18:35,696
Oh, honey, did you make
a wrong career choice.

276
00:18:35,696 --> 00:18:38,068
That's why I'm going back
to college to get my degree.

277
00:18:38,068 --> 00:18:40,933
Oh, a professional man.
/ Yep.

278
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:42,791
Doctor?
/ No.

279
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,066
Lawyer?
/ No.

280
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:49,384
Indian chief?
/ I'll give you a hint.

281
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,534
You're studying
to be Karl Malden?

282
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:01,665
No, a clown.
/ What?

283
00:19:01,665 --> 00:19:05,157
Fran, I'm going to
clown college.

284
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,458
Oh, Fran, don't
you get it?

285
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,888
See, I just wanna
make people happy.

286
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:22,591
Well, Fran,
you're not laughing.

287
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:24,201
I'm laughing

288
00:19:24,201 --> 00:19:26,943
on the inside.

289
00:19:26,943 --> 00:19:29,853
Where it's dry.

290
00:19:29,853 --> 00:19:31,547
All right, look, look,

291
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:34,285
I also do balloon
animals.  Here.

292
00:19:34,285 --> 00:19:36,025
Watch this.

293
00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:43,835
Gee, I hope
it's a four-year college.

294
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:48,624
I hate men.

295
00:19:48,624 --> 00:19:51,519
Well, take a number.
Take a spoon.

296
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:53,455
What are you eating?

297
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:57,065
I guess I'll have
my leftover birthday cake.

298
00:19:57,065 --> 00:20:00,364
Isn't that a little old?
/ What's your point?

299
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:03,957
I can't believe Philip.
What a phony.

300
00:20:03,957 --> 00:20:06,492
I caught him drooling
over some stupid cheerleader.

301
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:10,360
And after all the coffee
you drank for that man.

302
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:15,006
I thought we had something special.
/ Been there.

303
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:18,919
I thought I really knew him.
/ Am there.

304
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,215
And then out of nowhere
he hits me with this.

305
00:20:21,215 --> 00:20:23,735
It's like I've had cold water
thrown in my face.

306
00:20:23,735 --> 00:20:26,741
I know exactly how you feel.

307
00:20:27,164 --> 00:20:31,576
Picturing yourself married,
living in a split-level in Long Island

308
00:20:31,576 --> 00:20:36,715
with three kids and an Eldorado
in the driveway. / No.

309
00:20:37,294 --> 00:20:40,273
But I did have hopes
for the weekend.

310
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:43,351
Hello, ladies.
Ice cream, cake.

311
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:45,309
Man trouble?

312
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:48,061
I hate Philip.
I'm never talking to him again.

313
00:20:48,061 --> 00:20:50,569
Miss Margaret,
it's Master Philip.

314
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:53,381
Oh my God!  Oh my God!
Oh my God!

315
00:20:54,051 --> 00:20:56,138
Ah, youth.

316
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:58,358
You know, Fran,
when I'm depressed,

317
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:01,359
it always makes me feel better
to help other people.

318
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,808
I have an essay I'd be willing
to let you write for me.

319
00:21:04,808 --> 00:21:08,511
Brighton, my darling,
I'm at your beck and call.

320
00:21:08,511 --> 00:21:12,436
I'll be home every night.
I have no life.

321
00:21:12,436 --> 00:21:16,256
We're awfully sorry, Miss Fine.
/ Oh, we sure are.

322
00:21:20,743 --> 00:21:23,159
So, what, what happened?

323
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:27,168
Did you find dating
a mortician a bit too macabre?

324
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:31,678
Oh, I did at first,
but I got used to the idea.

325
00:21:31,678 --> 00:21:34,512
And then he turns out
to be a clown.

326
00:21:34,512 --> 00:21:35,863
How do you mean?

327
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:39,030
I mean a clown.

328
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,709
In what way? / The usual way.

329
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:47,550
Red hair, baggy pants, floppy shoes.
Do I have to draw you a picture?

330
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:52,410
And to think I came this close
to being Mrs. Bozo.

331
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:59,082
All the world loves a clown.
Why can't you?

332
00:21:59,082 --> 00:22:04,204
Twenty-seven guys in one little car.
I can't even stand to share a cab.

333
00:22:04,204 --> 00:22:09,264
Sharing is what marriage is all about.
What are you looking for anyway?

334
00:22:09,264 --> 00:22:14,543
Ma, I'm not asking for much.
Just a guy that doesn't wear
as much make-up as I do.

335
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:17,628
Well, what are you waiting for?
You think Mister Right

336
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:21,138
is just gonna walk right up,
knock on your door and say,

337
00:22:21,138 --> 00:22:23,301
"Here I am."

338
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:25,893
Ah, there you are.
That's good.  Here.

339
00:22:25,893 --> 00:22:29,542
Which tie, the yellow or the green?
/ Green, it goes better with your eyes.

340
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:34,885
Thanks. / Ma, I just want a guy
that I can respect, that respects me.

341
00:22:34,885 --> 00:22:38,332
Oh, I'm sorry to bother you again,
it's just that I value your opinion.

342
00:22:38,332 --> 00:22:43,315
Gold, gold or tiger's eye cufflinks?
/ Gold.  Simple, elegant.

343
00:22:43,315 --> 00:22:48,529
Right. / Who knows, Ma.  I just
think maybe someday he'll come along.

344
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:53,670
Fran, open your eyes.
Life just doesn't work like that.

345
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:09,160
Steve could be very successful.

346
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,107
Look at Ronald McDonald.
He's got his own corporation now.

347
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,907
I'm not gonna spend my nights
polishing big shoes, Ma.

348
00:23:16,907 --> 00:23:18,786
Are you gonna be
single your whole life?

349
00:23:18,786 --> 00:23:22,825
Oh, I could just see the wedding.
He'll slip on a banana peel
while walking down the aisle.

350
00:23:22,825 --> 00:23:27,181
Look at the bright side.
Instead of two rings,
you'll have three.

351
00:23:30,758 --> 00:23:33,277
Shut the door, Ma.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
