1
00:00:08,117 --> 00:00:09,367
Niles.
/ Huh?

2
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:13,000
Brighten says my uniform
makes me look like a dork.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,613
I wear a uniform.
Do I look like a dork?

4
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:22,334
Remember what happened to Gretel ...

5
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:28,071
I see we've customized
our Red Robin uniform.

6
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:31,344
Believe me,
you sell more cookies my way.

7
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:33,229
Does anybody know what today is?

8
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:35,785
Another one of your colorful
holidays involving plagues?

9
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:41,409
Hey, don't knock the Jewish holidays.
They get you out of more school than mono.

10
00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:46,618
No.  One year ago today was the day
that Danny dumped me for Heather Biblow,

11
00:00:46,618 --> 00:00:53,799
which would make one year ago tomorrow the day
that Heather found Nair in her Pert Plus,

12
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:58,501
which would make Friday the day that
she bought her first Ava Gabor wig.

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,417
Grab the wheel, Miss Fine,
you're swerving.

14
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:04,403
Oh.  Sorry.

15
00:01:04,403 --> 00:01:08,463
Which would make Saturday the first anniversary
of the day that I started to work here.

16
00:01:08,463 --> 00:01:11,780
Oh, it seems like only yesterday
when you called the Orkin Man

17
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,910
when I served escargot.

18
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,985
I don't care how rich you are, you don't eat
something that leaves a trail of slime behind it.

19
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:23,066
Oh, don't you look adorable in that uniform.

20
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh, Mr. Sheffield.
/ I was talking to Grace, Miss Fine.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,037
Oh .../ But you do look... well, I know
Robin's are always prepared, but for what?

22
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:37,766
Oh, you're just going to have
to earn a merit badge to find out.

23
00:01:37,949 --> 00:01:41,270
It was very sweet of you to volunteer
to be Grace's troop mother, Miss Fine.

24
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,121
Oh, my pleasure.

25
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:47,389
That's the last time I ever
scratch my armpit in public.

26
00:01:50,715 --> 00:01:53,933
Miss Fine, will you be
free Saturday night?

27
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:56,000
Saturday?  Why?

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,329
Well, I'd rather not discuss it.
I just want to be sure you can be here.

29
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:03,717
I'm all yours, and
I have been for a year.

30
00:02:05,145 --> 00:02:08,520
Oh, I can't believe he remembered.
Is he a doll or what?

31
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,460
You know, if he asks, I don't
expect anything Size 5.

32
00:02:13,913 --> 00:02:19,200
I have never felt so wanted or
appreciated Bloomingdales, 3rd floor.

33
00:02:19,911 --> 00:02:24,138
Well, I just hope he doesn't go
overboard diamonds are forever.

34
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,707
Okay, Red Robins, now survival tips.

35
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:22,019
Listen closely because the proper
knot can save your life.

36
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:27,344
You're in the woods, you look around,
all of a sudden you squish a bug right here.

37
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:33,810
Well, the proper slip knot, not
only can conceal those unwanted bug guts,

38
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,282
but it also creates a flattering neckline
and gives the illusion of cleavage.

39
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:42,624
You're a born leader, Miss Fine.

40
00:03:42,624 --> 00:03:45,522
Well, you know, I was leader of
my Weight Watchers group.

41
00:03:45,522 --> 00:03:47,272
You had a weight problem? / Oh, yeah.

42
00:03:47,272 --> 00:03:51,616
I once woke up with a Milky Way in my mouth.
I still don't know how it got there ...

43
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:56,829
Where you going? / Oh, we're going down
to Macy's to buy a present for someone.

44
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:59,920
Not you.
/ Yeah, for my friend...

45
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,782
Mark.
/ Oh, Mark.  What are you getting him?

46
00:04:02,782 --> 00:04:05,347
Chanel No. 5.

47
00:04:05,738 --> 00:04:09,748
Oh, well, perhaps Mark would enjoy
a lighter, more floral scent.

48
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:11,604
Jean Nate, Le Detante.

49
00:04:11,604 --> 00:04:16,249
It's the thought that counts.
Take your father's credit card ...

50
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,429
Okay, ladies, now today's field trip

51
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:25,024
we're going to my grandma's
retirement home,

52
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:29,589
and you're each going to adopt
your very own grandma.

53
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:32,788
What's the pink tissue for?
/ Oh, give that to your grandma.

54
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:37,570
It makes a lovely wrist and
brassiere strap ornament.

55
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:44,584
Nanny Fine, you are not going to make those
decrepit old ladies feel any younger

56
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:51,290
by bringing in these vibrant, wrinkle
free girls.  This is not "Cocoon."

57
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:57,417
Well, how would you feel if you were alone
and forgotten without any friends?

58
00:04:57,417 --> 00:05:00,291
Oh, bad example.

59
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:06,071
I know when I'm old I'd rather be
in a dark room with the drapes drawn,

60
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:10,893
the mirrors covered, and a really
big bottle of Nyquil.

61
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:14,569
Not me.  I'm going to be
a platinum blond prune

62
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:21,081
down in Miami just pulling up my tube top
and cha-cha-cha-ing with the cabana boys.

63
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:23,470
I'd rather die young.

64
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,630
And we're all pulling for you.

65
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,576
We don't go young in my family.
No.  We Fines like to linger

66
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:39,556
and be a burden to others for
as long as possible.

67
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,562
Okay, Red Robins,
now remember your manners.

68
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:51,386
No loud noises, and whatever you do,
don't unplug anything.

69
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:55,872
Cupcakes, tissues okay, go find
your grandmas and introduce yourselves ...

70
00:05:56,016 --> 00:05:58,415
Hi, Grandma Yetta.

71
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:04,404
Boy, are you a big robin.
What?  Were you left back?

72
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:06,329
Yetta, it's Fran.

73
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:10,337
Fran?  Where's Kukla and Ollie.

74
00:06:11,474 --> 00:06:16,285
Yetta, if you're going to live
in the past, pick the Renaissance.

75
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:19,666
Why didn't you sign up for
a Red Robin like everybody else.

76
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,233
Because I'm not a joiner.

77
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:29,202
Look at them.  Staring at Jeopardy like
they know European Monarchs for 500.

78
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:33,505
Most of them can't remember
their room number.

79
00:06:33,505 --> 00:06:37,366
Oh, Gracie, honey, why aren't you
talking to your new grandma?

80
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:41,415
Mrs. Cramer wasn't in her room.
They said she checked out.

81
00:06:41,415 --> 00:06:46,426
Maybe she moved to Florida.
/ No.  They said she bought a farm.

82
00:06:47,697 --> 00:06:51,458
Farm?  The woman couldn't grow a wart.

83
00:06:52,285 --> 00:06:57,006
Well, maybe she was going to
the well to kick the bucket?

84
00:06:57,006 --> 00:07:00,316
Oh, you don't have to paint
me a picture.

85
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:05,980
Gracie, sweetie, the grandma that was
assigned to you passed away.

86
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,893
Oh, can I eat her cupcake?

87
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:13,043
Sure, sweetie.
Kids are so resillent.

88
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:17,365
Honey, I'm so sorry.  You were definitely
supposed to get a live one.

89
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:20,147
Fran, Cramer's room was
on a corner.

90
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:22,852
That's cross ventilation, Yetta.

91
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:25,438
Has anyone moved in yet?

92
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:31,088
Bye.

93
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:34,698
Bye, my beautiful Red Robins.

94
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:40,022
Fly...  Fly...  Fly...

95
00:07:40,022 --> 00:07:42,919
the hell out of here.

96
00:07:43,948 --> 00:07:50,081
I am guessing the field trip was less than a total
success considering there was a body count.

97
00:07:50,852 --> 00:07:53,581
Fran, I don't want to be
a Red Robin anymore.

98
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:57,187
Oh, come on, honey.
One old lady dies on you

99
00:07:57,187 --> 00:08:02,227
and you're already turned off
to the whole Red Robin experience?

100
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:08,728
I'll get it.  Sit down and relax.
We'll watch court TV.

101
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:09,627
Who's on?

102
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:13,803
The Menendez boys.
They're back for a second season.

103
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:19,386
Hello, I'm Mrs. Livingston,
Heather's mother.

104
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:21,127
Oh, come in.

105
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:25,450
Is that Heather with the freckles
or Heather with the extra pinkie?

106
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:29,589
Oh, it's a real treat watching
her sip tea.

107
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:33,373
Miss Fine, this is a little awkward.
We're making a change in our domestic staff,

108
00:08:33,373 --> 00:08:36,898
and the kids all say such great
things about the Sheffield home.

109
00:08:36,898 --> 00:08:40,240
Well, in the short year
that I've been here,

110
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,741
I have added a certain element
of style and panache to this house.

111
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:49,018
Huh?  When did I eat corn?

112
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:53,284
Miss Fine, let me finish.
/ No.  It's very flattering,

113
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:56,935
but I can't even consider it
even if you doubled my salary

114
00:08:56,935 --> 00:09:01,795
and offered me an Eldorado
in the Bill Blast color scheme,

115
00:09:01,795 --> 00:09:05,127
I'd have to turn you down.
Who'd pay the insurance?

116
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,278
Not you, Miss Fine...  Niles.

117
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:10,981
Niles would pay my insurance?

118
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:13,445
No, we want Niles.

119
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:16,158
Could you just find out for us
if he's happy here?

120
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:19,767
Oh ...  Well, what is it,
that fancy English accent?

121
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:24,508
Because, you know, if I wanted to,
I could talk with an accent too.

122
00:09:30,423 --> 00:09:32,760
What was wrong with the blouse
I picked out for Fran?

123
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,479
Oh, no.  It was cheap and incredibly tacky.
You could see right through it.

124
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:39,293
And what's the downside of that?

125
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:42,714
I want to get her something
she doesn't already have.

126
00:09:43,463 --> 00:09:45,071
Hi, kids.

127
00:09:45,071 --> 00:09:47,650
Fran, if you were ... ah ...

128
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,313
Mark?
/ Yeah, Mark.

129
00:09:51,287 --> 00:09:53,806
Mark ...
/ Would you like a pair of earrings?

130
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:56,670
Oh, I think Mark would
love the earrings.

131
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,055
Just make sure they're clip-ons.

132
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:01,056
Mark doesn't have pierced ears?

133
00:10:01,056 --> 00:10:05,392
No, his lobes are too fatty.
It runs in his family.

134
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:09,853
Mr. Sheffield.  I hope
I'm not bothering you

135
00:10:09,853 --> 00:10:14,356
like you're talking to some caterer
about something... shrimp cocktail, rumaki.

136
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:19,441
Miss Fine, we're in a bit of a crunch here.
Do you have anything to say
that's even remotely comprehensible?

137
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:22,773
Oh, all right, all right.
But I did want to tell you this in private.

138
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:24,840
Follow my eyes?

139
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,005
What?  You don't want to talk
in front of the lamp?

140
00:10:28,288 --> 00:10:31,316
What?  Oh, Niles, oh, you can
speak freely in front of him.

141
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:36,317
We have no secrets in this house.
/ That's because he listens at the door.

142
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:41,027
How else would I hear you scratching
to get back in?

143
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:50,200
Well, someone is trying to hire away one of
your most valued domestic employees.

144
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,689
Niles.

145
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:55,643
Well, I didn't say that, but,
yeah, Niles.  How'd you guess?

146
00:10:55,837 --> 00:10:59,938
Well, there's scarcely a day goes by when
I don't get a telephone call requesting Niles.

147
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:03,854
An employee of his skills and
breeding is always in demand.

148
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:06,141
I'm hot.

149
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:09,354
Well, next time you get one of
those calls for me,

150
00:11:09,354 --> 00:11:12,336
you just tell them I'm not interested.

151
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:15,555
Will do, Miss Fine.

152
00:11:16,512 --> 00:11:19,326
What's so funny?
/ Oh, nothing.

153
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:23,275
No one ever calls for me?
/ Well, actually, there was one.

154
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:25,436
See.
/ Your mother.

155
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:30,163
Clairol's Loving Care
gives better coverage.

156
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:32,934
What are you telling me that for?

157
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:37,447
Nanny Fine, I don't want to be rude
/  Huh, since when?

158
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,413
You're right.  Get out.

159
00:11:39,413 --> 00:11:42,043
We need to talk about Saturday night.
What time do you want me here?

160
00:11:42,043 --> 00:11:45,933
She's coming?  Oh, we're going to have
to talk about this guest list.

161
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:49,679
Well, of course, Miss Babcock's coming.
She made all the arrangements.

162
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,435
Oh, boy, did I have you
pegged all wrong.

163
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:57,179
Isn't it the people you hate on sight
that become your lifelong friends.

164
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:59,312
Not always.

165
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:03,213
Maxwell, the limousine will pick us
up at the airport in Washington.

166
00:12:03,213 --> 00:12:06,575
Washington?
/ Yes.  Well, you may as well know.

167
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:11,604
The Center for Performing Arts has
nominated us for its highest award.

168
00:12:11,604 --> 00:12:16,214
Is that what you wanted me
for on Saturday night?  To baby-sit?

169
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:19,946
No.  We wanted you to fly the jet.

170
00:12:20,284 --> 00:12:23,628
Miss Fine, I didn't say anything to you
before about the nomination

171
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:27,897
because it's bad luck, you know,
we've been overlooked so many times before.

172
00:12:27,897 --> 00:12:29,841
You've been overlooked?

173
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:32,569
Is there a problem, Miss Fine?
Do you have plans Saturday night.

174
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:34,791
Oh, yeah, I'm going to heat
up a Lean Cuisine

175
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:39,793
and see what kind of frontier mishegaas
Dr. Quinn has gotten herself into.

176
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:53,966
Gracie, you're going to love
your new grandma, Mrs. Klein.

177
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:56,469
Now do you remember what
I told you to ask her?

178
00:12:56,469 --> 00:13:01,835
Is she related to Calvin and can
we get a discount. / Excellent.

179
00:13:01,835 --> 00:13:05,125
Good morning.  And how are
you two ladies doing today?

180
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,966
Fine, Daddy.
/ I've been better.

181
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:11,962
Is everything... everything all right,
Miss Fine? / Oh, whatever.

182
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:15,180
Miss Fine, is there
something bothering you?

183
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,160
No, what could possibly be
bothering me?  (Mumble.)

184
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,475
I beg your pardon?
/ Nothing.

185
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:27,438
Miss Fine, you've barely spoken
a word to me in 12 hours.
It's beginning to scare me.

186
00:13:27,438 --> 00:13:29,539
I have no idea what you're talking about.

187
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:32,453
I invited my mother.  I'll never hear
the end of it.  Come on, Gracie.

188
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:36,040
Miss Fine, you are not leaving this house
until I know why you're so upset with me.

189
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,755
I'm not upset with you.  You're the best
boss anyone could possibly ask for.

190
00:13:40,755 --> 00:13:43,365
Eat tripe and die.

191
00:13:50,768 --> 00:13:54,196
Now, Gracie, I had
Mrs. Klein thoroughly checked out.

192
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:59,116
She's cute, she's sweet, and
she's healthy as a horse.

193
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:06,698
You know, she holds the retirement home
record for most reps on the thigh burner.

194
00:14:06,698 --> 00:14:08,532
One.

195
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:13,593
Oh ... Grandma Yetta.

196
00:14:13,593 --> 00:14:17,294
We're here to introduce Gracie
to her new grandma, Mrs. Klein.

197
00:14:17,294 --> 00:14:22,685
Oh, yeah?  Well, if you want to talk to her,
you're going to need a Ouija board.

198
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:26,745
She never should have gone
for that second rep.

199
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,957
Another one?

200
00:14:28,957 --> 00:14:32,146
What if it's me?
What if I'm a jinx?

201
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:37,258
Oh, no, honey,
now that is just ridiculous.

202
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:40,575
There's no such thing.  Poi, poi.

203
00:14:41,554 --> 00:14:46,060
People here are old and sick.
They can go at any time, in the next minute.

204
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,634
Would you go cheer somebody else up.

205
00:14:50,634 --> 00:14:56,973
Sweetie, you're an adorable little girl and
anyone would love to be your grandma; right?

206
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:10,883
You're not a jinx, and just to prove it to you,
I'm going to give you my very own grandma.

207
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:12,687
Yetta ...

208
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,429
Damn crepe soles stick like gum.

209
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,789
Honey, I'd love to be your grandma.

210
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,351
I've lived a good life.

211
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:29,617
So then she said that Heather was a liar,

212
00:15:29,617 --> 00:15:34,959
so then Heather said -- no,
wait -- oh, yeah

213
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,330
-- no, wait -- oh, yeah.

214
00:15:37,732 --> 00:15:39,665
Let me start again.

215
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:44,469
See, honey, you're not
a jinx because I'm not dead.

216
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:47,577
And I wish I was.

217
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:52,804
Honey, why don't we play some
hide-and-go-seek. / Okay.  I'll hide.

218
00:15:52,804 --> 00:15:55,066
Good choice, sweetie.

219
00:15:56,018 --> 00:15:59,953
So what's the matter?
/ Who said anything's the matter?

220
00:15:59,953 --> 00:16:03,737
Franny, I know I like
the back of my hand.

221
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:06,715
Geez, I never noticed that before.

222
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:10,584
So, anyway, what is it?
Man trouble?

223
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:13,810
How could he not know
what's bothering me.

224
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,688
I don't know.  It's because
I'm like all the Fine women.

225
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:19,492
We're just too damn settle.

226
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:22,501
It's a waste of time talking to men.

227
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:26,716
First of all,
they aren't that interesting.

228
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:32,716
Sixty-two years I was married to your
grandfather, we didn't say two words.

229
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:36,181
The man had no communication skills.

230
00:16:36,181 --> 00:16:38,460
That's true.
If only he'd been able to say

231
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,793
"I'm choking on a chicken bone,"
he'd be alive today.

232
00:16:43,465 --> 00:16:46,590
So what is it?
Your sex life stinks?

233
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,916
Grandma, he doesn't sleep with me.

234
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:52,904
Not even on your birthday?
/ No.

235
00:16:52,904 --> 00:16:56,944
That's a bad marriage.
/ We're not married.

236
00:16:56,944 --> 00:17:01,452
Look at me, I'm hanging on every word
like I'm talking to Yoda.

237
00:17:17,396 --> 00:17:19,964
May I help you, sir?
/ Oh, that's all right, Niles.

238
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:22,615
I'm just counting forward
28 days from the last time

239
00:17:22,615 --> 00:17:26,595
Miss Fine seemed to hate my guts
for no apparent reason.

240
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,939
No, that will be next week.

241
00:17:29,184 --> 00:17:32,294
Um, something to look forward to, sir.

242
00:17:32,612 --> 00:17:35,857
Cee Cee, maybe you can shed
some light on this.  I mean you're a woman.

243
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:39,244
I'm still waiting for
the DNA results.

244
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:44,671
You men just don't get it.
She doesn't hate you.

245
00:17:44,671 --> 00:17:48,356
It's her life.
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

246
00:17:48,356 --> 00:17:50,951
She has a dead-end job
with no prospects.

247
00:17:50,951 --> 00:17:54,255
She's working for a man
who hardly knows she's alive.

248
00:17:54,255 --> 00:17:56,899
Her own dog hates her.

249
00:17:56,899 --> 00:18:00,964
A blind date stole her stereo.

250
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:05,756
Who was I talking about again?

251
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:09,177
Think back, sir,
one year ago today

252
00:18:09,177 --> 00:18:14,218
someone's spike heel dug its first
divot into the parquet floor.

253
00:18:14,557 --> 00:18:16,896
I thought you were
going to get that fixed.

254
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,884
Come closer.

255
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:26,638
One year to the day since we first
learned if it ain't half off, it ain't on sale.

256
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:30,501
Would you just... would you just
get to the point, old man.

257
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:33,028
Work with me, sir.

258
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,247
It's her anniversary.

259
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:39,245
Oh, Niles, don't be preposterous.

260
00:18:39,245 --> 00:18:43,253
I mean you've been working here forever,
and I haven't the faintest idea when you started.

261
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:48,591
You don't go off all halfcocked.
/ I keep the hurt inside, sir.

262
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:55,557
You also forget my birthday.
I suppose that's all right too.

263
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:58,388
Come on, Niles.

264
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:02,589
Are you seriously telling me that Miss Fine
is the type of person to hold it over my head

265
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:05,424
just because I...

266
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:08,574
oh, God, is it too late
to send flowers?

267
00:19:08,574 --> 00:19:12,649
Maxwell, have you lost your mind?
She is the nanny.

268
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:17,901
I have been your partner for ten years,
and we've never celebrated a damn thing.

269
00:19:18,297 --> 00:19:19,838
Get it?

270
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:26,815
Perhaps I can still pick something
up at Bloomingdales.

271
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:28,790
Maxwell, we have to get to the airport.

272
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:33,519
You are not going to miss this ceremony.
I can't walk down the aisle alone.

273
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:36,776
I say prepare for the inevitable.

274
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:50,641
Kids, hurry up.
Your father's on, and he won...

275
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,982
I hope his fly is open.

276
00:19:54,143 --> 00:19:59,241
Oh, doesn't daddy look handsome?
/ Uh-huh.  No Pierce Brosnan.

277
00:19:59,844 --> 00:20:05,717
Oh, there's Cee Cee.
/ Oh, my, the camera does put on ten pounds.

278
00:20:06,742 --> 00:20:10,173
It just doesn't distribute it.

279
00:20:11,856 --> 00:20:17,677
I'd like to thank the Center for
the Performing Arts for this most
gracious recognition,

280
00:20:17,677 --> 00:20:20,688
and I'd like to thank
my three wonderful children,

281
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:23,540
and a very special
thanks to the woman

282
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,147
without whose help
I wouldn't be here tonight...

283
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:29,680
Miss Fran Fine.

284
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,104
Oh ...

285
00:20:32,223 --> 00:20:35,241
Happy anniversary, Miss Fine.

286
00:20:37,387 --> 00:20:40,853
Cee Cee fainted.
/ Oh, my God.

287
00:20:41,303 --> 00:20:47,151
And that, ladies, is why you must
always wear your underwear.

288
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,119
Oh, congratulations, sir.
/ Thank you.

289
00:20:54,119 --> 00:21:00,497
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, that was so sweet
of you to mention my anniversary.

290
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:02,581
But, you know, you really
didn't have to.

291
00:21:02,581 --> 00:21:06,673
I mean those things
aren't important to me.

292
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:09,237
Well, they are important to me.

293
00:21:09,237 --> 00:21:11,311
It's been a marvelous year,
Miss Fine,

294
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,519
and you are a wonderful nanny,
and I'm sorry if I don't say it enough.

295
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:19,701
Oh, well, if I'm so wonderful,
how come nobody wants to hire me away?

296
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:21,316
Oh, well, that? / Yeah.

297
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:26,035
Well, there's a very simple
explanation to that.

298
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:29,098
As a matter of fact,
it's so simple

299
00:21:29,098 --> 00:21:33,336
that explaining it to you would
really be rather insulting.

300
00:21:33,862 --> 00:21:36,136
Go ahead.

301
00:21:36,951 --> 00:21:45,684
Um, well, the reason that you haven't had
any other job offers is simply because, ah ...

302
00:21:46,574 --> 00:21:49,102
Niles, is there any more tea?

303
00:21:49,102 --> 00:21:52,200
I'll go to China and see.

304
00:21:57,545 --> 00:21:58,645
Hi.

305
00:22:01,076 --> 00:22:04,206
Well, just look at you, Miss Fine.

306
00:22:04,206 --> 00:22:09,379
I mean, I mean I am a single father,
but what married woman in her right mind

307
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:14,426
would want someone as attractive as you
in her home right under her husband's nose?

308
00:22:16,963 --> 00:22:21,331
Oh, well, now, now that you mention it.

309
00:22:22,046 --> 00:22:25,325
Well, when you're right,
you're right.

310
00:22:25,508 --> 00:22:29,390
Good night, Mr. Sheffield ... Niles.
/ Good night, Miss Fine.

311
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,283
Nice, save, sir.
/ I came up with that at the last minute.

312
00:22:34,464 --> 00:22:37,467
I heard that ...

313
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:58,251
Brighten!
