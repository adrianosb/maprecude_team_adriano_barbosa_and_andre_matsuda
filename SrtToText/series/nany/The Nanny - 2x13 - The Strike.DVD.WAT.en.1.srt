1
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:05,681
Morning, Niles.

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,880
God save the queen.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,608
I don't look too much
 like a roll of Lifesavers?

4
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:17,404
Yes.  But the flavor
 goes on and on.

5
00:00:17,963 --> 00:00:21,921
Oh, Niles, it's always 
the quiet ones.

6
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:25,245
I want to wear this to
 Mr. Sheffield's big opening night,

7
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:28,297
but I gotta practice
 sitting in it.

8
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:30,835
Whoa!

9
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:34,788
That looks natural.

10
00:00:35,444 --> 00:00:38,376
Well, maybe if I sat on the aisle?

11
00:00:38,376 --> 00:00:41,152
Oh, oh, thanks.

12
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:44,802
Well, here it is a full-page 
ad in today's paper.

13
00:00:44,802 --> 00:00:46,697
"Opening tonight 'Norma,'

14
00:00:46,697 --> 00:00:50,409
a musical adaptation of Norma Rae,
 produced by Maxwell Sheffield

15
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:55,273
and Cee Cee Boopcock?" 
/ Boopcock?

16
00:00:55,273 --> 00:01:02,126
I proofread this ad copy myself, and then
 I gave it to Niles to send to the messenger  ...

17
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,445
Oh, how embarrassing.

18
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:09,592
Someone at that ad agency 
must have it in for you.

19
00:01:10,714 --> 00:01:13,777
Oh, who would have thought
 that I would love a musical

20
00:01:13,777 --> 00:01:17,256
about a union organizer sorely 
in need of dress shields,

21
00:01:17,256 --> 00:01:22,358
but I'll tell you, I'm still humming
 the sweat shop number.

22
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,818
Uh-huh.  So Niles, you haven't told me
 what you thought of the preview.

23
00:01:26,818 --> 00:01:28,563
Oh, it was wonderful, sir.

24
00:01:28,563 --> 00:01:33,156
Those three hours and fifteen minutes
 flew by like three hours and ten.

25
00:01:33,156 --> 00:01:36,767
And what a novel idea not 
to have an intermission.

26
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,589
Yes, thank you.  I'm, 
I'm very proud of the show.

27
00:01:40,589 --> 00:01:44,712
Well, you should be.  I know my whole
 family is going to see it.

28
00:01:44,712 --> 00:01:49,525
We're union workers from way back. 
 My Aunt Tessie was all-blouse.

29
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:52,714
What's all-blouse? 
/ You know, from the commercial.

30
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:56,061
"Look for the union label

31
00:01:56,061 --> 00:02:00,949
when you are buying a coat,
 dress, or blouse."

32
00:02:01,513 --> 00:02:04,571
Yes, well, let's all break
 a leg tonight, shall we?

33
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:07,397
Oh, you won't need luck, 
Mr. Sheffield,

34
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:11,589
not with the hit play you've got
 on your hands, Mister.

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,301
Niles, I'm not kissing up.  
It's a very important play.

36
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:23,273
If I don't sit through it again,
 how am I going to get to the party?

37
00:02:23,273 --> 00:02:25,629
Come on.  Don't you want to hobnob 
with some celebrities?

38
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:31,283
Miss Fine, I've been to scores of these
 and as yet, no one has hobbed my nobs.

39
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:37,063
Well, maybe you should try wearing
 something a little more low cut.

40
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:27,418
Fran, what do you think
 about this one?

41
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:34,036
Oh, honey, that is entirely
 too revealing.

42
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,880
No, no, no.  It makes
 you look cheap and taudry.

43
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,016
Go put it back in my closet.

44
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,852
Fran, Brighten says he can see up
 my dress when I wear my Mary Janes.

45
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:48,676
Oh, sweetie, don't listen to him.

46
00:03:48,676 --> 00:03:51,339
They make you look 
very lucky.

47
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:55,118
Oh, I see you're wearing the
 new Barbie underpants I bought you.

48
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,639
Say, Fran, can I go to that new mall in Jersey
 with with Kyle and a couple of guys?

49
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,829
Which Kyle?  The one with the braces 
or the one that smells like cheese?

50
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,480
Cheese.
 / Oh,good.  The other one's weird.

51
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:13,032
How you going to get there?
 / His brother's driving.

52
00:04:13,032 --> 00:04:15,860
How long has he had his license? 
/ A while.

53
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:21,363
A while ten years or a while he still
 looks like the picture on his license?

54
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:24,851
Oh, "B," I don't think so. 
 I don't want you getting into a car

55
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:30,357
with a bunch of boys that just drive fast
 and act fresh, and then the next thing you know,

56
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:36,232
you're hitchhiking on the Jersey turnpike
 wearing much too much makeup for your age -- oh.

57
00:04:40,707 --> 00:04:43,844
I'm having a hypoglycemic attack.

58
00:04:43,844 --> 00:04:46,501
I better have a Godiva.

59
00:04:47,676 --> 00:04:51,532
Oh, cheer up, honey. 
 Hey, I've been to that mall.

60
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:55,284
They don't even have
 a Judy's there.

61
00:04:55,284 --> 00:04:57,982
Besides, tonight's your father's
 big opening night.

62
00:04:57,982 --> 00:05:01,433
What if you got stuck in traffic?  
Then you'd miss the whole thing.

63
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:04,145
I'm not that lucky.

64
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:08,749
Hum, nugget.

65
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:18,812
Say, Dad, could I go to
 the mall with Kyle?

66
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:22,245
Well, I don't know. 
 What does Miss Fine say?

67
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:25,229
Well, you see, she was kind of
 leaning towards no.

68
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:28,681
But between you and me, I think
 she's just a little overprotective,

69
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:32,998
which is fine for the girls,
 but sometimes a man needs to get away.

70
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:34,544
Maxwell ...

71
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:36,870
I know what you mean.

72
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,670
Well, all right. 
 Off you go, huh.  Have fun.

73
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:43,658
Yes...

74
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:52,439
terday, all my troubles 
seemed so far away.

75
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:56,709
Now it looks as though
 they're here to stay.

76
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:03,293
Well, the good news is "B,"
 I'm usually a very fair nanny.

77
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:08,049
The bad news is it's
 the 28th day of the month.

78
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:14,988
Niles, how long are you going to
 polish that couch?

79
00:06:14,988 --> 00:06:17,927
The fumes are rather overwhelming.

80
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:21,856
After a while, 
you don't notice them, sir.

81
00:06:24,472 --> 00:06:27,842
Oh, I couldn't resist 
the infomercial.

82
00:06:27,842 --> 00:06:31,642
"Unwanted dirt just
 slides right off ..."

83
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,168
Voila!

84
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:49,038
Cheers.  Must be five
 o'clock somewhere.

85
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:51,129
I haven't been drinking,
 Nanny Fine.

86
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:55,237
I just slid off the couch.

87
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:59,757
And Ted Kennedy's nose 
is just sun damaged.

88
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:02,575
Mr. Sheffield, you got a second? 
/ Yes.

89
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:06,472
Well, Brighten -- / Whoops! 
 Time's up.  Good-bye, Nanny Fine.

90
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:09,958
Well, you're in a good mood. 
 Well, I'll take care of that.

91
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:15,370
Well, this sounds like a must miss.  
I have to pick up my dress from the cleaners anyway.

92
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,716
Ohhhh!

93
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:23,089
It's also an excellent
 floor polish.

94
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:27,423
All right, Miss Fine, 
now what's all this about Brighten?

95
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:29,395
Well, we've got a little problem.

96
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:31,522
Brighten knew I didn't want
 him to go to the mall.

97
00:07:31,522 --> 00:07:34,208
So he used you to undermine me.

98
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:39,472
No.  In all fairness, he made it 
perfectly clear you'd already said no.

99
00:07:39,632 --> 00:07:42,073
Oh, well, then I take it back.

100
00:07:42,073 --> 00:07:45,680
We don't have a little problem. 
 We've got a big problem.

101
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,634
Miss Fine, don't you think you're
 being just a bit overprotective?

102
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:53,622
It's a, it's a guy thing.

103
00:07:53,622 --> 00:07:57,407
You know, I, I thought it was 
appropriate to just let him go.

104
00:07:57,407 --> 00:08:00,587
And just how did you think 
he was getting to Jersey?

105
00:08:00,587 --> 00:08:03,190
He's going to Jersey?

106
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,020
Just for the future, 
Mr. Sheffield,

107
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,137
when the kids 
say "Fran said, 'No,'

108
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:12,964
" that's the big robot saying
 danger Will Robinson."

109
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:18,581
You know, I could have 
stayed in England.

110
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:24,205
I'll make it simple for you.  
Children are like a brassiere.

111
00:08:25,217 --> 00:08:28,393
One part of me says
 get out the window quick.

112
00:08:28,393 --> 00:08:32,679
But the other part just 
has to know why.

113
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:37,798
Because they divide and separate.

114
00:08:39,293 --> 00:08:42,567
Ahhh .../ Your mother
 never told you that?

115
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:46,812
No.  But we always thought mummy should 
have talked more about her underwear.

116
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,729
My point is that you have to give me 
full support. You must back me up no matter what.

117
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:57,878
All right, Miss Fine, I promise,
 if you promise no brassiere analogies.

118
00:08:57,878 --> 00:09:00,824
Cross my heart.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.

119
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:07,082
I don't want to hear that you 
don't want to go tonight.

120
00:09:07,082 --> 00:09:10,686
That man works very hard to put
 a roof over your head.

121
00:09:10,686 --> 00:09:14,113
Now stop whining and go put 
on your party clothes.

122
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:16,604
Oh, all right.

123
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:20,031
Don't give me that look.
 / What look?

124
00:09:20,031 --> 00:09:25,200
Oh, the look of anticipation, sir. 
It's only four hours till "Norma."

125
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:28,308
Try to hold on, man.

126
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,637
Do you smell cheese?

127
00:09:34,637 --> 00:09:36,609
Oh, that's Kyle.

128
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,417
All righty.  I'm going to
 the mall like you said.

129
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:42,857
I've changed my mind.  
Brighten you're staying home.

130
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:47,107
... and when Miss Fine says 
"No," it means no.

131
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:51,572
Good afternoon, monster -- 
ah, Master Kyle.

132
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:58,242
Dad, nothing's going to happen. 
/ Look, I think I've made
 myself perfectly clear.

133
00:09:58,242 --> 00:10:01,467
Is someone making grilled cheese?

134
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:06,006
I think Kyle's just 
a little overheated.

135
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:08,972
Take your coat off, honey.

136
00:10:08,972 --> 00:10:12,836
Hello, I'm Peter Bidwall.  I'll be 
driving the boys to the mall.

137
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:14,949
You must be Mr. Sheffield.
 / Yes.

138
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:19,492
How do you do, sir? I saw 
your last play.  Brilliant.

139
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:22,406
Really?  What was your favorite part?

140
00:10:22,406 --> 00:10:26,594
Mr. Sheffield .../ Now, Miss Fine,
 he seems like a perfectly responsible young man.

141
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:29,136
Yeah.  Too bad that he's not
 the one that's driving. / What?

142
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:32,690
I'll bet you dollars for donuts 
that this kid is the decoy.

143
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,390
We used to send Bridgett O'Malley 
in her parochial uniform to the door.

144
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,164
Meanwhile, behind the wheel 
is sitting Debbie Cutler

145
00:10:39,164 --> 00:10:42,605
burning her boyfriend's
 initials in her forearm.

146
00:10:42,605 --> 00:10:44,742
Watch and learn.

147
00:10:44,742 --> 00:10:46,313
Lovely home you have here.

148
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:50,077
Peter, I've never met you before.
 Where do you go go school?

149
00:10:50,077 --> 00:10:54,295
Um, right around the corner.
 / Oh ...  Who are you studying with?

150
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:57,007
Hamagher or Schlemmer?

151
00:10:57,007 --> 00:11:01,937
Ah, Schlemmer?

152
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:06,090
Okay. Where'd they dig you up from?

153
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,150
The Gap.

154
00:11:12,413 --> 00:11:15,500
How much are they paying you? 
/ Twenty.

155
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,855
Twenty?  Boy, Bridgett used to do
 it for a pack of Kents.

156
00:11:20,855 --> 00:11:24,100
Well, you're busted, you guys.

157
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,552
Sorry, guys.  No refunds.

158
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:32,273
Kyle, you paid him?

159
00:11:32,273 --> 00:11:37,150
Well, if he's not driving, 
then I'm not going. Get out.

160
00:11:39,343 --> 00:11:42,545
Oh, man, that was close.

161
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:45,104
Brighten --
/ Allow, me, Miss Fine.

162
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:48,104
Brighten, you are grounded.
 / Ha ...

163
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:51,619
And furthermore, you're not
 going to the show tonight.

164
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:53,250
Ohhh,

165
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:58,435
but I've only seen that once.

166
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:02,743
You should have thought of
 that before.

167
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:07,744
Oh, well.

168
00:12:07,744 --> 00:12:09,666
Freeze!

169
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:13,012
Mr. Sheffield,

170
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,732
I think you're being just
 a little too severe.

171
00:12:16,732 --> 00:12:20,389
He's really a good boy.

172
00:12:21,722 --> 00:12:24,429
No, I'm not.

173
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:28,001
I'm bad, very bad.

174
00:12:28,184 --> 00:12:33,444
He wants to come with us
 and see the play again.

175
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,443
All three acts.

176
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:41,817
Well ... 
/ Oh, but I don't deserve it.

177
00:12:41,817 --> 00:12:46,008
Oh, baby, you do.

178
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,956
You really do.

179
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,504
Mr. Sheffield?  Another opening, 
another shrimp joke.

180
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:05,047
Miss Fine, what were those two women 
behind you complaining about?

181
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:09,148
Oh, who knows?  Something 
about not being able to see.

182
00:13:09,668 --> 00:13:11,942
What do you think, Niles?  Niles?

183
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:14,455
The Nicks are up by two.

184
00:13:14,455 --> 00:13:17,505
Maxwell, the photographers want to
 take a picture of us. / Oh ...

185
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,466
Go on, Nanny Fine, free shrimp.

186
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,515
You don't have to tell me twice

187
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:27,502
Mr. Sheffield, can we get
 a photo of you and Miss Boopcock?

188
00:13:27,746 --> 00:13:30,291
All right. 
 Not shall we?

189
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:37,623
Wait a minute. 
 Are the busboys on strike?

190
00:13:37,623 --> 00:13:41,206
Oh, my God, those poor people.

191
00:13:41,206 --> 00:13:44,380
Who's going to clear their tables?

192
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:47,442
Miss Fine, after you.

193
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:51,419
Mr. Sheffield, I can't go in there.  
My mother had three rules:

194
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:55,276
Never make contact with a public toilet;

195
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:58,316
never ever ever cross
 a picket line.

196
00:13:58,316 --> 00:14:02,990
What was the third one?  Oh, yeah. 
 Never wear Musk oil to zoo.

197
00:14:03,163 --> 00:14:05,410
Miss Fine, you're embarrassing me.
  Now come along.

198
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,483
I can't.  My my Aunt All-Blouse
 would roll over in her grave,

199
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:12,514
which was paid for by her union.

200
00:14:12,514 --> 00:14:16,219
Now, will you please come in before
 this turns into a spectacle? / No, no ....

201
00:14:16,219 --> 00:14:21,580
No, I can't ...  Stop it. 
/ Would you let go, Miss Fine.
  Would you please listen.

202
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:34,940
Oh, Niles, boy did I ruin
 Mr. Sheffield's big night last night.

203
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,508
Well, you know what I'll do just
 to defuse the situation?

204
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:44,736
I'll tell him how adorable he is,
 compliment him on his accent.

205
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,823
And if that fails, I can always
 turn on the tears.

206
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:52,079
He's a real sucker for crying.

207
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:55,930
Oh, hi, Niles / Hello.

208
00:15:00,186 --> 00:15:03,316
Can you drop me off
 at Unemployment?

209
00:15:03,616 --> 00:15:06,550
Good morning, Miss Fine. 
 Entertainment section, please, Niles.

210
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,829
Oh, don't bother. 
 I've already scoured the paper.

211
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:12,292
I didn't see any mention of
 our little incident.

212
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:17,499
It was a coupon?

213
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,819
Just imagine what this picture 
would have look liked, huh?

214
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:23,270
Miss Fine!

215
00:15:23,807 --> 00:15:25,727
How could you do it to me?

216
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:29,303
Well, I'm sorry.  But the Fines 
don't cross picket lines.

217
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,235
It's against our religion.  
Like eating pork.

218
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:34,972
Well, you eat bacon. 
/ No, I don't.

219
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:36,640
You most certainly do too.

220
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,004
All right.  But only if it's very
 crispy or in a club sandwich.

221
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:44,287
But don't ever tell my grandmother. 
/ She eats it as well.

222
00:15:44,287 --> 00:15:47,998
Oh, all right, we all do.

223
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:53,571
Mr. Sheffield, what part of England
 do you come from?

224
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:56,605
You have such a gorgeous accent.

225
00:15:56,605 --> 00:15:58,510
Miss Fine ...

226
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:02,414
Well, you don't understand anything.

227
00:16:02,414 --> 00:16:07,028
Oh, I understand a lot
 more than you think.

228
00:16:08,045 --> 00:16:12,276
Oh, what's the use?  You blue bloods
 just don't know from us blue collars.

229
00:16:12,276 --> 00:16:16,271
Oh, so now I don't appreciate 
the plight of the working man, huh?

230
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:18,262
Look, I have a job.
 / Huh?

231
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:21,310
I'm a working stiff,
 just like the next guy.

232
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,631
Oh, Niles, what is this on my shoe?

233
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,779
Daddy, I need the limo.  I have
 a riding lesson after school.

234
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,497
But I have a play date
 with Ivanka Trunk.

235
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:36,366
Well, one of you will just have to
 take the Town Car, won't you?

236
00:16:37,656 --> 00:16:41,300
There.  See.  We have problems
 just like everyone else.

237
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,638
Maxwell, you are never going to
 believe what happened.

238
00:16:44,638 --> 00:16:47,610
There was a message on 
your answering machine?

239
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:51,814
No, no.  The box office does -- no ...

240
00:16:51,814 --> 00:16:56,343
The box office doesn't open for a hour, 
and there's already a line around the block,

241
00:16:56,343 --> 00:16:59,408
and Sally Jesse Rafael wants us
 on her show today.

242
00:16:59,408 --> 00:17:02,222
Oh, I love her.  She's the best.

243
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:07,630
You know, Oprah goes up and down, 
but Sally maintains her ideal weight.

244
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,874
Cee Cee, Sally isn't inviting us to
 chat up the show.

245
00:17:10,874 --> 00:17:13,746
She just wants us to talk up
 that bloody picket line incident.

246
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:18,330
Maxwell, Maxwell, Maxwell, she isn't
 going to be the only one with a mike.

247
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:23,067
I will just paint Nanny Fine 
as a disgruntled nut.

248
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:27,385
Disgruntled nut?  That could work.

249
00:17:27,385 --> 00:17:30,269
Well, maybe we should go.  I suppose
 I could try some damage control.

250
00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:34,080
Maxwell, leave it to me. 
 I can fix anything.

251
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:40,063
You can fix anything?  Cee Cee, there is 
a billboard in Town Square that says "Boopcock."

252
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,190
Where's Steadman?

253
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,240
That's "Oprah."  This is "Sally." 
/ Oh.

254
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,028
Five, four, three, two  ...

255
00:17:54,055 --> 00:17:57,374
Well, today we have 
the producers of "Norma,"

256
00:17:57,374 --> 00:18:02,594
which opened on Broadway yesterday
 to rave reviews, I might add.

257
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:07,095
So I told you you were worried
 about nothing.

258
00:18:07,095 --> 00:18:13,156
Max, isn't it ironic that you are producing
 a play that is pro-union

259
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:21,082
and yet you were photographed dragging an employee 
across the picket line? / I know.  I know.

260
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:26,399
Oh, would you look at 
the size of that picture.

261
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:30,609
I wonder how much it would 
cost to get that framed.

262
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,274
Well, Sally, first of all, I,
 I want to go on record

263
00:18:34,274 --> 00:18:40,550
as saying that "Norma" employs nearly 
300 union members. / Oh, oh, oh ...

264
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:46,104
Nanny Fine is a disgruntled nut.

265
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:49,531
Oh, look, my name's on TV.

266
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,626
Well, look at who we have here.

267
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:56,888
Fran Fine, the nanny. 
/ Hi, Sally.

268
00:18:56,888 --> 00:19:01,655
Why don't you join them on stage? 
/ Oh, no, I couldn't --

269
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:05,393
oh, well, for the people.

270
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:10,339
Why don't you move over,
 Miss Boopcock ...

271
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:18,371
Max, did you know that
 there was a strike?

272
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:20,242
Well, no, of course not, Sally.

273
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,518
But what was I supposed to do?  
Everyone was already inside.

274
00:19:23,518 --> 00:19:26,443
I mean, cast members, 
celebrities, the press.

275
00:19:26,443 --> 00:19:30,856
I called Beef Steak Charlies. 
 They don't have a booth for 312.

276
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:35,143
Wow!  That's a lot of important people. 
 What did you expect him to do, Fran?

277
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:37,489
Fran?  Fran?

278
00:19:38,995 --> 00:19:45,867
Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, you know, 
I understood why he crossed the picket line.

279
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:48,448
Why can't he understand
 why I couldn't?

280
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:51,264
I, I thought we were supposed to back
 each other up no matter what?

281
00:19:51,264 --> 00:19:54,164
Oh, so I'm just supposed to play
 along with everything you say?

282
00:19:54,164 --> 00:19:57,223
Well, apparently I'm supposed to play 
along with everything you say./ Now --

283
00:19:57,223 --> 00:20:02,377
Hold it folks. / What -- Max, what are we
 really talking about here?  I mean in one word.

284
00:20:02,377 --> 00:20:06,662
Support. / Good.  Fran, in one word.

285
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:11,217
One word?  Good bloody luck.

286
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:21,248
Hey, mister they had to turn the music 
on to get you off the stage at the Tony Awards ...

287
00:20:24,081 --> 00:20:29,558
Kids, Maxwell, will you at least concede
 that perhaps you could have been a little bit

288
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:33,326
more sympathetic to Fran's feelings 
on the picket line?

289
00:20:33,326 --> 00:20:38,778
Well, I suppose I ...
 maybe ... might?

290
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:51,280
I missed that, Sally.  You're going
 to have to send me a transcript.

291
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,780
Well, look,
 it was a very important night for me.

292
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,645
You're important to me. 
 Ergo, I wanted you there.

293
00:20:56,645 --> 00:20:59,930
Ergo?  Who's ergo.

294
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:04,645
Sally, Sally ...  
Look, look, girl friend,

295
00:21:05,376 --> 00:21:10,235
didn't you hear what the man just said? 
 He said you're important to him.

296
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:15,230
Is that what you said? 
/ Yes.

297
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,491
Well, why can't they just communicate?

298
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:26,038
You know, if we were running the world, 
there'd be no wars; right, girls?

299
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:31,225
Right, right. Right.  Because,

300
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:38,626
because there'd be so much bloody talk, 
there'd be no time for the war; 
 isn't that true, gentleman?

301
00:21:39,702 --> 00:21:43,191
Whoof!  Whoof!  Whoof!
  Whoof!  Whoof!  Whoof!

302
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:47,495
Boy, that Sally is
 one fantastic interviewer.

303
00:21:47,495 --> 00:21:50,839
She gets things out of you that 
you didn't even know were there.

304
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:55,976
That tax shelter where you hid all that money,
 I don't know how that came out.

305
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:59,687
Well, well, it wasn't
 a total disaster.

306
00:21:59,687 --> 00:22:03,169
It seems our appearance shamed the hotel
 into settling with the busboys.

307
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:07,699
Oh, that makes me feel good because, 
you know, they work so hard,

308
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:11,594
and all they really needed was to be
 treated with a little human dignity.

309
00:22:11,594 --> 00:22:14,899
I thought you'd like that.
  They settled for $8.00 an hour.

310
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:19,017
What?  For bringing water that
 you have to ask 16 times for,

311
00:22:19,017 --> 00:22:21,909
and then they take your plate 
before you're through.

312
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:25,802
Well, then, you know they're
 eating it in the back.

313
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:29,990
Oh, Niles, we are going to have 
to get organized.  We're being exploited.

314
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:34,645
Amen!  Would you like some fois gras? 
/ Nah.  I've had it up to here with Beluga.

315
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:38,002
Yes, life is tough, isn't it, folks?

316
00:22:38,002 --> 00:22:41,092
He should only walk a mile in my shoes.

317
00:22:41,092 --> 00:22:44,894
Oh, Miss Fine, you can't walk
 a mile in your shoes. / Aha!

318
00:22:46,057 --> 00:22:53,445
Humm, humm, humm, humm, humm, humm 
... a blouse ...

319
00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:56,935
humm, humm, humm, humm, humm, 
humm, humm, humm, humm.

320
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:02,161
Oh, Sally is very classy.

321
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:07,659
The way she handled those
 bisexual Siamese twins ...

322
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:11,395
I'll tell you, Geraldo really 
sensationalized it,

323
00:23:11,395 --> 00:23:15,586
but Sally handled it with a plumb.

324
00:23:15,586 --> 00:23:18,510
That's aplomb, Miss Fine.

325
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,530
No, it was a plumb.

326
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:25,497
What the devil does bisexual Siamese
 twins have to do with the plumb?

327
00:23:25,497 --> 00:23:28,173
It was pretty amazing.
