1
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,348
I am so sick of
 all this snow.

2
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:14,723
There's a pigeon frozen
 to the windowsill.

3
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:19,398
Oh gee, look at this gorgeous 
tanned family relaxing on the bench.

4
00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:24,053
Oh, who is that attractive
 brunette in the background there?

5
00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:27,231
Oh gee, you know,
 that must be the nanny.

6
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:31,212
No.  No, it couldn't be. 
 Her mouth's closed.

7
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:35,385
You know, actually, this does 
look very inviting. / Hm-hmm.

8
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:37,793
Yeah, I suppose we could 
all do with a break.

9
00:00:37,793 --> 00:00:39,779
Hey, let's go to
 the Caiman Club.

10
00:00:39,779 --> 00:00:42,800
Oh yeah, they've got that
 fabulous teen program.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,596
Oh, too bad you're only twelve.

12
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:50,059
Oh, yeah.  But you could be unpopular
 with a whole new bunch of kids.

13
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:53,535
Best of all, they have a whole
 separate dining room for children.

14
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:57,106
I don't care.  As long as
 I get some color.

15
00:00:57,106 --> 00:01:00,871
Wait a minute.  Kids' program,
 separate dining rooms.
 What kind of place is this?

16
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:04,180
It sounds like you guys would
 never see each other. / Well, yeah.

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,479
That's kind of the point.
 / It's a vacation.

18
00:01:07,854 --> 00:01:10,973
A family vacation you spend 
with your family.

19
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:13,332
We spend every summer 
together in Miami.

20
00:01:13,332 --> 00:01:18,728
Oh, how could you go to Miami in the summer? 
/ Easy.  Drive south and hang a left at hell.

21
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:22,566
Oh, wasn't it hot and
 humid and gross?

22
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:26,032
Yeah, but it was off season rates, 
so we got to stay twice as long.

23
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:30,244
Plus the Fountainbleau had this
 fabulous seafood extravaganza.

24
00:01:30,244 --> 00:01:35,399
Oh, buffet tip: Always go past 
the rolls, right to the lobster and shrimp.

25
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:38,393
Did you write that down, Niles? 
/ It's all up here, sir.

26
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:41,411
Oh, you guys'll have 
such a great time,

27
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:44,182
and you'll come back with
 a whole new lease on life.

28
00:01:44,182 --> 00:01:46,605
Of course, I'll still be here
 saddled with the old lease...

29
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:48,370
Miss Fine. 
/ ...shoveling snow on the walkway.

30
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,209
Miss Fine. / Probably fall, break my hip. 
 Aw, you'll pick me up when you get back.

31
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:52,732
Miss Fine!
 / What?!

32
00:01:52,732 --> 00:01:56,548
If I'm traveling with the children, 
naturally I expect the nanny to accompany us.

33
00:01:56,548 --> 00:02:01,211
Oh, how kind of you 
to think of me.

34
00:02:01,765 --> 00:02:04,877
What about Niles though?  
Don't you want a little peace and quiet?

35
00:02:04,877 --> 00:02:08,792
Desperately.
  How soon can you all pack?

36
00:03:03,656 --> 00:03:08,603
A vacation?  That's a splendid idea.
  I've been dying to get away.

37
00:03:08,603 --> 00:03:11,848
Well, now's your chance, 
since I'll be out of town. / Oh.

38
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:16,175
I hear Club Med has a desperate
 women with no prospects package.

39
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:21,323
It's a waste of money. 
 So I've heard.

40
00:03:21,323 --> 00:03:23,833
Oh, C.C., you know we'd like
 to take you with us,

41
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,567
but this is really a time for me
 to be alone with the family.

42
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:29,517
Yoo-hoo, Mister Sheffield.

43
00:03:29,763 --> 00:03:33,603
Oh, wait till you see
 the adorable bathing suit

44
00:03:33,603 --> 00:03:37,731
I got for the honeymoon... 
I mean, the vacation.

45
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,839
Oh, Grace would look
 very cute in that.

46
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:45,064
What Grace?  
This is for me.

47
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:49,399
If we're going to Gilligan's Island,
 I wanna be Ginger.

48
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:54,185
You mean you're going with him? 
/ A nanny's work is never done.

49
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:58,574
Well, if you'll all excuse me, 
I have a life to get on with.

50
00:03:58,574 --> 00:04:01,392
I have a standing invitation
 with a certain senator.

51
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:05,133
Hmm... What some politicians
 won't do for a vote.

52
00:04:11,607 --> 00:04:14,272
Oh-wee, oh-wee baby...

53
00:04:14,272 --> 00:04:17,298
Won't you let me take you
 on a sea cruise.

54
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,407
They don't write
 'em like that anymore.

55
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:23,860
I can't wait to go snorkeling. 
/ Oh, me, too.

56
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,199
Maggie floating face down
 in the water; I'm there.

57
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,996
Niles, you didn't have to drive us 
to the airport. / Oh, yes I did, sir.

58
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:35,726
If need be, 
I would have carried you.

59
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:39,052
Oh, I can't stand driving backwards.
  I get car stick.

60
00:04:39,052 --> 00:04:43,187
Uh, Miss Babcock, would
 you mind switching with me?

61
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:49,202
Is it absolutely necessary? 
/ Did you see the pea soup scene in the Exorcist?

62
00:04:49,202 --> 00:04:51,800
All right, all right. 
/ Okay, thank you.

63
00:04:52,587 --> 00:04:55,679
Oh... Yeah, oh good.

64
00:04:57,558 --> 00:05:01,849
Oh, whoops, whoops, you got a run 
in your stocking.  Oh no, 
it's just a spider vein.

65
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:06,629
Oh, these lifeguards are gorgeous.

66
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:08,721
I can't wait to drown.

67
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:12,329
Not that we're ever gonna get 
there with this traffic.
 / Oh, I know a shortcut.

68
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:15,391
No.  No, no.  We'll stay on the expressway.
  It's the most direct route.

69
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,737
Yeah, that's what my father said
 when we were on our way to see
 Liza at the Westbury Music Fair.

70
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:24,637
P.S., we got there so late she was 
halfway through her encore of New York.

71
00:05:24,637 --> 00:05:26,976
Don't you mean New York, New York?

72
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:29,691
That's how late we were.

73
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:34,795
Miss Fine, we've passed
 that same derelict six times.

74
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:40,193
Are we there yet? / I told you
 to go before we left the house.

75
00:05:40,193 --> 00:05:42,954
I didn't have to go then.

76
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:45,480
Whatever you do, don't think
 about rushing rivers,

77
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,048
or babbling brooks, or waterfalls.

78
00:05:50,506 --> 00:05:54,139
I'm singing in the rain...

79
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:57,382
Is that a gas station? 
/ No.

80
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:02,980
Hey, where's Ronnie's Slack Shack? 
/ Who cares?

81
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,781
Well, I'm losing all my landmarks. 
 Everything is white from the snow.

82
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:12,317
Oh, I know what we'll do.  I know. 
 We'll go to my mother's. 
From there I can find my way anywhere.

83
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:14,891
Well, well, well, couldn't you 
just pretend we, you've just 
left your mother's

84
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:17,696
and are picking me up here 
on the way to the airport.

85
00:06:17,696 --> 00:06:21,058
Forget it.  If you're taking me away
 for the weekend, the least 
you could do is pick me up.

86
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:24,297
What kind of a girl do 
you think I am?

87
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:32,458
What are you doing here? 
/ Where's your bathroom?

88
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,836
Oh, down the hall.  But don't use 
the rosette soaps.  They're just for show.

89
00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:38,847
The Glad is under the sink.

90
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,218
Your father was just in there.
 / Oh...

91
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:44,884
Uh, I have to go, too. 
 Where's your other bathroom?

92
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:46,473
Oh, it's in
 the luncheonette on the corner.

93
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:50,625
But they make you order something.
  I recommend the grilled cheese.

94
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:53,886
I am so sorry for this
 intrusion, Mrs. Fine.

95
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:57,557
Oh, not at all.  It's an honor
 to have you in our house.

96
00:06:57,557 --> 00:07:00,043
You couldn't call, tell a person
 that you're coming?

97
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:03,312
I would have windexed the couch. 
/ Ma...

98
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:05,636
Oh, Mrs. Fine, please,
 don't go to any trouble.

99
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:09,001
We're only gonna be here for a minute. 
 We're on our way to the airport. / Yeah.

100
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:11,068
You mean you haven't heard? 
/ What?

101
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:16,425
Heard what? / I just saw it on T.V. 
 It's the worst blizzard in thirty years.

102
00:07:16,425 --> 00:07:18,491
Oh, it doesn't look that bad.

103
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:22,555
Oh God, did Kathy Lee come
 into the studio? / No.

104
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:25,455
Oh, it's bad.

105
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:28,410
All the airports and
 the bridges are closed.

106
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,265
What?  Are you telling me
 we're actually stuck here?

107
00:07:31,265 --> 00:07:34,676
What about our vacation? 
/ The Caribbean.  Ehh.

108
00:07:34,676 --> 00:07:38,718
You never know when there's 
a revolution, a coop.

109
00:07:38,718 --> 00:07:42,415
You'll stay here where 
you're nice and safe.

110
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:45,734
So, are you hungry?  
I could make a rump roast.

111
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:50,897
I got a tongue in the freezer. 
/ What did she say?

112
00:07:51,131 --> 00:07:54,813
Well, I am feeling all refreshed
 and rearing to go.

113
00:07:54,813 --> 00:07:58,610
Who's gonna tell her? 
/ Oh please, allow me.

114
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:05,211
The bridges, airports, and weekends with
 a senator have been shut down due to the blizzard.

115
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:11,242
Good one, Niles.
  Let's go.

116
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:14,964
Oh, I get it,
 you're all in on it, huh?

117
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,845
Tell me he's joking!

118
00:08:19,657 --> 00:08:25,303
It won't be so bad. 
 Ma's gonna boil a tongue.

119
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:40,401
Wheel of Fortune!

120
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:47,528
What's Vanna wearing? 
/ A blue, short, sequined decorte.

121
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:50,484
Oh, that's a return.

122
00:08:50,873 --> 00:08:54,758
Have you ever had the opportunity
 of working with Merv Griffin?

123
00:08:54,758 --> 00:09:00,501
The man is brilliant.  You know,
 he still makes up the puzzles all by himself.

124
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:02,715
He's a giant in the industry.

125
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:07,321
Yeah, his weight does go up 
and down, God bless him.

126
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:16,229
Oh my goodness, Miss Fine, 
what are you wearing?

127
00:09:16,229 --> 00:09:21,537
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
 our vacation is starting right now.

128
00:09:21,537 --> 00:09:24,176
Then I want a refund.

129
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:27,828
Oh, there's always one
 in the tour group.

130
00:09:28,172 --> 00:09:32,055
Miss Babcock, you've hardly
 touched your tongue.

131
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:35,082
Actually, I'm on 
a no-tongue diet.

132
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:38,632
Oh, the senator will 
be so disappointed.

133
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:43,431
I think it's really good, 
Mrs. Fine.

134
00:09:44,427 --> 00:09:45,836
Mmm...

135
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:49,151
Say, I know what'll set the mood.

136
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:53,322
How about the Let's Get
 Acquainted cocktail party?

137
00:09:53,322 --> 00:09:55,992
********** 
/ Oh, yes... Please...

138
00:09:56,435 --> 00:09:58,526
Red or purple?

139
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:00,977
Don't you have anything drier?

140
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:04,715
Um, Bailey's Irish Cream? 
/ That's for dessert.

141
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:08,633
No, for dessert we're having 
Jello One-Two-Three.

142
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,948
Ma, I thought they stopped making
 that in the early seventies?

143
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:16,402
Well, I've been saving it for
 a special occasion.

144
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:21,158
If this doesn't knock me out,
 hit me with the bottle.

145
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:34,743
Hey, hey, hey, little one,
 what did I say?

146
00:10:34,743 --> 00:10:38,812
No swimming in the ocean for
 two hours after eating tongue.

147
00:10:39,588 --> 00:10:44,150
And you should put on some sun block.
  You don't wanna blotch, do you?

148
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,897
One down and Mah Jong.

149
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:53,200
This is terrifying.  Are you telling me
 this Gilligan chap never gets off the island?

150
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,597
He got off once, but then they 
went back with the Harlem Globetrotters.

151
00:10:58,836 --> 00:11:00,839
I think I'll go and watch
 the game with Morty.

152
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:06,219
Well, keep your eyeglasses on.  
He's clipping his toenails 
and those suckers can fly.

153
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:11,494
This is pathetic.  Right now 
I should be wind surfing into 
the sunset with this guy.

154
00:11:11,494 --> 00:11:15,431
His tan, buff arms around me.

155
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:19,834
In your dreams.  And even 
then I'll be watching you.

156
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:22,042
Don't feel so bad, Maggie...

157
00:11:22,913 --> 00:11:26,098
Excellent!  
Oh, that was so satisfying.

158
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:29,052
Brighton, you are so immature.

159
00:11:29,052 --> 00:11:32,144
Did you find the "who 
cut the cheese" pillow? / No!

160
00:11:33,905 --> 00:11:38,207
I'm in hell. 
/ Join the club.

161
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:43,281
That's the doorbell. 
/ Thanks, Ma.  We were all wondering.

162
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:48,664
Oh, that's okay, Niles.  I'll get it. 
/ Oh, sorry.  Force of habit.

163
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:53,593
Oh, look, it's the cute cabana boy.

164
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:56,954
Hi, Kenny.  What's up? 
 How's your parents?  What do you need?

165
00:11:56,954 --> 00:12:00,239
Not much.  They're fine.
  Fabric softener.

166
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,876
Oh, come on in.  
Boy, look how big you got.

167
00:12:03,876 --> 00:12:06,308
You really grew 
into your ears.

168
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,828
Well, I had that growth spurt 
after my bar mitzvah.

169
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:13,774
Hey, you wanna meet a real
 live shiksa goddess?

170
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:16,722
Kenny, this is Maggie.
  Maggie, Kenny.

171
00:12:16,722 --> 00:12:18,714
Hi. 
/ Hi.

172
00:12:18,714 --> 00:12:21,031
Mix and mingle.

173
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,639
We're stuck here. 
/ I've been stuck here for seventeen years.

174
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,117
At least you get to leave 
when the snow melts.

175
00:12:28,117 --> 00:12:31,326
Cool jeans. / Oh, thanks. 
 I got 'em at Ronnie's Slack Shack.

176
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:34,106
Where is that place?  
/ It's on Union Turnpike,

177
00:12:34,106 --> 00:12:36,652
right next door to 
Vinny's Jacket Racket.

178
00:12:36,652 --> 00:12:40,820
Oh, yeah,
 by the Blouse House.

179
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,931
Does anyone have a sharp knife?

180
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,978
Hey, you wanna come down
 to the new launderette?

181
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:50,327
If you think I'm cute now you should
 see me under the fluorescent lights.

182
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,824
Oh, aren't they cute?

183
00:12:53,824 --> 00:12:59,807
It's just like Blue Lagoon. 
 She's Brooke Shields and he's David Brenner.

184
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,228
He seemed like a nice young man.

185
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:05,505
If anyone wants my opinion... 
/ Hands?

186
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:07,588
Niles.
 / Sorry, sir.

187
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:12,343
But every time I try to get out, 
she pulls me back in.

188
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:15,292
Say what you will, 
buy this is an iffy neighborhood.

189
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:17,480
For all we know he could
 be a member of a gang.

190
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,286
What gang?  
The Oys in the Hood?

191
00:13:23,994 --> 00:13:26,851
I'm telling you, 
this kid is a doll.

192
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:30,828
His father invented the little plastic
 thingys on the ends of shoelaces.

193
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:33,586
Oh, of course, the lace thingy there.

194
00:13:33,586 --> 00:13:35,787
Where have you been hiding him?

195
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:38,976
Oh, stop, Mister Sheffield, no.
  It's your vacation.

196
00:13:38,976 --> 00:13:41,935
Oh, I know.  And I'm having such 
a lovely time here in the sitting room,

197
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:44,430
but I thought I'd take 
a little scenic tour of the kitchen.

198
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,957
Oh, while you're in there, 
will you pull out the capon for tomorrow?

199
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:52,671
And smear on some of
 the Campbell's Creamy Mushroom.

200
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:55,993
This is awfully nice of your parents
 to take us in like this.

201
00:13:55,993 --> 00:13:58,149
Oh, that's the kind of
 people they are.

202
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:00,969
I mean, you know, they consider
 you all family and

203
00:14:00,969 --> 00:14:04,213
when it comes to family, 
we Fines stick together.

204
00:14:04,213 --> 00:14:06,630
I'll tell you, there's more warmth
 in this little apartment,

205
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,730
than in all the Caribbean
 Islands put together.

206
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,918
Oh, well, what's this?

207
00:14:13,164 --> 00:14:15,188
A fortune chicken?

208
00:14:16,364 --> 00:14:21,401
Oh, is that not romantic.
  My father left my mother a love letter

209
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:25,795
and stuffed it in the chicken between
 the heart and the giblets.

210
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:28,308
Oh, isn't that...grotesque.

211
00:14:28,308 --> 00:14:30,558
Oh, it's a little smeared. 
 Can you make that out?

212
00:14:30,558 --> 00:14:32,531
Oh yeah, wait a minute.

213
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:37,235
"My darling.  My passion
 for you lives forever."

214
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:42,559
Oh, I can just weep from the beauty
 that is my parents' union.

215
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,230
"Yours forever Paul Zalasnick."
  Paul Zalasnick?

216
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:49,432
**************

217
00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:54,709
The butcher.  Oh my god,
 is my mother having an affair?

218
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:57,729
Fran?  Fran?

219
00:14:57,729 --> 00:15:00,286
Here, here, here, here. 
/ No, I don't, I don't want it.

220
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:04,750
I was thinking, Daddy's not
 in the mood for chicken.

221
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,407
Oh, can you blame him?

222
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:12,828
You know, I thought I'd make spaghetti. 
 Make sure there's enough ketchup. / All right.

223
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:16,158
My mother and the butcher. 
 Could this be happening?

224
00:15:16,158 --> 00:15:19,780
Oh come on, Miss Fine, we don't know for
 certain that note was meant for your mother.

225
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,530
I mean, there are plenty of ways
 it could have gotten into the chicken.

226
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,483
How?  It sat on it?
 / There you go.

227
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:29,058
Oh god, everyone,
 come and see.

228
00:15:33,302 --> 00:15:37,670
I hope no great expectations
 accompany this outfit.

229
00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:41,759
I brought this for Daddy 
to wear in the Poconos.

230
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,080
The poor guy was living 
in a fool's paradise.

231
00:15:45,618 --> 00:15:48,407
Thanks for your help.  You know, 
if this heiress thing doesn't work out,

232
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:51,446
you could have a great career
 in fluffing and folding.

233
00:15:51,446 --> 00:15:53,699
Thanks, Kenny.  Shalom.

234
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:58,747
Oh... You know, I hear Jewish men
 make excellent husbands.

235
00:15:58,747 --> 00:16:00,935
I wonder who
 she heard that from?

236
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:04,766
Probably Niles.  He's always
 buzzing something in her ear.

237
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,920
Don't you think Kenny looks 
just like Luke Perry?

238
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,079
Poor thing.  
She's as blind as my father.

239
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:21,554
Ow! / Shh!  You're gonna
 wake up Mister Sheffield!

240
00:16:21,902 --> 00:16:24,053
Oh, it's all right.  
I'm already awake.

241
00:16:24,053 --> 00:16:27,419
Brighton's having that
 kick boxing dream again.

242
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,718
Oh, Brighton.  Honey, go sleep
 with your sisters.  Come on.

243
00:16:31,718 --> 00:16:35,720
Oh, C.C.'s in there. / Well, she's
 used to getting kicked out of bed.

244
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,214
Ow! 
/ Oh, sorry.

245
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:42,575
Peace at last!

246
00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:45,327
Oh, for heaven sakes.

247
00:16:46,183 --> 00:16:48,243
Miss Fine!
 / Ow!

248
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:50,701
Oh, sorry, old man.
 / Blast it.

249
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:53,975
Even Gilligan had a hammock.

250
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:59,338
Miss Fine, it's three a.m.
 / Who can sleep?

251
00:16:59,338 --> 00:17:01,820
Well, I wouldn't mind having 
a crack at it.

252
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:07,180
Look at this picture of my mother
 and father at their thirtieth anniversary.

253
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,247
You think you know someone.  
Who is this stranger I call Ma?

254
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:13,583
The same person she always was.

255
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:17,437
The one who made this house warmer 
than all the islands in the Caribbean.

256
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:21,079
Oh, yeah.  Did she have to warm up 
half of Queens, too?

257
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:27,635
Don't you realize the entire foundation
 by which I judge all relationships 
is just crumbling before my eyes.

258
00:17:27,635 --> 00:17:30,238
Oh, Miss Fine, you don't need
 to lose your faith in marriage,

259
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:33,050
just because your mother
 turns out to be human.

260
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,728
Oh, there was a Jerry Vale tape
 in the veal!...

261
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:53,924
Maxwell, I hope you don't mind, 
but Brighton insisted we trade places.

262
00:17:56,016 --> 00:17:57,456
Ah,

263
00:17:58,435 --> 00:17:59,908
there...

264
00:18:00,354 --> 00:18:03,600
If you're looking for
 the hot water bottle,

265
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,872
that's not it.

266
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:18,393
More sausage?  Breakfast cake? 
/ Right here.

267
00:18:18,393 --> 00:18:24,872
Eat up, eat up. / You'd love that, wouldn't you?
 The faster we eat the sooner you could go shopping.

268
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,568
I'm through dusting, Mrs. Fine. 
 Can be of any further service?

269
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:33,456
Ma, you're not making her play 
cleaning girl, are you?

270
00:18:33,456 --> 00:18:37,732
She does a good job. 
 I can see myself in the couch.

271
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:40,575
At the end of the day, 
I get paid a dollar.

272
00:18:40,575 --> 00:18:45,230
A dollar, Ma?
 / Well, she's got no experience.

273
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:48,710
Unlike some people I know.
 / What are you talking about?

274
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,051
Like you don't know. 
/ Fran, I'd like to see you in the kitchen.

275
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:56,287
No, Ma, I'd like to see you in the kitchen. 
/ Fine.  Have it your way.

276
00:19:00,315 --> 00:19:04,676
What's with you?  Me?
  What's with you?

277
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:08,467
Excuse us.

278
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:10,671
We'll start lunch.

279
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:15,812
Okay, Ma, I wanna know, for once
 and for all, what is going on here.

280
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:17,404
What are you talking about?

281
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:21,385
Oh, chop sirloin, extra lean.
  Look at this.

282
00:19:21,385 --> 00:19:23,909
Paulie, the butcher,
 takes very good care of me.

283
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:28,513
Well, I'll bet.  Oh, look it here. 
 Mail's in.

284
00:19:28,513 --> 00:19:33,214
Fran, have you been going through 
my meat? It's not what you think.

285
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:36,271
Ma, you and the butcher?
  How could you?

286
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:39,515
Fran, you're blowing it all 
out of proportion.  All we do is...

287
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:43,173
Oh, please.  No details. 
 Once I get a picture in my head...

288
00:19:43,173 --> 00:19:46,049
It's just a little innocent flirting.

289
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:49,116
You mean you're not having an affair?
 / No, of course not.

290
00:19:49,116 --> 00:19:54,233
He winks at me.  And I tell him what
 a nice rump he has today,

291
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:59,966
and I, I get a roast half-price. 
/ Ma, you tramp.

292
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:04,237
Hey, we're on a fixed income here. 
/ Yeah, well what would Daddy say if he found out?

293
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:07,624
He knows.
  Sometimes he comes down

294
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:11,199
and he watches 
Paulie give me the meat.

295
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:17,673
This is like
 a really bad Geraldo.

296
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,597
You can make fun 
because you're young.

297
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:25,942
You're still turning heads.  
For me, not so much anymore.

298
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:30,597
But when Paul Zalasnick winks
 at me with his good eye,

299
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:35,026
I feel young again, too.

300
00:20:35,372 --> 00:20:39,780
What's the matter? 
/ I think I can live with this.

301
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,208
As long as you and
 Daddy still love each other.

302
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,804
Of course we do. 
 And I'll tell you a little secret.

303
00:20:45,804 --> 00:20:49,789
Your father and I have better
 sex with a full freezer.

304
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:54,920
Ma, I'm getting a picture!  
Oh, they'll be no sleeping tonight.

305
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:03,628
Wheel of Fortune!

306
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:07,635
Come on, Ma, it's a new one.

307
00:21:07,635 --> 00:21:10,086
Here, Brighton, try this.

308
00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:14,023
Mmm, not bad.  What is it? 
/ Stuffed derma.  Delish.

309
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,593
What's a derma? / Skin.

310
00:21:16,593 --> 00:21:19,862
No, sweetheart, it's not skin.
  It's intestines.

311
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,834
Morty, get out of the bathroom!

312
00:21:23,807 --> 00:21:26,530
So I thought after med school
 I'd go into stand-by comedy.

313
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:29,590
Sort of a big joke on my parents.

314
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,762
Oh, buy a vowel, you twit!

315
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:35,965
So everything's sorted out 
with your parents? / Oh, yeah.

316
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:40,416
They're like the Rock of Gibraltar. 
 I don't know what you were so worried about.

317
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,602
Can we come back here
 next year for our vacation?

318
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,653
Yes, we are having 
a good time, aren't we?

319
00:21:45,653 --> 00:21:50,393
That's because we're all together.
 Oh, who needs the Caribbean anyway?

320
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:53,548
The roads are clear, 
the airport's open!

321
00:21:53,783 --> 00:21:57,062
All right, kids, pack it up.
  We're out of this dump.

322
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,726
Oh-we, oh-we, baby.

323
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,044
Oh-we, oh-we, baby.

324
00:22:15,397 --> 00:22:21,456
Oh-we, oh-we, baby. Won't you
 let me take you on a sea cruise.

325
00:22:21,722 --> 00:22:24,224
Where, where's Brighton?

326
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,128
More tongue?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
