1
00:00:04,547 --> 00:00:07,833
Ah, that sales clerk was so rude.

2
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:10,649
Oh, I know.  You ask to try
 on twenty pairs of shoes,

3
00:00:10,649 --> 00:00:13,202
and right away 
they get an attitude.

4
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:14,585
Hi, Fran.

5
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:19,581
Oh, Maggie.  What're you doin' 
home so early?  Are you sick?

6
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:23,463
Ah!  I better not catch anything.
 I got unemployment tomorrow.

7
00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:26,973
Honey, I feel terrible. 
 Here I was out shopping,

8
00:00:26,973 --> 00:00:30,150
and you were home sick with
 no one to take care of you.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,009
I beg your pardon.  I'm perfectly
 capable of taking care of Miss Margaret.

10
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:36,817
Oh ... actually, I'm not really sick.

11
00:00:36,817 --> 00:00:41,602
It's only ... you know ...
 my monthly friend.

12
00:00:41,602 --> 00:00:43,927
She's all yours.

13
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:46,714
I don't get it.  
What's goin' on here?

14
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,385
Val, what comes 
at the end of a sentence?

15
00:00:49,385 --> 00:00:51,438
A parole?

16
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:56,844
You might have noticed that Val is
 not short for valedictorian.

17
00:00:57,297 --> 00:01:00,870
Now, come on.  What gives?  You've had 
your period four times this month.

18
00:01:01,138 --> 00:01:04,459
So? / So, women don't get 
their period every week.

19
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:08,134
If they did, all the men in the world
 would be institutionalized.

20
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,921
Which wouldn't necessarily 
effect my social life.

21
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:15,540
Now, what gives?  You're not havin'
 problems with your boyfriend.

22
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,954
You're not failing any classes.  
You're trying to get out of gym.

23
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:23,369
Oh ... I have gymnastics
 this semester.

24
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:26,047
Ach!  The worst!

25
00:01:26,047 --> 00:01:30,854
Oh, the horse, the bars, the rope.
  Oh, I hated the rope.

26
00:01:30,854 --> 00:01:33,991
To this day, I can't even look
 at an extension cord.

27
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:37,682
Thank God you know how I feel. 
 So you'll let me stay home?

28
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:43,317
No.  Honey, every once in a while 
you gotta pull up those gym shorts,

29
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:46,683
lace up those high-tops, 
and face your fears.

30
00:01:46,683 --> 00:01:50,455
Or you could do what Fran did
 write phony notes.

31
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:54,746
Val, turn your head 
sideways a sec.

32
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,651
Did you know you can see clear
 through your ears?

33
00:01:59,632 --> 00:02:03,487
This is a completely 
different situation.

34
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:07,225
She doesn't have our gym teacher.  
You know, after World War Two,

35
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:10,558
a lot of Nazis fled down
 to South America.

36
00:02:10,558 --> 00:02:13,369
She came to P.S. Nineteen.

37
00:03:01,905 --> 00:03:05,282
No, Maggie, I am not writing
 you a phony excuse.

38
00:03:05,282 --> 00:03:09,785
Oh, c'mon, Fran.  My gym teacher hates me.  
She goes out of her way to make me look stupid.

39
00:03:09,785 --> 00:03:13,054
There's a tough job.
 / Oh, shut up, Brighton.

40
00:03:13,322 --> 00:03:17,610
Come on, Fran.  Please. 
 Just till gymnastics is over.
 You've gotta get me through till volleyball.

41
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,758
No, I'm a nanny now. 
 I took an oath.

42
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:24,384
Fran, she won't even let me 
wear make-up in class.

43
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:27,381
Oh, she's gotta be stopped.

44
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:33,109
Well, all right, but only because I know 
what it's like to be a pathetic klutz.

45
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:35,088
I knew you'd understand.

46
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:39,169
All right, let's use one of my favorite
 excuses, and I hope one of yours.

47
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:41,798
A hammer toe.

48
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:43,530
A hammer toe? 
/ Uh-huh.

49
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,245
What's that? 
/ It's a cruel, crippling disease

50
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:49,453
caused by shoving your feet into high
 heels that are too small.

51
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:54,087
And if you don't think that sounds painful, 
just ask my Uncle Harvey.

52
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:58,426
You know, it won't work.  It ... 
it has to be something undetectable.  
Something she can't see.

53
00:03:58,426 --> 00:04:02,376
Then it should have something 
to do with your chest.

54
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:05,549
Shut up, you little troll.

55
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:10,854
How 'bout severe depression brought on by
 feelings of inadequacy and the fear of death?

56
00:04:11,153 --> 00:04:13,926
Gracie, where do you come up
 with these things?

57
00:04:13,926 --> 00:04:16,672
Usually during hopscotch.

58
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:21,113
Miss Fein, I'd like next Friday off.
 Could you write Mr. Sheffield a note for me?

59
00:04:21,113 --> 00:04:26,433
I think I'd like an attractive disease. 
 Perhaps something that requires an eye patch.

60
00:04:27,048 --> 00:04:32,801
Niles, would this happen to be your not-so-subtle
 way of saying you disapprove of me?

61
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:36,096
Not at all.  I delight in each 
and every antic.

62
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:38,885
Just think of me as one of those people
 who slows down on the highway

63
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:42,833
to view the wreck and then goes 
on his merry way.

64
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:45,929
You know, Mags, now I could be
 wrong here, but ...

65
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:49,966
I think Dad would be pretty upset 
if he found out about this whole note thing.

66
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:53,222
How's he gonna find out? 
/ I'm gonna tell him.

67
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:55,957
Unless you and 
I can cut a deal.

68
00:04:55,957 --> 00:04:58,329
Listen, you maggot, breathe
 one word of this to Dad

69
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:01,559
and I'll pull your tongue out 
through your zipper.

70
00:05:02,523 --> 00:05:05,404
I do believe we have a deal.

71
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:23,479
Niles, please,
 I'm trying to work!

72
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:26,863
As opposed to what I'm doing,
 which is a hobby?

73
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,514
You wanted to see me, Mr. Sheffield?
 / Oh, yes, Miss Fein.

74
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:36,290
I got the strangest call today 
from Maggie's school.

75
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:40,722
Oh, look, traffic's backing up. 
 I wonder what's ahead.

76
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:45,302
Do you know anything about her having
 a ... a heart murmur?

77
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:47,862
Heart murmur, heart murmur ....

78
00:05:48,843 --> 00:05:50,969
Murmur of the heart.

79
00:05:51,411 --> 00:05:54,299
No, no, I ... 
it doesn't ring a bell.

80
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:57,913
Well, it seems she's been feigning
 illness to get out of gym class.

81
00:05:57,913 --> 00:06:01,450
Oh, it's a massive pile-up.

82
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,873
You wouldn't happen to know anything 
about that, would you, Miss Fein?

83
00:06:03,873 --> 00:06:07,466
They're going to need the Jaws 
of Life for this one.

84
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:10,281
Oh, Miss Babcock, Miss Babcock. 
 It's so nice to see you.

85
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:13,113
You know, we gotta spend more
 time with each other.

86
00:06:13,113 --> 00:06:16,883
Oh, that little rubber band in
 your head finally snapped.

87
00:06:19,222 --> 00:06:22,501
Maxwell, I have wonderful news.  
I think I have solved our casting problem.

88
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:25,020
What about Alan Beck to play the lead?

89
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,068
Oh, Alan Beck.  I love him.

90
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:31,503
No, I don't think so.
 / Why would I lie?

91
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:35,824
Maxwell, Alan Beck is a living legend. 
 He's won two Academy Awards. 
 He just won a Tony.

92
00:06:35,824 --> 00:06:39,177
And next he's goin' to Disneyland!

93
00:06:39,517 --> 00:06:43,242
Miss Fein, please. 
 Alan Beck is a demon.

94
00:06:43,242 --> 00:06:47,739
When I first started in the theater, I ...
 I worked as his gopher. He treated me like dirt.

95
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:49,417
Oh, he can't be that bad.

96
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:53,254
One time I forgot to put lemon in his tea.
  He set me on fire.

97
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:58,099
Well, there are two sides
 to every story.

98
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:03,080
What's the other side to that? 
 I was a twenty-year-old boy 
set ablaze by a madman.

99
00:07:03,446 --> 00:07:06,233
Well, you're not
 a twenty-year-old boy anymore.

100
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,956
You're a big macha producer.

101
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:11,214
Yes, but I'm still flammable.

102
00:07:11,214 --> 00:07:15,517
I think I'm at that point in my career
 where I can choose who I work with.

103
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:19,936
Alan Beck's name on a marquis 
can pre-sell a six-month run.

104
00:07:19,936 --> 00:07:22,117
I choose him.

105
00:07:22,352 --> 00:07:26,062
Well, Mr. Sheffield, this is 
a very big decision you've made.

106
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:28,228
You know, it was just like 
I was telling Maggie.

107
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:30,341
You've got to confront your fears.

108
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:33,905
Maggie, that's right.  Now ... now what's
 this about her cutting gym class?

109
00:07:33,905 --> 00:07:37,483
Just when the roadway 
had finally cleared...

110
00:07:38,145 --> 00:07:42,218
some idiot swerved into
 oncoming traffic.

111
00:07:42,218 --> 00:07:46,209
Oh, Mr. Sheffield ... don't worry about 
Maggie.  I'll take care of her.

112
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:48,480
You just get yourself flame retarded

113
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,898
and you, keep it movin', keep it movin',
 there's nothin' to see here.

114
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:08,391
Oh, wow, does this bring back memories.
  Bad memories.

115
00:08:09,127 --> 00:08:12,722
Oh, the ring.  Good ol' ring ....

116
00:08:14,505 --> 00:08:17,884
I have no use for rings unless 
someone's puttin' one on my finger.

117
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:21,100
This was my event. 
/ What'd you do on that?

118
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,396
Ah, nevermind.

119
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:29,951
Fran, I'm dead. 
 What're we gonna say?

120
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,987
Well, then just tell her the truth. 
 That your pacemaker's workin' perfectly.

121
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:38,037
God, it's not gonna work.  Coach Stone 
is gonna torture me this whole semester.

122
00:08:38,037 --> 00:08:43,464
Oh, honey, you're makin' a big deal over 
what lasts a grand total of four minutes.

123
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:46,438
What are you talking about?  
Gym class lasts forty-five minutes.

124
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:50,495
Listen and learn.  First you
 gotta get dressed.

125
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:53,386
Take your time. 
 You're not a fireman.

126
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:58,138
Now you volunteer to get the equipment,
 which is very heavy.

127
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:01,843
So you pull something.  It could be 
a side ache, a charley-horse,

128
00:09:01,843 --> 00:09:05,925
a hernia, depending on how much time 
you need.  Twelve minutes.

129
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:08,529
God, I was good.

130
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:10,705
What're we down to?
 / I have twenty minutes.

131
00:09:10,705 --> 00:09:14,487
All right, just enough time 
to look for your contact.

132
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,926
Fran, you don't wear contacts. 
/ Exactly.

133
00:09:16,926 --> 00:09:20,591
Do you know how long it takes to find
 a contact that doesn't exist?

134
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,156
Sixteen minutes, which brings us down
 to a grand total of four minutes. It's a cinch.

135
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:28,243
Anyone could get through
 four minutes of gym,

136
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:30,718
even if you had my old teacher,
 Miss Wickervich.

137
00:09:30,718 --> 00:09:33,409
We used to call her
 the Wickervich of the West.

138
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:36,164
... Ah ....

139
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,495
Hello, Fein.
 / Miss Wickervich!

140
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:46,217
Long time no see. 
/ Your old gym teacher's my gym teacher?

141
00:09:46,217 --> 00:09:50,807
Small world. / Ah, nobody move. 
 I think I've lost my contacts.

142
00:09:57,558 --> 00:10:04,151
Well, Fein, I see you've recovered 
from the series of ailments that plagued
 you as a teenager, huh?

143
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:08,889
Well, I still got some of the old shoulder 
mishagas.  You know, when it's damp ....

144
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:12,495
Meanwhile, you look fabulous. 
 Why'd you change your name?

145
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:15,621
I got married. 
/ To a man?

146
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:21,375
So you're married and I'm not? 
 How could this be?

147
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,257
I'll tell you how.  You're soft.

148
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:27,649
You were soft then ... 
and you're soft now.

149
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:32,174
And you're raising soft children
 with heart murmurs.

150
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:38,900
Is any of this gonna affect my grade? 
/ Oh, you bet your soft, squishy little butt.

151
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:42,519
If you don't pass those midterms
 next week, your grade is an "F."

152
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:47,691
But that's not fair. 
/ Ah, life is not fair.  Ask the old maid.

153
00:10:48,318 --> 00:10:52,224
Don't worry, Maggie, you're gonna pass
 that test 'cause I'm gonna coach you.

154
00:10:52,224 --> 00:10:53,481
You!?

155
00:10:53,481 --> 00:10:56,618
Ha ... ha ... ha ....

156
00:10:57,022 --> 00:11:00,443
Oh, that's so rich.  
You're like a French Poodle.

157
00:11:00,443 --> 00:11:05,084
You're all poofy and perfect. 
 But let 'em down and what do you got?

158
00:11:05,507 --> 00:11:07,591
A wet poodle?

159
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:10,881
I'm gonna make her suffer.

160
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:16,784
I'm gonna torture you so bad you are
 going to beg me to kill you.

161
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:27,068
You know, marriage has mellowed her.

162
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:38,393
Where the hell is Alan Beck?  First day of
 rehearsals and we're already two hours behind.

163
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:43,045
Everybody out!  There's a bomb threat! 
 We're threatening to open with this plot ....

164
00:11:46,848 --> 00:11:51,436
No explosion. 
 It's worse than a bomb. It's a dud.

165
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:56,424
Who are you? 
/ Maxwell Sheffield.

166
00:11:57,113 --> 00:11:59,948
You look familiar. 
/ Yeah, well ...

167
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:03,531
we ... worked together 
some time ago in London.

168
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:05,564
I was your assistant.

169
00:12:05,564 --> 00:12:09,754
Good.  Get me some coffee.
 / Actually, I'm the producer now.

170
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:12,382
With cream.

171
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:15,439
Who are you, blondie?

172
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:18,492
I'm C.C. Babcock. 
 I'm Mr. Sheffield's business associate.

173
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:23,005
Yeah, I got a slew of those myself.
  But I got Thursday open.

174
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,876
I'll be in my dressing room, Sheffield. 
/ Oh, Mr. Sheffield ....

175
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:30,765
Whoa.  And who is this lovely creature?  
Put Thursday on hold, blondie.

176
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:34,923
Oh, Alan Beck, I just love you!

177
00:12:34,923 --> 00:12:37,153
Oh, then we have a lot in common.

178
00:12:37,402 --> 00:12:41,991
You must be my leading lady.
 / Oh, no.  I'm Fran Fein, the nanny.

179
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:45,855
Some nanny.  You know, there's
 a little boy inside me.

180
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:48,981
Wanna raise him?

181
00:12:51,574 --> 00:12:56,095
Well, what's the problem?  
I think he's very charming.

182
00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:59,461
Well, thank you for your professional
 opinion, Miss Fein.

183
00:12:59,461 --> 00:13:01,814
So how did your meeting with
 Maggie's gym teacher go?

184
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,578
Oh, great.  I talked her into 
giving Maggie a make-up test.

185
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:07,465
I'll need a credit card. 
/ Oh, yeah

186
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:15,071
Wait a minute, do you intend to bribe her? 
/ No.  But only 'cause I didn't think of it first.

187
00:13:15,342 --> 00:13:18,534
So ...????
 / New exercise outfit.

188
00:13:18,534 --> 00:13:21,306
My grandpa always said, 
"You must look your best."

189
00:13:21,306 --> 00:13:23,861
He insisted on being buried 
in a tuxedo.

190
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:29,905
Unfortunately, it was a rental,
 which could be the reason for 
my family's horrible credit rating.

191
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:32,920
Sheffield!
 / Oh, God, what now?  More coffee?

192
00:13:33,468 --> 00:13:36,656
I've been re-thinking 
act two.  It's a downer.

193
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:38,718
You got my character 
in a wheelchair.

194
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:41,083
What woman in the audience
 is gonna believe

195
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:45,001
that Alan Beck is paralyzed 
from the waist down?

196
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:49,645
Alan, you're playing Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt.

197
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:53,103
The man was a paraplegic.

198
00:13:53,103 --> 00:13:55,456
Find a cure.

199
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:06,393
You call that 
a backhand spring layout?

200
00:14:06,393 --> 00:14:07,847
Shape up!

201
00:14:08,354 --> 00:14:11,527
I've seen better
 routines in gymboree.

202
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:15,611
You old Mary Lou Rotten ....

203
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:20,636
Well, look who's here.  
Olga Naudia.

204
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,332
Have a good practice, girls?

205
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:28,553
I have to get home to dinner.
  A romantic dinner

206
00:14:28,553 --> 00:14:31,262
... with my husband.

207
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:33,256
You know what that's like, 
don't you, Fran?

208
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:37,051
Oh, that's right.  You don't.

209
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:40,055
Oh, forget her.  We'll show her.

210
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:41,817
Are you ready? 
/ I'm ready.

211
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:44,606
Are you really ready? 
/ I'm really ready.

212
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:48,734
I can't hear you, Sheffield!
 / I'm really ready!!!!

213
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:51,687
All right, then, let's go!!!

214
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:53,366
Ow!

215
00:14:59,174 --> 00:15:00,860
Tea time.

216
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:06,542
Are we feeling any better?

217
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:09,192
Do I look like I'm feeling 
any better?

218
00:15:09,192 --> 00:15:11,486
A woman with an electrical 
appliance around her neck

219
00:15:11,486 --> 00:15:15,738
and her feet in water should
 remember who her friends are.

220
00:15:16,344 --> 00:15:19,633
Ow!  Ah!  Oy!

221
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,606
Listen to me. I sound like 
a kevetchy Kathy doll.

222
00:15:24,654 --> 00:15:29,781
God, I hate dealing with actors!
  They ruin the theater.

223
00:15:29,982 --> 00:15:33,361
May I get you something, sir?  
Scotch and soda?  Gin and tonic?  Martini?

224
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:34,908
Yes.

225
00:15:36,472 --> 00:15:39,408
I wonder if Flo Zeigfeld 
had all these problems.

226
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:43,105
I think his problems started 
when they named him Flo.

227
00:15:46,301 --> 00:15:49,205
Oh, good, I haven't missed happy hour.

228
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:53,727
Oh ....

229
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,359
That Alan Beck'll be 
the death of me yet.

230
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:00,761
He insists on playing FDR as
 a swash-buckling paraplegic

231
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:04,964
who leaps out of his wheelchair at will,
 screaming, "It's a miracle."

232
00:16:06,284 --> 00:16:11,352
Well, if you want him to stay in his chair,
 I know someone that could break his legs.

233
00:16:11,352 --> 00:16:16,744
Ow!  And she wears sneakers
 so he'll never hear her coming.

234
00:16:17,466 --> 00:16:20,330
I take it all is not well
 in the olympic village.

235
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:25,172
Who would have thought that we'd 
both be facing demons from our past.

236
00:16:25,172 --> 00:16:30,166
I can't believe I'd hire
 a paramaniacal sociopath.

237
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,717
Yeah, well, that was pretty stupid.

238
00:16:32,717 --> 00:16:35,618
Mine was just a coincidence.

239
00:16:35,618 --> 00:16:39,022
Ah, come on, Miss Fein.  Why don't 
you just stand up to her?

240
00:16:39,022 --> 00:16:43,301
You're not in high school anymore.
  You're a big macha nanny ....

241
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:46,439
Oh, no, let me. 
/ Thank you.

242
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:49,270
Well, why don't you take
 some of your own advice?

243
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,767
I mean, if the guy's 
making you miserable,

244
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:54,224
why don't you just stand up to him?

245
00:16:54,224 --> 00:16:56,201
Because he'll quit ...

246
00:16:56,201 --> 00:16:57,946
and he's brilliant.

247
00:16:57,946 --> 00:17:02,362
Nah, the worst that'll happen
 is he'll set you on fire again.

248
00:17:02,362 --> 00:17:06,597
How many times can he do
 that before it gets old?

249
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,098
Thank you, Miss Fein.

250
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:09,598
Ah!!!!

251
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,860
Oh!

252
00:17:12,853 --> 00:17:13,830
... Ahh ....

253
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:16,808
Ahhh!!!

254
00:17:25,806 --> 00:17:29,085
Can't you just say hello 
like a normal person?

255
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:32,641
I've been looking forward to 
this for quite some time.

256
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:35,269
What's with you?  What, do you
 like to see young girls suffer?

257
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:38,838
Oh, yeah.  Especially if they cry.

258
00:17:38,838 --> 00:17:41,602
Okay, Sheffield, I set up
 five stations for you.

259
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,654
Each of them is worth twenty 
points.  Start with the ropes.

260
00:17:44,654 --> 00:17:48,094
**********************

261
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:52,414
Honey, go out there hold your head up 
high, don't forget to breathe,

262
00:17:52,414 --> 00:17:55,688
and above all, watch for your nails.

263
00:18:27,185 --> 00:18:29,209
She stinks.

264
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:34,728
Well, it's better to have tried and
 stunk than never to have stunk at all.

265
00:18:36,842 --> 00:18:41,287
Look, she has been working her butt off.
 I think that she deserves something for it.

266
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,264
I'm gonna give her something.  An "F."

267
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:46,311
I love my job ....

268
00:18:50,343 --> 00:18:53,022
What kind of a teacher 
are you anyway?

269
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:56,449
Teachers are supposed to educate,
 not intimidate!

270
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:59,292
What's the matter, cat got your tongue?

271
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:02,305
You're choking?  Why didn't you 
tell me you were choking?

272
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:05,566
This is the international 
sign for choking.

273
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:09,467
Well, now I know.  
All right, okay, focus.

274
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:14,299
Oh, Mrs. Stone, are you okay?

275
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:18,635
Oh, you saved my life.

276
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:21,477
You saved my life!?

277
00:19:23,543 --> 00:19:26,628
Well, I might not have passed gym,
 but lucky for you,

278
00:19:26,628 --> 00:19:32,342
I passed the Heimlich poster every
 Sunday at Fun Lums Chinese Restaurant.

279
00:19:32,342 --> 00:19:38,566
So how'd I do? / Oh, you did great,
 honey.  You got an "A."  Right?

280
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:42,318
Right.

281
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:47,354
Really?  'Cause I felt like
 I was really on.

282
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:57,311
... forty-eight.  No matinees.

283
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,518
My understudy's good enough for
 the blue-haired ladies.

284
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:04,760
Forty-nine?  I want a personal
 trainer. Young, dumb, stacked.

285
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:10,436
And fifty .. I want ...
 I want this.

286
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:14,900
Ah, Alan, before you go ...

287
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,598
I have a couple of 
demands of my own.

288
00:20:17,598 --> 00:20:19,234
Oh, really?

289
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:21,598
Yeah ....

290
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:26,327
From now on, I'll give 
the orders around here,

291
00:20:26,327 --> 00:20:29,669
and you will conduct yourself
 in a professional manner.

292
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:34,940
Or?
 / Or ...

293
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:51,757
or you're fired.

294
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:53,314
You're bluffing.

295
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,621
Try me.

296
00:20:56,098 --> 00:20:59,219
C'mon, Sheffield. 
 You know as well as I know ...

297
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:03,790
that no one can play this role
 as well as Alan Beck.

298
00:21:04,742 --> 00:21:07,263
I am F.D.R.

299
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:19,559
December seventh ...
 nineteen forty-one.

300
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:23,465
A date that will live in infamy.

301
00:21:24,035 --> 00:21:26,988
The only thing we have to fear ...

302
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:30,089
is fear itself.

303
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:34,080
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, 
Anthony Hopkins called again

304
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,472
and he wants to know whether
 he should bring his own wheelchair.

305
00:21:37,472 --> 00:21:40,779
That guy is such a pest. 
 / Oh, man.

306
00:21:41,153 --> 00:21:44,704
Whatever Tony wants is just fine.
 / Ah.

307
00:21:45,645 --> 00:21:48,218
You know, Sheffield,
 I've been thinking ... maybe

308
00:21:48,218 --> 00:21:51,454
some of my demands
 might be negotiable.

309
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:54,426
Some of your demands?

310
00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:56,477
All right, all of 'em ...

311
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,284
but I'm keeping this.

312
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:04,546
Thank you.

313
00:22:04,546 --> 00:22:08,172
Thank you very much. 
Miss Babcock has your checks.

314
00:22:09,304 --> 00:22:11,419
You were great.  Thank you.

315
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:13,961
Very believble.

316
00:22:15,975 --> 00:22:18,306
Anthony Hopkins, Miss Fein?

317
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:21,351
Nice touch.

318
00:22:21,351 --> 00:22:23,661
My accent was pretty good,
 huh, Mr. Sheffield?

319
00:22:23,661 --> 00:22:27,076
Maybe I should play Eleanor Roosevelt. 
 I know all her lines.

320
00:22:27,076 --> 00:22:31,615
"Ah, look at all the lonely people."

321
00:22:32,155 --> 00:22:35,357
That was Eleanor Rigby.
 / Oh.

322
00:22:35,962 --> 00:22:39,943
Don't quit your day job.
 / Oh ... I won't.

323
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,909
Look at that class of eighty-two.

324
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:58,787
Hm, hm, hm, what
 a bunch of losers.

325
00:22:59,174 --> 00:23:01,146
Look at your hair, Fein.

326
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,545
Oh, that was
 the Farah Fawcett look.

327
00:23:04,545 --> 00:23:08,040
Wait a minute.  Is that Danny
 Imperiali with his arm around you?

328
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,791
Yeah.  He was my boyfriend.

329
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:10,830
Oh ....

330
00:23:11,243 --> 00:23:15,104
"A boy like that would
 kill your brother."

331
00:23:15,591 --> 00:23:18,866
No.  He's not that bad. 
 Sometimes I still wonder.

332
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:22,283
"Forget that boy and find another."

333
00:23:22,557 --> 00:23:27,056
Ooh. / "One of your own kind ... 
stick to your own kind."
