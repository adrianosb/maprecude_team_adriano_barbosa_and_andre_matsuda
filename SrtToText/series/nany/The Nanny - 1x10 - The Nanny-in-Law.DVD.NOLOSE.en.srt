1
00:00:02,624 --> 00:00:06,531
I'm so excited we're gonna get to 
meet Mister Sheffield's nanny.

2
00:00:06,531 --> 00:00:11,625
He must have been so cute as a baby
 in his little pram with
 his little silver pacifier

3
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,789
and his little
 three-piece diaper.

4
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:17,584
Oh yes, he was 
a little stinker.

5
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:21,174
I remember his first word:
 Niles!

6
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,518
Niles!

7
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:27,406
We're gonna have to work
 on his vocabulary.

8
00:00:27,406 --> 00:00:30,436
Niles, Niles, there you are.
  I want you standing by.

9
00:00:30,436 --> 00:00:33,066
Standing by what, sir?
 / Me.

10
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:37,845
I want everything perfect for Nanny.  
All right, girls, let's get your curtseys.

11
00:00:38,623 --> 00:00:40,565
No, no, no.  
Backs straight.

12
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:44,440
I'm getting the feeling 
he's done that before.

13
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,194
Niles, that's the doorbell.

14
00:00:48,194 --> 00:00:51,398
Oh, sir, I would be
 lost without you.

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,120
Nanny Mueller!

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,150
Oh, Maxwell, my liebchen.

17
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,261
Look how handsome 
you've become.

18
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:12,949
You're the image of 
your father at that age.

19
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:17,335
He had a head of hair just
 like yours, and then one day, Kojak.

20
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:20,880
Nanny, you look wonderful.

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,560
I'd like you to meet...
/ No, not another word.

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,863
I feel as if I know them.

23
00:01:25,863 --> 00:01:30,330
You must be Margaret.
 / No, I'm Grace.

24
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,378
Well, if somebody sent me a snapshot
 once in a while, maybe I would know them.

25
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:38,356
I'm Maggie, Nanny Mueller.
 / Well, button up, dear.

26
00:01:38,356 --> 00:01:42,014
If Victoria can keep
 her secrets, so can you.

27
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:45,091
And, Brighton...

28
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:47,700
you call this 
a handshake?

29
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,224
What are you, 
a man or a fish?

30
00:01:50,224 --> 00:01:52,523
Actually, I'm a Pisces.

31
00:01:52,523 --> 00:01:57,390
You, young man,
 I will be watching.

32
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,137
All right, Maxwell, 
I'm impressed.

33
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:04,086
You obviously found yourself 
a proper nanny to rear the children.

34
00:02:04,086 --> 00:02:08,457
Brighton, what did you put down 
the toilet?  It's all stuffed up.

35
00:02:08,457 --> 00:02:10,687
Oh, you're here already? 
 Hello.

36
00:02:10,687 --> 00:02:13,390
Who is this person,
 the plumber?

37
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,193
Nanny Mueller, I'd like you 
to meet Fran Fine, the nanny.

38
00:02:20,203 --> 00:02:22,048
Nice to meet you.

39
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:25,810
Niles, take the woman's coat. 
 She's got a sweat moustache.

40
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,159
Oops, my mistake.

41
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:28,524
Well, your home is charming.

42
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:31,562
It amazes me what 
you've been able to do, Maxwell.

43
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:34,292
And all from putting 
on your little plays.

44
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:38,258
Oh, they're not so little.  
He lost over a million on the last one.

45
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:44,082
So, tell me, Margaret,
 you plan to go on the stage?

46
00:03:44,082 --> 00:03:46,239
Uh, no, I don't think so.

47
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,003
Oh, well, then we don't need to be 
made up like a showgirl, do we?

48
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:55,092
So, Nanny Mueller,
 how was your passage?

49
00:03:55,092 --> 00:03:59,296
Well, the Q.E. Two is always splendid, 
but the food has fallen off a bit.

50
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:02,459
Go eat on a boat.  I took the kids
 on the Staten Island Ferry;

51
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,408
I swear half-a-hotdog and we're
 pulling whiskers out of our teeth.

52
00:04:06,408 --> 00:04:08,609
Sausage, anyone?

53
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:11,421
Miss Fine, is it?

54
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:15,113
Which agency exactly was it that 
arranged for your position here?

55
00:04:15,113 --> 00:04:19,893
Oh, I didn't come through an agency.
  Mister Sheffield hired me
 right off the street.

56
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:25,285
Well, it's not like it sounds.  
I tried her out for the weekend first.

57
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:33,411
So, Nanny Mueller, how long are
 you planning on staying?  A week?

58
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:35,127
Or so.

59
00:04:35,127 --> 00:04:38,247
It's the "or so"
 I'm worried about.

60
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:40,607
Miss Fine, you know, in my day,

61
00:04:40,607 --> 00:04:43,972
the nanny always sat in the kitchen
 with the rest of the staff.

62
00:04:43,972 --> 00:04:49,135
Well, those days are over.  
You just sit right here with us.

63
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:54,296
Make yourself at home.

64
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:58,986
I see you have, at the table
 and out of uniform.

65
00:04:58,986 --> 00:05:02,287
Oh, here in America we're 
a little less formal.

66
00:05:02,287 --> 00:05:05,226
When in Rome, Fraulein...

67
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:08,706
Well, I think I have 
just about enough...

68
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:11,475
I'll show her to her room. 
/ [Speaks German-goodnight.]

69
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:13,436
Goodnight. 
/ Goodnight.  Sleep tight.

70
00:05:13,436 --> 00:05:17,064
Nice meeting you. 
 She hates my guts.

71
00:05:17,064 --> 00:05:19,640
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

72
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,086
No, it's just that you...Well,
 you are somewhat of a...
of an acquired taste...

73
00:05:24,086 --> 00:05:26,974
Like sushi.

74
00:05:26,974 --> 00:05:32,308
Sushi.  Leave it to the Japanese
 to invent a restaurant where 
you don't have to cook.

75
00:05:32,308 --> 00:05:35,575
And we wonder why we're behind.

76
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,841
You're looking very fit, Nilesy.

77
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:43,384
Oh, Clara, then you
 do remember me.

78
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,747
How could I forget you.

79
00:05:45,747 --> 00:05:48,429
The butler's son,

80
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:52,212
a callow youth, 
just beginning in service?

81
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:55,933
And you, the experienced
 older woman.

82
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,278
I was all of twenty-two.

83
00:05:58,278 --> 00:06:00,525
Okay, thirty-two.

84
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,459
And yet I learned 
so much from you.

85
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:06,495
Let's review.

86
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,605
A little fluff, a little tease,
 and you look just like...

87
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:22,947
my mother.

88
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:28,338
I was hoping for Michele Pfiefer. 
/ Yeah, so was my mother.

89
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:32,007
Brighton, you lost all your checkers. 
 You always lose everything.

90
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:34,858
Not everything.  
I'm still stuck with you.

91
00:06:34,858 --> 00:06:36,501
Oh, shut-up. 
/ You shut-up.

92
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:39,419
Shut-up, Brighton. 
/ Will you all shut-up?

93
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:42,875
Here, use the cookies.  
That way you can eat your winnings.

94
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,702
But all the cookies are black.

95
00:06:44,702 --> 00:06:48,323
What?  All right, here.  
Now they're not.

96
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:52,530
Now, what color polish for
 your nails, Miss Pfiefer?

97
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:56,440
Little girls should not paint 
the face or the fingers.

98
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,361
We do not want to look like show... 
/ Oh, hello, Nanny Mueller.

99
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:03,286
Well, our little regular
 Hogan Hero.

100
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:08,801
He's great with impressions. 
 He does me, too.  Do me, do me.

101
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:10,811
Oy.

102
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:14,770
We do not do our hair in the kitchen.

103
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,921
And we do not belong on
 the counter.  We are not a teapot.

104
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:23,871
Sometimes I am.  This is
 my handle, this is my spout.

105
00:07:24,768 --> 00:07:27,264
That's an American thing.

106
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:31,015
Brighton, are you eating 
sweets between meals?

107
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:33,582
I have to.  I jumped her.

108
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:36,285
Miss Fine, you allow this?

109
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:40,173
I don't make the rules.  
If he jumped her, he jumped her.

110
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:42,852
Proper children don't
 play with their food.

111
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:46,208
Then I better go get the
 tater-tots out of my toy box.

112
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:49,791
He reminds me of his father
 at this age.

113
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,702
We sent him away
 to boarding school.

114
00:07:52,702 --> 00:07:56,433
Knocked that smart aleck
 shtick right out of him.

115
00:07:56,914 --> 00:07:59,862
Oh, boarding school?  
Poor Mister Sheffield.

116
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:02,652
I couldn't make it through
 one night of sleep-away camp.

117
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:04,981
I mean, what kind of 
a sadist puts a bunch of kids

118
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:08,993
into a tent after feeding 
them franks and beans?

119
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:12,223
The bears didn't know what hit 'em.

120
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:16,958
All right, fine.  Goodbye.

121
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,758
My mother will not listen 
to reason.

122
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:22,670
She's taking a trip to the Orient 
and every time she travels alone

123
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,601
she picks up some gigolo who 
spends all of her money.

124
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:29,892
Oh, I can see why you're concerned. 
/ Darn right.  It's my inheritance.

125
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:33,057
Excuse me.

126
00:08:33,057 --> 00:08:35,427
Hello.  Yeah, just a moment. 
 C.C.?

127
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:37,255
Is it my mother, B.B.?
 / Sister.

128
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:39,196
D.D.!

129
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,117
They save a fortune in engraving.

130
00:08:43,117 --> 00:08:47,954
Uh, Mister Sheffield, you got a minute?
  I really wanna talk to you 
about your Nanny Mueller.

131
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:49,240
Is there a problem?

132
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,920
Well, it's just that it gets 
a little confusing for the kids

133
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,518
when I say one thing and she 
says another. / Such as?

134
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:59,648
Oh, you know, I say tomato, 
she says tomata. I say potato, she says...

135
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:01,604
Miss Fine...

136
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:03,989
Well, since you asked,

137
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:07,244
Maggie is upset because Nanny Mueller
 took away all her make-up.

138
00:09:07,244 --> 00:09:10,621
Which kind of upsets me because
 most of it was mine.

139
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:15,212
Well, she is only fourteen. 
/ And every time Brighton cracks a joke,

140
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:17,397
she's sending him off 
to boarding school.

141
00:09:17,397 --> 00:09:20,882
Which, if you ask me, at his age,
 could screw any kid up for life.

142
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:25,350
I was sent away to Eaton 
at precisely his age. / Uh-huh.

143
00:09:25,842 --> 00:09:28,650
Miss Fine, considering your 
limited experience in this field,

144
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,374
maybe you should take 
advantage of this visit.

145
00:09:31,374 --> 00:09:33,833
Pick up a few tips
 from an old pro.

146
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,311
Well, who is she, Arnold Palmer?

147
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:39,897
She happens to be a highly trained, 
highly skilled professional nanny,

148
00:09:39,897 --> 00:09:42,280
and has been for the last forty years.

149
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,362
Well, meanwhile she's scaring Gracie
 to death with those stories about that

150
00:09:46,362 --> 00:09:50,350
fat bear that can't even get through 
the doorway every time
 he has a decent meal.

151
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,387
Are you talking about Winnie 
the Pooh? / Yeah, him.

152
00:09:56,058 --> 00:10:01,700
And who in his right mind would call
 a boy Winnie, let alone the Pooh?

153
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,289
Most children love those stories.

154
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:08,362
Far be it for me to
 pooh-pooh the Pooh,

155
00:10:08,362 --> 00:10:11,532
but in case you haven't noticed, 
Gracie is not most children.

156
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:15,484
She likes a good thriller.  We're 
right in the middle of The Firm.

157
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:20,293
What's the matter, Nanny Fine?  
Nanny Mueller giving you 
a run for your money?

158
00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:23,278
You got a piece of parsley
 right over there.

159
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,569
For heaven's sake, I think
 Nanny Mueller is marvelous.

160
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:31,159
She reminds me of my nanny.  Bobo.

161
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:36,107
Bobo?  Oy, were all you blue bloods
 raised by nannies?

162
00:10:36,107 --> 00:10:38,785
What were your parents doing?

163
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:41,135
I don't really know.
 / I have no idea.

164
00:10:41,651 --> 00:10:44,825
Knock, knock.  
I got a surprise for you.

165
00:10:44,825 --> 00:10:46,241
Children!

166
00:10:53,308 --> 00:10:57,810
Well, if it isn't the Von Sap family.

167
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,425
I had a sailor suit just like that.

168
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:04,300
Parsley's over here now.

169
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,108
Fran, I can't go outside in this.
  Somebody'll kick my butt.

170
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:10,973
Sweetheart, I'd kick your butt.

171
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:12,432
Excuse me.

172
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,085
I mean, who does she think she
 is criticizing my kids?

173
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:28,398
They're happy, normal kids.  
Gracie, stop staring up at the sun.

174
00:11:28,398 --> 00:11:32,501
You know, last night I found 
Eduardo in bed with my sister.

175
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:34,620
Twenty years I've given that man.

176
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,837
[Speaks Spanish.]

177
00:11:36,837 --> 00:11:40,262
Lupey, Lupey, Lupey, we dealt with 
your problems last week.

178
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:44,106
Can I get a little support here?

179
00:11:44,106 --> 00:11:48,764
Meanwhile, that Mueller's got those
 kids dressed like Huey, Louie and Dewey.

180
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:51,611
And she's got the nerve to want
 me to wear a uniform.

181
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,783
Like I'd be caught dead 
in one of those.

182
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,230
Well, on you guys it looks great.

183
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,101
And I guess those hairy legs are
 a big hit in Europe, too.

184
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:07,930
Francine, don't forget
 the cardinal rule.

185
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,591
Never come between a man and 
his nanny.  You won't win.

186
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:13,632
You're right, you're right.

187
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,069
I seen it happen 
a hundred times.

188
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,472
She's after your job. 
/ It happened to me.

189
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:23,805
She flew in on a broomstick and 
just tried to take over.  But I
 wouldn't put up with it,

190
00:12:23,805 --> 00:12:26,889
and I went straight to Mister
 MacKenzie and told him so.

191
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:31,563
But you don't work for 
the MacKenzies. / Exactly.

192
00:12:42,214 --> 00:12:47,280
Since I retired, I cover 
the world visiting my children.

193
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,288
But I saved the best for last.

194
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:52,442
Oh, Nanny Mueller, please.

195
00:12:52,442 --> 00:12:54,630
Do go on.

196
00:12:55,433 --> 00:13:00,016
So, Maxwell was always your favorite? 
/ He was my chubby little cherub.

197
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:05,480
He used to roll around the garden
 without a stitch of clothing on,
 run, run, run.

198
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,025
Nanny Mueller... 
/ Well, you did.

199
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:13,776
He had the cutest bottom.  
Like two shiny little cling peaches.

200
00:13:15,613 --> 00:13:19,059
Well, that's more than I've ever
 wanted to know about Dad.

201
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:24,081
I am so glad I stayed for dinner. 
 There's something positively 
delightful about this evening.

202
00:13:24,081 --> 00:13:27,189
I can't quite put my finger on it.
 / Where's Miss Fine?

203
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:29,231
Oh, that's it.

204
00:13:35,605 --> 00:13:37,864
I'm sorry I'm late,

205
00:13:37,864 --> 00:13:40,795
but it's hell finding
 white shoes in winter.

206
00:13:40,795 --> 00:13:44,124
The hat was easy, 
Howard Johnson's.

207
00:13:45,638 --> 00:13:48,515
Children, it's not polite to stare.

208
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:51,385
Miss Fine, you, 
you look like a...a...

209
00:13:51,385 --> 00:13:55,722
nanny. / Yes, that's it.  
I just didn't put it together.

210
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:58,395
I don't want to disturb you. 
I just thought I'd take my dinner

211
00:13:58,395 --> 00:14:01,372
and eat it in the kitchen, 
where I belong.

212
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:03,475
Miss Fine, please don't be so silly.  
Come and join us.

213
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,707
No, no.  The kitchen is where
 a proper nanny eats.

214
00:14:06,707 --> 00:14:10,988
Maggie, shut your mouth.  
We are not a Pez dispenser.

215
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:17,680
Nanny Mueller, it's amazing what
 you've done with Miss Fine.

216
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,282
Oh, that's nothing.  I had a Schnauzer
 once that gave me more trouble.

217
00:14:23,282 --> 00:14:25,844
Nanny, are you comparing
 Miss Fine to a dog?

218
00:14:25,844 --> 00:14:29,504
Not at all.  Schnauzer
 had a pedigree.

219
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,354
Don't mind me. 
 I just need a little salt.

220
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:39,223
Just a pinch.  I'll leave 
the shaker, on the table,

221
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:41,863
with the family, 
in the dining room.

222
00:14:41,863 --> 00:14:44,345
You got a little...

223
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:55,504
In my own little corner, in my own 
little chair, I can... / Miss fine.

224
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:58,343
Yes, Mister Sheffield, sir?

225
00:14:58,343 --> 00:15:02,015
Take off that uniform.
 / Oh, Mister Sheffield...

226
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:06,347
Why are you wearing this ridiculous
 get-up and acting in this ridiculous way?

227
00:15:06,347 --> 00:15:08,613
I'm just trying to be 
the proper nanny.

228
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:13,117
But if I wanted a proper nanny,
 I never would have hired you. / Thanks.

229
00:15:13,117 --> 00:15:16,297
You know what I mean.  You're,
 you're unconventional.

230
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:21,522
You have no professional training. 
 You look ludicrous in that uniform.

231
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:27,140
When do we get to the good part?
 / But despite the gaps in your resume,

232
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,610
the children adore you. 
 You make them very happy.

233
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,813
You make us all very happy.

234
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:37,780
I try.  So does that mean 
my job's not in jeopardy?

235
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:43,765
No more than usual.
 / Oh, I'm gonna give that Lupey such a zap.

236
00:15:44,238 --> 00:15:51,140
Miss...Nanny Mueller has turned 
this household upside down. 
 What am I gonna do?

237
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,967
Well, this is just off 
the top of my head,

238
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:56,342
but why don't we run
 this up a flagpole?

239
00:15:56,342 --> 00:15:58,746
Tell her to leave.

240
00:15:58,746 --> 00:16:03,060
I can't just turn her out.
  She raised me for heaven sakes!

241
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,791
I feel so guilty.  
Oh, you wouldn't understand.

242
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:11,326
I wouldn't understand guilt?
  My people invented it,

243
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:15,574
but we made up for it with the Salt
 vaccine and Streissand.

244
00:16:16,277 --> 00:16:18,827
Please. 
 I suppose you're right.

245
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:22,188
I should just
 tell her to go.

246
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:26,744
Unless...Do you really
 think she's that bad?

247
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:29,135
Did you see The Hand 
That Rocked The Cradle?

248
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:31,554
She was the technical advisor.

249
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:36,187
What's that?
 / Niles.

250
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:40,027
Nanny Mueller.

251
00:16:40,027 --> 00:16:42,194
Niles and Nanny Mueller...

252
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:58,553
A little custard 
pudding, Clara?

253
00:16:58,553 --> 00:17:01,898
Why not?  We've earned it.

254
00:17:02,403 --> 00:17:05,317
Niles, you... 
/ Oh, Clara...

255
00:17:05,895 --> 00:17:07,661
I can't believe it.

256
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:11,819
Niles?  Now we know what they
 meant by 'the butler did it.'

257
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:14,082
Nanny Mueller having, having...

258
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:15,287
Pudding.

259
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:17,243
And with Niles.

260
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:22,080
Yeah, well, she's a big girl.  
I'm sure she's had plenty 
of pudding with plenty of people.

261
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,549
Oh, please, I can't
 think of her like that.

262
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:26,298
I know.  It's like thinking
 about your parents having sex.

263
00:17:26,298 --> 00:17:28,949
Thank God mine never did.

264
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:39,623
Niles, coffee. 
/ Oh, thank you, sir.

265
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:42,086
I could use a cup.

266
00:17:42,523 --> 00:17:44,221
Oh, sorry.

267
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:48,909
Oh, good morning, everyone.
 / Morning.

268
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:51,501
Niles. / Nanny Mueller. 
 How did you sleep?

269
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:55,113
Like a little baby.  And you?
 / Quite well.

270
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:58,792
I think we all slept very well.
 / Actually, I didn't.

271
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:01,877
I kept hearing things that go
 bump in the night.

272
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:07,828
Thank you, Niles.
  I'm famished.

273
00:18:07,828 --> 00:18:10,335
The woman is insatiable.

274
00:18:10,335 --> 00:18:14,536
I see you're back at table,
 and out of uniform, Miss Fine.

275
00:18:14,536 --> 00:18:18,837
Maxwell, you might want 
a word with her.

276
00:18:18,837 --> 00:18:22,992
I think he wants a word with you.  
Mister Sheffield.

277
00:18:22,992 --> 00:18:24,463
Maxwell.

278
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:28,357
Yes, well, Nanny...

279
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,977
your visit has been wonderful, 
but like all good things...

280
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:35,490
Oh, yes, Maxwell,
 I never been so happy

281
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,927
since the day that you fell 
in the duck pond.  I pull you out,

282
00:18:39,927 --> 00:18:43,705
I breathe life back into
 your little limp body.

283
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:47,315
Oh...Now what you
 want to tell me?

284
00:18:47,741 --> 00:18:50,480
Oh, uh, look 
at the time.

285
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,134
I've got a tennis game. 
 Excuse me.

286
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:57,851
Oh, Mister Sheffield, 
you forgot your balls.

287
00:19:04,354 --> 00:19:05,497
Miss Fine...

288
00:19:05,497 --> 00:19:07,430
That's Nanny Fine.

289
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,718
That is a title that 
must be earned.

290
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:13,873
All right, maybe I haven't been 
a nanny as long as you.

291
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:17,290
But in case you haven't noticed,
 Mister Sheffield is all grown up.

292
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,702
He doesn't need
 a nanny anymore.

293
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:23,243
I'm the nanny here now, 
these are my kids,

294
00:19:23,243 --> 00:19:27,277
and well, it's time
for you to go.

295
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:32,208
You might think they're your kids,
 but they're not.

296
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:36,466
You'll find out,
 if you last as long as I have.

297
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,212
Kids grow up,
 go on their way.

298
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:43,406
You go on to another family,
 and you love them, too.

299
00:19:43,406 --> 00:19:49,367
'Cause you can't help it. 
 And on and on until one day

300
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:53,565
you find yourself with
 a lifetime of love to give

301
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:56,511
and no one to take it.

302
00:19:56,511 --> 00:19:59,445
Oh, Nanny Mueller, oh...

303
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:02,663
Nanny?  Nanny Mueller...

304
00:20:02,663 --> 00:20:04,363
Maxwell?

305
00:20:04,363 --> 00:20:07,544
Clara, as you can see, 
I'm all grown up now.

306
00:20:07,544 --> 00:20:11,283
My children have a nanny, and
 I think it's time for you to go.

307
00:20:11,283 --> 00:20:14,607
Don't you dare talk to
 your nanny like that.

308
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:16,154
What? 
/ Apologize.

309
00:20:16,154 --> 00:20:20,143
But, but...
/ You heard me.  Apologize...sir.

310
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,922
I'm, I'm sorry, Nanny.

311
00:20:24,642 --> 00:20:26,859
I forgive you,
 Maxwell.

312
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:30,351
Nanny knows you've been 
under a lot of strain.

313
00:20:30,351 --> 00:20:33,487
Yes.  Yes.  A lot of strain.

314
00:20:33,487 --> 00:20:37,071
I, I, that's it.  I've been 
under a lot of strain.

315
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:42,054
Kids.  We nannies have got to
 stick together.  We're like sisters.

316
00:20:42,054 --> 00:20:46,032
Then I can stay?

317
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:49,545
Not on your life.

318
00:20:54,447 --> 00:20:56,387
Goodbye, children.

319
00:20:56,387 --> 00:20:58,851
Oh, take good care of 
your father.

320
00:20:58,851 --> 00:21:01,220
Okay.

321
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,271
Maxwell...

322
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,194
Goodbye, Nanny.

323
00:21:08,194 --> 00:21:09,923
Oh, oh...

324
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:16,557
Goodbye, Niles. 
/ It's been a pleasure having you.

325
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:20,368
Children, see if you can 
find Miss Fine, would you?

326
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:22,533
Here I am, here I am.

327
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:26,089
Do you think I'd let her 
go without saying goodbye?

328
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:29,092
What have you done 
to your uniform?

329
00:21:29,092 --> 00:21:32,436
You like? 
/ I love.  Wonderbar.

330
00:21:32,436 --> 00:21:36,646
You make one for me in my size,
 six.  Okay, twelve.

331
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:39,609
All your bags are in the car,
 Nanny Mueller.

332
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:42,688
We'll just swing around and pick-up Mother 
and then the two of you will be off.

333
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:46,382
Oh, I'm so excited.  
I've always wanted to see Japan.

334
00:21:46,382 --> 00:21:50,509
And I have you to thank for that, 
Miss...Nanny Fine.

335
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:55,023
Oh, well you just have a good time. 
 And watch out for those gigolos.

336
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,347
Or maybe they should watch 
out for you.

337
00:21:57,347 --> 00:22:01,814
Oh, I take good care of
 my little C.C.'s mommy.

338
00:22:01,814 --> 00:22:03,601
I love you, Nanny Mueller.

339
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:07,573
Oh, come now.  You're really
 too much, sweetheart.

340
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:09,159
Get up, up.

341
00:22:12,127 --> 00:22:13,851
[Speaks German.]

342
00:22:13,851 --> 00:22:15,336
Bye, Nanny. / Bye...

343
00:22:15,336 --> 00:22:16,845
Goodbye, Nanny Mueller.

344
00:22:17,949 --> 00:22:22,293
Wonderful idea of yours putting
 Nanny Mueller together with C.C.'s mother.

345
00:22:22,293 --> 00:22:25,618
Look, I want Nanny Mueller 
to have a life, just not mine.

346
00:22:25,618 --> 00:22:27,967
Oh, let me just get out of
 this uniform.

347
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:29,406
Oh, no rush.

348
00:22:29,406 --> 00:22:32,954
Oh, Mister Sheffield.
