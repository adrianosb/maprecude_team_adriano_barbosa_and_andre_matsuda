1
00:00:03,021 --> 00:00:07,943
I'm going to miss you too, sweetie,
but it's the first day of school.

2
00:00:07,943 --> 00:00:11,590
They're going back to school, huh.
Going back to school, huh.

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,135
Going back to school, huh,
going back to school, huh.

4
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:18,765
Going back to school...
/ Oh, Niles, this sandwich feels a little stale.

5
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:22,789
Well, I made them in June in
anticipation of this blessed event.

6
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:26,903
Fran?  Hey, Fran.
/ Hi, honey.  What?  What?

7
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:30,917
How do I look? / Gorgeous, always.
Oh, wait.  Oh, my God.

8
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:33,965
Look how tall you got.
I can hardly reach.

9
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:36,419
Oh, my God.  I got too tall?
What am I going to do?

10
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:41,440
Well, somebody's got to clean
the Statue of Liberty. / Shut up, Brighton.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,480
Honey, you're gorgeous, don't worry.

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,651
In high school they stopped
making fun of the tall girls.

13
00:00:45,651 --> 00:00:48,656
It's the girls with BO
that's gotta worry.

14
00:00:49,574 --> 00:00:55,113
Sorry I'm late.  I was on the phone with
my therapist.  I had the unicorn dream again last night.

15
00:00:55,113 --> 00:00:58,299
Now, these shrinks, they read
something into everything.

16
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:03,103
Honey, a unicorn is nothing more
than a big horse with a long...

17
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:06,057
if you need therapy,
I need to be committed.

18
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:08,874
All right, children,
the limo's waiting. Time to go.

19
00:01:08,874 --> 00:01:11,312
All right.  You heard your father.
/ Scram.

20
00:01:11,312 --> 00:01:12,740
Woops!

21
00:01:13,347 --> 00:01:17,590
First day of school already.
Summer just flew by.

22
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,612
Spoken by a man who did not
see the "Lion King" 257 times.

23
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,854
Home alone.  No more Pog.

24
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:21,981
No more Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,
and alas, no more Nintendo.

25
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:24,912
What happened to the Nintendo?

26
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:29,544
Well, I accidentally pounded it
repeatedly with a meat mallet.

27
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:34,211
Niles, you couldn't have thought
of that two months ago?

28
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:40,500
Oh, Niles, look, ESQUIRE came out
with their most eligible bachelor list.

29
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,331
Oh, they retired Jon Jon.

30
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,145
You know, no offense to Daryl,
but, if you recall,

31
00:02:48,145 --> 00:02:50,974
Caroline found happiness
with a Schlossberg.

32
00:02:50,974 --> 00:02:54,658
Jackie found happiness
with a Templesman.

33
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:58,596
Maybe Jon Jon should have stopped
by a few Hadassah meetings.

34
00:02:59,786 --> 00:03:02,039
Oh, look, Mr. Sheffield's
moved up to third place.

35
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,226
Oh, yeah, oh, say hello
to bachelor No. 3.

36
00:03:06,226 --> 00:03:08,211
Oh, not you too.
/ Why?

37
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:11,541
I've been bombarded all morning
with FAX's and telephone calls

38
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,605
women who want to date me, women
who want to have my children.

39
00:03:14,605 --> 00:03:19,091
And this one wants to ...
oh, good God!

40
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:22,154
I'll follow-up on that one, sir.

41
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,839
Oh, Mr. Sheffield,
I think it's an honor.

42
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:32,382
Look, you're right behind Prince Edward
and the former Mayor Cotch.

43
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:34,626
I'll tell you, just my opinion,

44
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:39,499
but if those two ever met,
you could move straight up to No. 1.

45
00:03:40,461 --> 00:03:42,737
I don't want to be No. 1, Miss Fine.

46
00:03:42,737 --> 00:03:45,068
I don't want to be
on the damn list at all.

47
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:48,121
I'm a widower for God sakes,
not a bachelor.

48
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:50,253
And the difference would be?

49
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:53,451
Well, a bachelor makes you
think of dancing till dawn,

50
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:57,023
champagne for breakfast,
and black satin sheets.

51
00:03:57,023 --> 00:04:01,901
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, too bad
we never met in a past life.

52
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:03,980
Miss Fine, I'm quite
content with my life.

53
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,847
I have my family;
I have my work.

54
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:10,031
Well, you know what they say.
All work and no play makes a man ...

55
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:12,810
Rich enough to pay our salaries.
/ All right.

56
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,607
Play time's over.
Make some money. / Yeah.

57
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:17,870
Look, Miss Fine, I appreciate
your concern, I really do,

58
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,883
but I'm just not ready
to date yet.  All right.

59
00:04:20,883 --> 00:04:25,431
Oh, fine, I didn't bring it up.
I just came in for a fruit.

60
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:31,554
Oh, I'll tell you,
it just makes me so sad.

61
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:36,510
Here it is five years later, and he still
feels like he'd be cheating on his wife.

62
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,248
It's a classic widower syndrome.
/ Very astute, Miss Fine.  "Oprah"?

63
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:44,596
"Courtship of Eddie's Father."

64
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,840
You know, I never thought I'd say this,
but I kind of miss the kids.

65
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,065
Shut up, Brighton.
/ I'm over it.

66
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:56,323
We're home.
/ Hi.  How was your first day back?

67
00:04:56,323 --> 00:04:59,451
Oh, I love school.  They opened
a coffee shop across the street,

68
00:04:59,451 --> 00:05:02,137
and they only hired really
cute college guys.

69
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:06,438
And for this, your father
pays seven grand?

70
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:10,575
Was it directly across
the street or catty-corner.

71
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:16,690
Fran, I love second grade.  The conversations
on the monkey bars were so stimulating.

72
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:23,546
Oh...  Some of life's best moments are spent
hanging from your knees with your skirt over your head.

73
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:27,104
I hate junior high.
I'm never going back.

74
00:05:27,104 --> 00:05:31,495
Oh, now, don't panic.
It's just the first day.

75
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:34,868
Oh, he'll go back.
He will go back, won't he?

76
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,115
Well, if he doesn't,
we'll have to hire a tutor.

77
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:42,296
And then he'll be home
all the time. / Brighton ...

78
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:49,451
Brighton, honey, you want to
talk about it? / No.

79
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:51,122
Okay ...

80
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:59,422
On the other hand, I think I'd feel too
guilty cashing my paycheck this week.

81
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:04,028
Come on, B, I'm your nanny.
You can talk to me about anything.

82
00:06:04,028 --> 00:06:07,951
Except computers, those things
throw me into a tailspin.

83
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,580
Never mind.  It's too embarrassing.

84
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:16,506
Honey, you're talking to a woman whose
underpants fell off in the middle of Bloomingdales.

85
00:06:17,618 --> 00:06:19,071
Really?  What did you do?

86
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:24,531
I kicked them down to the land
comb counter and kept on walking.

87
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:28,073
Well, there are just some things
a girl wouldn't understand.

88
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:31,383
I'm not a girl.
I'm a nanny.

89
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:34,334
Anything you say goes
no further than this room.

90
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:38,174
I'm like a priest.
Well, not exactly a priest

91
00:06:38,174 --> 00:06:41,104
because priests are celibate,
and I'm ...

92
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:43,855
actually, I could be a priest.

93
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:49,057
No, not with that Nehru collar.
I like a nice scooped neck, a "V,"

94
00:06:49,057 --> 00:06:52,008
off the shoulder's nice,
all good for me, but a Nehru, no ...

95
00:06:52,008 --> 00:06:56,350
All right, all right,
I'll tell you.

96
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,563
We were in the locker room after gym ...

97
00:07:00,563 --> 00:07:01,477
And?

98
00:07:01,477 --> 00:07:04,585
Fran, I'm smaller than everyone else.

99
00:07:04,987 --> 00:07:06,833
Smaller?  How?

100
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,653
Just forget it.
It's too humiliating.

101
00:07:09,943 --> 00:07:15,091
Well, what could be so humiliating
about being smaller in the locker room?

102
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:24,326
Mr. Sheffield, I'm sorry to bother
you, but we've got a problem.

103
00:07:24,326 --> 00:07:28,052
And boy, you are never going
to guess this one.

104
00:07:28,052 --> 00:07:30,710
Just make it short.
/ You ...

105
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:40,533
You guessed.

106
00:07:41,356 --> 00:07:43,785
Niles, do you need to
speak with me as well?

107
00:07:43,785 --> 00:07:49,409
Oh, no, sir.  I simply wanted to be
here in person for this one.

108
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:52,717
Brighten was in gym class,
and, well, when he looked around,

109
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:57,851
compared to all the other
boys, he is small.

110
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,679
Small?

111
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:04,513
You know, like in petite...

112
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:07,898
pequito...

113
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:11,632
Girkin.

114
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:18,649
Oh ...

115
00:08:19,772 --> 00:08:22,972
And the poor guy's really upset.
What are we going to do?

116
00:08:22,972 --> 00:08:28,373
Yes.  Cee Cee, would you excuse us.
I have to have a word with Miss Fine.

117
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:30,471
If I go, he goes.

118
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:32,244
Yes, of course.  Niles.

119
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:34,612
What did I do?

120
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:37,242
Niles ...

121
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:40,563
Well, now you've ruined
it for everybody.

122
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:44,540
So ...
/ So ...

123
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:50,017
Brighten, huh?  Are you sure?
But he has such big feet.

124
00:08:51,082 --> 00:08:54,521
I suppose I'll just have to sit him down
and have a man-to-man talk with him.

125
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:58,548
Either that or buy
him a really big car.

126
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:02,870
Brighten...
/ Yeah, Dad?

127
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,724
I think we should have
a little talk.

128
00:09:05,724 --> 00:09:08,405
I mean not a little talk.

129
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:13,262
Well, it might it might, start out
little, but get big later.

130
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:18,210
Not that a ... not that a big talk is
necessarily any better than a a little talk.

131
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,675
The size of the talk is
really not important.

132
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:24,811
Any questions so far?

133
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:27,458
Have you seen my Nintendo?

134
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:34,882
Val, can you put my hair
brush in your purse?

135
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:38,513
I can if you carry my Mace.
/ Put your Mace in your pocket.

136
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:40,497
I got my Totes rain hat in there.

137
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:45,765
Well, if you put on your Totes rain hat,
you're not going to need the Mace.

138
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:51,604
Oh, Val, look at him sitting
there alone like a dog.

139
00:09:51,604 --> 00:09:53,998
Yeah, meanwhile, we're going to
miss the No. 5 bus.

140
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:58,256
But how is it possible?  I mean
he's handsome; he's young ...

141
00:09:58,256 --> 00:10:02,944
all right, he's 42, but he's
a nice man, a good catch, true?

142
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:05,059
True.

143
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,272
Ladies, please, I am not
in the cone of silence.

144
00:10:10,272 --> 00:10:12,996
Val, your voice travels.

145
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:17,204
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, come with us.

146
00:10:17,204 --> 00:10:19,019
No, really.  It's,
it's very generous of you.

147
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,478
But I, I have a full
evening planned.

148
00:10:21,478 --> 00:10:24,782
It will give me a chance
to finish the book.

149
00:10:24,782 --> 00:10:27,638
Oh, Webster's, let me
know how it ends.

150
00:10:27,638 --> 00:10:30,377
Well, all right, then, I can
spend the evening with ...

151
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:34,322
Maggie!  We'll go to Rufflemeyers and ...

152
00:10:34,322 --> 00:10:38,414
... have great big sundaes with nuts
and bananas, what do you say?

153
00:10:38,414 --> 00:10:41,801
Well, it's kind of
the first day of school.

154
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:46,227
I was going to meet up with some kids
and have some actual fun. / Oh.

155
00:10:46,532 --> 00:10:47,491
Bye.

156
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,914
Come on, Mr. Sheffield,
come with us.

157
00:10:51,914 --> 00:10:54,286
It's supposed to be
a really great club.

158
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:57,410
No, I already told you,
I'm not ready to date.

159
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,801
What date?  We're just
three friends sharing a cab,

160
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:03,555
or in this case, your limo.

161
00:11:03,555 --> 00:11:07,619
What does he know from clubs?
/ Excuse me.

162
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:10,438
Studio 54, Anabells, Tramps,

163
00:11:10,438 --> 00:11:13,369
Maxwell Sheffield was there.

164
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:18,099
Oh, you hear that, Val?
He got down, he got funky.

165
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:20,869
Ladies, to the limo.

166
00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:23,385
But who's going to hit on us
if we're with a guy?

167
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:25,455
Oh, just let me
take care of that.

168
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:28,880
Oh, Mr. Sheffield,
I'm so happy that you're coming.

169
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,098
You're really going to have
a wonderful time.

170
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:36,329
Oh, just one last thing: You don't know us;
we've never seen you before,

171
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:39,647
and I might have to tell
a few people that you're gay.

172
00:11:48,772 --> 00:11:52,528
Oh, is this a great club or what?

173
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:55,475
We haven't been inside yet.
/ Oh, we never get inside.

174
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:57,780
You get inside?

175
00:11:58,562 --> 00:11:59,921
Val ...

176
00:12:00,265 --> 00:12:03,468
Oh, Fran, there's a cute guy over
there checking you out.

177
00:12:03,468 --> 00:12:06,062
Where?  Where?

178
00:12:06,297 --> 00:12:08,004
Oh, he is cute.

179
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:11,928
I think you're losing it.

180
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,588
I wonder why.

181
00:12:15,522 --> 00:12:17,758
Oh, sorry, forgot.

182
00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:20,156
Don't even know you.

183
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,517
Oh, my God, is that Alec Baldwin?

184
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:25,066
No, I think it's Billy.
Wait, I think it's Daniel.

185
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:27,298
Oh, it's Steven.

186
00:12:35,914 --> 00:12:37,398
Maxwell Sheffield?

187
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:38,585
Yes.

188
00:12:38,585 --> 00:12:40,823
Please, please, follow me.

189
00:12:40,823 --> 00:12:44,342
Oh, my God, we're getting in.
/ And you didn't want to bring him.

190
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:47,150
Excuse me.  Are they with you?

191
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:51,610
No, don't know them.
Never saw them.

192
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,342
Perfect strangers.
/ Mr. Sheffield ...

193
00:12:54,342 --> 00:12:57,450
Oh, and I might be gay ...

194
00:13:07,843 --> 00:13:10,769
Want a jelly donut? / Sure, why not?

195
00:13:11,243 --> 00:13:13,864
You know, I'm going to write
those people at Exxon a letter.

196
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:16,690
They do a beautiful restroom.

197
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,748
Whoever cleaned that toilet should be
sent straight to Prince Edward Sound.

198
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:28,166
Here he is.  Mr. Sheffield,
we're over here.

199
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:32,261
Fantastic club.  You can't even
move on this dance floor.

200
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:33,837
So what do the two of you think?

201
00:13:33,837 --> 00:13:37,409
It's like nothing we've
ever seen before. / Ever.

202
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:41,673
I met the most incredible woman.
/ Get out of here.  You met someone?

203
00:13:41,673 --> 00:13:44,538
Yeah.  Just, just wait here.
I want you to meet her.

204
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:46,423
Can you believe he met someone?

205
00:13:46,423 --> 00:13:49,765
I'm wearing the Wonder Bra,
and he gets lucky?

206
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:52,484
I wonder who she is.
/ Oh, you know, he's so naive.

207
00:13:52,484 --> 00:13:55,596
I just hope he doesn't come
walking out with Rue Paul.

208
00:13:56,699 --> 00:14:00,672
Val, Fran, this is Leslie.

209
00:14:02,835 --> 00:14:08,079
Love the coat. Ha, ha, ha.

210
00:14:13,428 --> 00:14:14,836
Oh, my God.

211
00:14:14,836 --> 00:14:17,021
He's a sprocket.

212
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:20,096
Niles, have my chauffeur bring
the limo around, would you?

213
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:22,475
I'm taking Leslie out to
a gallery opening in Soho,

214
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:26,195
then on to dinner
and dancing at Matches.

215
00:14:27,705 --> 00:14:31,800
The man's got a life, and I don't.
It's a world gone mad.

216
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:36,668
So what is the mystery woman like?
/ Well, she's got a lot of hair.

217
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:39,844
She wears a lot of makeup
and and very flashy clothes.

218
00:14:39,844 --> 00:14:43,479
All in all, I'd say it was
a very attractive package.

219
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,178
Oh, I'll get it.

220
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:47,597
Niles, you know, you don't have
to keep announcing that.

221
00:14:47,597 --> 00:14:50,781
It's your job.  Believe me,
no one's going to horn in on you.

222
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,573
Hello.

223
00:14:59,294 --> 00:15:00,352
What?

224
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:02,103
Nothing, ah ...

225
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:06,054
just stay right here until
I go get Miss Babcock.

226
00:15:09,595 --> 00:15:12,850
Mr. Sheffield, Leslie's here.

227
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,236
Take your time.

228
00:15:15,588 --> 00:15:18,157
Come on.  Come, come, come,
come, come, come, come.

229
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:21,911
Niles, what is so damn important?

230
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:23,106
Hi.

231
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:28,961
Good God, it's multiplying.

232
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:31,899
I'd like you to meet Miss Babcock.

233
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:36,009
This is Mr. Sheffield's
business partner.  This is Leslie.

234
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:38,993
I love your hair.  Who does your color?

235
00:15:38,993 --> 00:15:42,541
Oh, it's natural.

236
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:50,427
Well, I think it's very distasteful
of Maxwell to be dating so soon.

237
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:54,075
Isn't a decade the standard
period of mourning?

238
00:15:54,075 --> 00:15:56,858
Die and let's find out.

239
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:02,265
Some house, huh?

240
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:08,741
Boy, when I first came here from Queens,
I never thought that I'd ever have a house this big.

241
00:16:08,741 --> 00:16:11,817
Tell me about it.  When I left Brooklyn
and became a C.P.A.,

242
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:15,106
wouldn't you know I had (inaudible).

243
00:16:15,106 --> 00:16:17,874
Oh, I hear ya.

244
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:22,003
Niles, would you ice this and put it
in the limo? / Oh, certainly, sir.

245
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:23,839
That's a good man.
/ Oh, excuse me, sir.

246
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,888
If you don't mind my asking,

247
00:16:25,888 --> 00:16:29,173
doesn't Miss Leslie
remind you of someone?

248
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:34,386
Oh, so you noticed it too.
/ Well, it is rather obvious, sir.

249
00:16:34,386 --> 00:16:38,708
Yes, she is a dead ringer
for Connie Selica.

250
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:47,447
She ... she is pretty unique,
isn't she, Niles?

251
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:49,906
Whatever you say, sir.

252
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,960
Oh, oh, careful there, man.

253
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,962
Oh!  Thank you, sir, yes.  You see,
I should have used my oven mitt

254
00:16:54,962 --> 00:16:57,623
instead of this somewhat
inferior substitution.

255
00:16:57,623 --> 00:17:01,854
But I didn't realize I wanted my oven
mitt until I saw them together.

256
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,615
And then I understood that of course
my oven mitt is exactly what I wanted,

257
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:10,423
and goodness gracious it was
under any nose the entire time.

258
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,664
Good, glad you found it.

259
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:25,333
It's easy for you to get sale shoes.
You're a double "A" width.

260
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,810
No, I'm really a "B,"
but for 75 percent off,

261
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,568
I'll hold my toes like this.

262
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:34,469
Stop it.
/ You stop it.

263
00:17:35,495 --> 00:17:39,690
Leslie, darling, I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

264
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,053
I hope you two found something
to talk about. / Uh-huh ...

265
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:45,686
Well, shall we?
/ Sure.

266
00:17:45,686 --> 00:17:49,006
But I just can't sit backwards
in the limo. I get nauseous.

267
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:52,802
Oh, well, there's pepto
in the mini-bar. Smile.

268
00:17:54,534 --> 00:18:00,090
Oh, I forgot to put the thingie on.
Now they're going to have red eyes.

269
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,141
Oh, boy, are they
a great couple or what?

270
00:18:03,141 --> 00:18:06,610
Boy, if they're not met
to be together, who is?

271
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:11,098
Miss Fine, doesn't Miss Leslie
remind you of someone?

272
00:18:11,098 --> 00:18:15,202
What am I, a radish?  That hair,
those clothes, that voice.

273
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:18,350
She's a dead ringer for Audrey Hepburn.

274
00:18:26,698 --> 00:18:29,881
Ma, Shirley Bassie?  I don't know.

275
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:32,032
200, 220.

276
00:18:32,032 --> 00:18:34,505
She goes up and down.

277
00:18:35,891 --> 00:18:38,354
Hi, guys. / Oh, hi, honey.
How was school today?

278
00:18:38,354 --> 00:18:41,625
Great, lots of fun.
There is so much to learn.

279
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:46,167
Ma, I gotta go be a nanny.  Bye.

280
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,492
What the hell is wrong with him?

281
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:50,314
He seemed perfectly normal.

282
00:18:50,314 --> 00:18:53,528
I reiterate.  What the hell
is wrong with him?

283
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:56,292
Mr. Sheffield thinks their talk
went rather well.

284
00:18:56,292 --> 00:19:00,962
Oh, Mr. Sheffield thinks Cee Cee goes
horseback riding for the exercise.

285
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:09,065
Smell Brighten's gym shirt.

286
00:19:10,057 --> 00:19:11,995
I don't smell anything.
/ Exactly.

287
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:15,907
And if anyone knows what a sweaty
man smells like, it's me.

288
00:19:15,907 --> 00:19:19,773
Brighten did not go to gym class today.
/ Very impressive, Miss Fine.

289
00:19:19,773 --> 00:19:24,360
Well, you don't watch eight years of
"Murder She Wrote" without
walking away with something.

290
00:19:27,848 --> 00:19:34,974
Brighten Sheffield, you cut class today.
I am very disappointed in you, young man.

291
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:39,614
I just said that in case
the intercoms were on.

292
00:19:39,614 --> 00:19:42,828
Now, come on, you got a problem.
Let's talk about it.

293
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:44,758
I told you you couldn't understand.

294
00:19:44,758 --> 00:19:49,855
Honey, I wouldn't understand?
My home room was Mc Donalds.

295
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:53,530
Come on, let's deal with it.
/ How?

296
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:58,149
Even if I grow another foot, I'll still
be smaller than most of the guys.

297
00:20:01,855 --> 00:20:05,540
Another foot?  What kind of school is this?

298
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:09,414
In grade school I was the big shot.
Fifth graders feared me.

299
00:20:09,414 --> 00:20:14,161
Now in junior high, I'm a walking
wedgie waiting to happen.

300
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:20,874
Oh, now I'm getting the picture.

301
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:26,272
They're all bigger than you,
not bigger than you.

302
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:31,930
Honey, this I can handle.
Sweetie, you're only 12.

303
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:36,352
Most boys don't shoot up until
after their bar mitzvah.

304
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:38,437
But I'm not getting bar miktzvah.

305
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:42,149
Huh, I hope it still works.

306
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:46,599
Honey, if it's any consolation to you,
given time, this will no longer be a problem.

307
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:50,952
Some day you're going to be a senior,
and you're going to be bigger
than all the other kids,

308
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:54,776
and you'll remember how you felt today.
When you walk down the hallway,

309
00:20:54,776 --> 00:20:59,932
you'll see some puny seventh grader,
and you'll give him a little shove.

310
00:20:59,932 --> 00:21:01,678
Thanks, Fran.

311
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,266
Just one more thing:

312
00:21:03,266 --> 00:21:05,873
When you said, "This I can handle,"

313
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:08,169
what did you think I was talking about?

314
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:11,939
Oh, exactly what you said, that
you're shorter than everyone else.

315
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:15,951
Although your father was
off on some wacko jag.

316
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:25,728
Looking for someone ...
/ Niles, you scared me.

317
00:21:25,728 --> 00:21:28,659
Put a bell around
your neck, would you?

318
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:30,503
You wanted him to have a life.

319
00:21:30,503 --> 00:21:33,669
Yeah, well, it's 11:00,
and he's got work tomorrow.

320
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:36,333
Well, you said he should have fun.

321
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,149
9:00 o'clock is having fun.

322
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:41,835
11:00 o'clock is already I don't need
another kid to take care of.

323
00:21:42,587 --> 00:21:46,098
And there's absolutely no one
else she reminds you of?

324
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:51,145
Oh, here he comes.
Stop yacking and act natural...

325
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:55,401
Niles, who is it?
/ Oddly enough, it's Mr. Sheffield.

326
00:21:56,356 --> 00:22:00,697
Oh, back so soon.
Did you have a good time?

327
00:22:00,697 --> 00:22:05,438
Well, you know, pleasant enough.
/ Oh, you didn't like her?

328
00:22:05,438 --> 00:22:10,026
Gee, I thought her charm was
only exceeded by her beauty.

329
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:12,766
Well, she had a certain
way about her.

330
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:17,593
There was just something missing.
/ Humm ...

331
00:22:17,593 --> 00:22:20,362
Like ordering champagne and
getting ginger ale.

332
00:22:20,362 --> 00:22:24,631
You know, they look alike but
don't make you feel the same.

333
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:28,913
Too bad.  She was going to fix
me up with her boss ...

334
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:32,390
English, handsome, rich.

335
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:36,231
All right, he's got a couple of kids,
but I could learn to live with that.

336
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:40,408
Well, maybe next time.  But I do
want to thank you, Miss Fine.

337
00:22:40,408 --> 00:22:43,808
For what? / Well, for getting
me out in the world.

338
00:22:43,808 --> 00:22:47,487
I mean Leslie may not be the one,
but, well, at least you made me realize

339
00:22:47,487 --> 00:22:51,223
that perhaps I don't have to live
the rest of of my life alone.

340
00:22:51,223 --> 00:22:54,542
Oh, good night, Mr. Sheffield.
/ Pleasant dreams, Miss Fine.

341
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:59,511
Yeah, well, if I'm lucky, I'll have
that one about the unicorn.

342
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:12,169
I don't smell anything.
/ Exactly,

343
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:15,866
now if there's one thing I know,
it's what a smelly man ...

344
00:23:19,306 --> 00:23:20,619
woopsie.

345
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:24,023
If anyone knows what
a swelly man smells ...

346
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:28,813
I'm sorry.
