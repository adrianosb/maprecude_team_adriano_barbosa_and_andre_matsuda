1
00:00:09,282 --> 00:00:10,807
Niles!

2
00:00:11,323 --> 00:00:14,416
Uh-oh. *************

3
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:17,133
Damn blasted bloody pipes!

4
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:19,846
I'm selling the house. 
 We're moving back to England.

5
00:00:19,846 --> 00:00:22,532
And he's taking
 it very well.

6
00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:25,924
And I supposed
 there's no tea.

7
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:29,298
Here, suck on this...

8
00:00:29,298 --> 00:00:30,497
sir.

9
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:34,150
Oh, Daddy, I'm disgusting. 
 I can't go out in public like this.

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,939
That's never
 stopped you before.

11
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:38,867
Good morning, everyone.

12
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:41,838
Miss Fine, do you have water 
in your bathroom? / No.

13
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:44,076
Well, then how could you
 possibly look like that?

14
00:00:44,076 --> 00:00:49,312
Believe me, it wasn't easy.  
I went through my entire 
supply of moist towelettes.

15
00:00:49,312 --> 00:00:51,769
And I laughed at my mother.

16
00:00:52,555 --> 00:00:55,656
Niles, did you call a plumber?
 / Yeah, I beeped him, sir,

17
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:59,316
but his yacht has gone
 into international waters.

18
00:00:59,316 --> 00:01:00,830
Well, did you look
 for someone else?

19
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:05,133
No.  I've been leafing through 
the yellow pages for origami supplies.

20
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,793
Oh, if you need a plumber,
 I got a second cousin...

21
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:09,962
No, I'd rather wait for rain.

22
00:01:09,962 --> 00:01:13,880
Are you still holding a grudge 
because of my Uncle Aaron,
 the electrician.

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,904
Hmm?  Why should I?  
My eyebrows have almost grown back.

24
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:21,979
Hey, a lot of women will pay
 good money for that effect.

25
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:24,703
It's difficult to get 
someone on the weekend, sir.

26
00:01:24,703 --> 00:01:30,588
"Well, cousin Irving is 
on call twenty-four hours a day."

27
00:01:30,588 --> 00:01:33,256
Miss Fine, this is an old house 
with very delicate pipes.

28
00:01:33,256 --> 00:01:37,243
Hey, my Aunt Ida would let any guy 
in a white coat remove her gallstones,

29
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:41,297
but only Irving could touch
 her toilets.

30
00:01:41,657 --> 00:01:47,820
Against every fiber of my body, 
contrary to every belief I hold dear,

31
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,478
you can hire your cousin.  
But if anything goes wrong...

32
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,167
Oh, would you trust me?  
Irving is a legend, believe me.

33
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:59,850
Before he set-up shop,
 they didn't call it Flushing.

34
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:57,411
Dad, why can't I go? 
 It's just a party.
  Give me one good reason.

35
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:01,777
I'll give you sixteen. Eight boys
 and their grubby little hands.

36
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:06,194
That's not fair.
 / Shh!  This is a very important call.

37
00:03:06,194 --> 00:03:10,084
Miss Growly, can you do 
a pedicure at four?

38
00:03:10,084 --> 00:03:13,141
Margaret, case closed. 
/ Fine.  I won't have a life.

39
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:15,710
I'll end up old
 and alone like Fran...

40
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:19,255
Hi. 
/ Hi.

41
00:03:19,255 --> 00:03:22,832
Have you seen my Polygrip?

42
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:29,997
Fran, you've got to help me.
 / Huh?  Sorry.  I think I've
 lost my miracle ear.

43
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:34,094
Miss Fine, please, I am trying to
 schedule my beauty appointments.

44
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:37,609
Oh, well, I hope
 it's not a toll call.

45
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:41,282
Now what is all this yelling about? 
 You're making me homesick.

46
00:03:41,282 --> 00:03:44,060
There's a party at Kimberly's
 and everybody's going but me.

47
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,452
Just look at this guest list 
I found by the telephone.

48
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:50,582
So, I know most of these kids.
  What's the problem?

49
00:03:50,582 --> 00:03:53,460
Well, they're all paired off,
 boys and girls, two by two.

50
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,629
It's like Noah's ark.

51
00:03:55,629 --> 00:04:01,217
Oh, your first make-out party.
  Who'd you get?

52
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:04,711
She's not getting anyone, 
and no one is getting her.

53
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,080
Did I say make-out? 
 I meant make-up.

54
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,985
Make-over.  Avon. 
 Mary Kay.

55
00:04:09,985 --> 00:04:14,952
Maybe they'll have Tupperware
 there.  No kissing, just burping.

56
00:04:15,685 --> 00:04:18,991
Are you done? / Unless you've
 got something to add.

57
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:22,707
Well, I do.  Maggie, you're
 too young.  You're not going.

58
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:25,118
I can't believe you.  
You never let me go anywhere.

59
00:04:25,118 --> 00:04:28,421
Not true.  Go to your room.

60
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:32,596
What's the matter? 
 All the convents are full?

61
00:04:32,596 --> 00:04:35,893
Miss Fine, she's too young
 for a kissing party.

62
00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:39,124
She's only fourteen years old.
 / She's gonna be fifteen.

63
00:04:39,124 --> 00:04:41,195
Oh well, you got 
an 'A' in math.

64
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:45,911
Look, I'm not letting her go to some 
Park Avenue apartment crawling with
 a bunch of lecherous young men.

65
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:49,606
Hmm, you wouldn't happen to have
 the address, would you?

66
00:04:49,863 --> 00:04:52,847
More pictures and resumes 
of showgirls, sir.

67
00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:55,695
Well, the audition's this afternoon. 
 These should have been here hours ago.

68
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,337
They were.

69
00:04:58,337 --> 00:05:03,979
I'd pay particular attention to Gigi,
 Lulu, and the one on the unicycle.

70
00:05:07,647 --> 00:05:11,175
How on earth does
 she keep from falling forward?

71
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:14,643
And even if she did, 
she'd bounce right back.

72
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:17,086
Oh, no, no, no.

73
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:21,747
These girls won't do.  
Look at that one.  Big hair,
 tight pants, red lips.

74
00:05:21,747 --> 00:05:24,191
Hmm, tramp!

75
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:27,589
Yeah, well, you're right, C.C., 
they're all tall, leggy and buxom.

76
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:30,810
And we specifically ordered
 short dumpy showgirls.

77
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,074
Oh, that reminds me 
of my Aunt Rosalyn.

78
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:35,751
All she ever wanted to do
 was to be a Rockette.

79
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:41,084
She made the height requirement. 
 It was the width that was the problem.

80
00:05:41,084 --> 00:05:43,877
I just can't get enough of 
these stories of your relatives.

81
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:47,615
Oh, tell me again about the one 
which ends with the plumbing getting fixed.

82
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:50,847
I'd like to shower and shave
 before these auditions.

83
00:05:50,847 --> 00:05:53,116
You are a bit scruffy.

84
00:05:53,116 --> 00:05:54,640
Common.

85
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,419
Brutish.

86
00:05:58,186 --> 00:06:01,068
Need a moist towelette?

87
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:12,133
Koenig Speedy Plumbing. 
 Sorry we're late.

88
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:13,382
Who are you?

89
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:15,820
I'm Tiffany, your second 
cousin, twice removed.

90
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,070
Oh, no way.  My cousin Tiffany's 
still in Pampers.

91
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,741
Good news, I'm potty-trained.

92
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:26,720
Which is more than 
I can say for him.

93
00:06:27,284 --> 00:06:28,908
Irving?

94
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:34,657
Fran, you got old.

95
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:36,785
Yeah, well I was a lot
 younger when I called you.

96
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:40,059
You were supposed to be here
 at nine-thirty. / We were.

97
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:43,151
It's a long way from the curb.

98
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:46,964
Oh, well don't lose your momentum. 
 The kitchen's down that way.
  Keep moving.

99
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:50,842
Hey, don't touch anything.  
You break it, you brought it.

100
00:06:50,842 --> 00:06:54,058
So this is nice.  Your grandfather
 is baby-sitting you?

101
00:06:54,058 --> 00:06:57,065
Vice-a-versa.  When we
 let him out alone,

102
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:59,518
he just keeps driving until
 he runs out of gas

103
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:01,860
and someone calls the number
 on the side of the van.

104
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,506
Oh, does that happen often?
 / Who knows?

105
00:07:04,506 --> 00:07:08,149
It's not our number. 
 He wrecked our van.

106
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:13,564
No, you may not look through the keyhole 
when your father is auditioning showgirls.

107
00:07:13,564 --> 00:07:16,643
Well why not? 
/ That's where I'll be.

108
00:07:17,194 --> 00:07:19,582
Brighton, c'mere.  
I want you to meet Tiffany.

109
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:20,983
Hi 
/ Hi.

110
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,892
Magic.

111
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:26,321
Well, why don't you two
 kids go up and play?

112
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,083
Mets fan?
 / Yankees.

113
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,536
Giants? 
/ Jets.

114
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:31,710
Geek.
 / Dork.

115
00:07:32,254 --> 00:07:35,078
Play nice!

116
00:07:35,886 --> 00:07:40,259
Whoa, this is 
some big house.

117
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,525
I hope he doesn't charge
 by the hour. / Oy...

118
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:53,980
Uh-oh. 
/ What's with the uh-oh?

119
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,746
I don't like to hear plumbers 
or hairdressers say uh-oh.

120
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:02,595
I forgot my wrench. / Well what were you
 doing down there so long without your tools?

121
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:05,604
That's my business.

122
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:08,793
Can I get you anything? 
 Juice?  Soda?

123
00:08:08,793 --> 00:08:10,970
Digitalis?

124
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,695
Oh, Niles, Mister Sheffield 
is gonna kill me.

125
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:18,609
Why do I have this compulsion to
 hire my relatives? / It's a sickness.

126
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:23,144
I know.  I should seek help.  Well,
 I'll call my Uncle Stanley.  He's a shrink.

127
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:27,064
You have no idea what 
you're talking about.

128
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:31,517
Yeah, you think just because I'm not rich 
and go to some fancy private school 
I don't know anything?

129
00:08:31,517 --> 00:08:35,266
I'm telling you, there were 
two Darrens. / She is crazy.

130
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:37,745
No, she's absolutely right.

131
00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:43,421
The first Darren died, the second 
Darren just came out of the closet.

132
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,684
Go live with a witch.

133
00:08:47,156 --> 00:08:48,934
******** 
/ Yeah, dream on.

134
00:08:48,934 --> 00:08:52,461
Hey, watch it, Richy Rich.  You welch 
on me, it's the last thing you'll ever do.

135
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:54,771
So sue me. 
/ It could happen.

136
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:57,438
Uncle Sidney!

137
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:03,078
I don't believe this.  Even 
the troll has a social life.

138
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:05,465
I know.  Here.

139
00:09:05,465 --> 00:09:07,866
Daddy can be such a pain. 
/ I know.

140
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:11,121
It's just a party.
 / I know.

141
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:14,455
Hey, I know a lot. 
 I should get a raise.

142
00:09:14,773 --> 00:09:19,752
Honey, try to be more understanding
 of your father. He just wants 
to protect you.

143
00:09:19,752 --> 00:09:22,696
Yeah, well he's impossible.  
He never lets me go anywhere.

144
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:26,784
I remember my mother didn't let me go
 to Amy Semoles sweet sixteen 
at the bowling alley.

145
00:09:26,784 --> 00:09:29,559
She had this thing about 
wearing other people's shoes.

146
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:35,360
She thought I would get polio. 
 Or was it Planter's warts?

147
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,346
Anyway, it was 
something with a 'p'.

148
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:40,792
And what does it
 have to do with me?

149
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,891
Give me a minute.

150
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:44,601
Oh, yeah.

151
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:48,549
You know, sometimes your parents 
sound like they're crazy,

152
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:53,012
but when you really 
think about it, they are.

153
00:09:53,711 --> 00:09:57,471
Oy, I'll go talk to your father.

154
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,880
Hey!

155
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:02,380
Well, the drain's clear.

156
00:10:10,737 --> 00:10:12,391
Wow!

157
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:14,681
How do you do?  Brighton 
Sheffield, producer's son.

158
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:18,118
Hi, Brighton.  And what do 
you want to be when you grow up?

159
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,130
A halter top.

160
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:26,095
Hello.  Hello.

161
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:27,755
Hi.  Hello.

162
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:31,177
Look, Fran, giant Barbi dolls.

163
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:33,387
Would you play with me?

164
00:10:33,387 --> 00:10:36,769
Oh, no, honey. 
 These toys are for boys.

165
00:10:38,494 --> 00:10:42,428
I have a four octave range,
 and I studied acting with Starr Adler.

166
00:10:42,428 --> 00:10:47,531
Very impressive. / I can also stand 
on my hands and do a full split.

167
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:52,445
You've got the part.
 / Oh, thank you, Mister Sheffield.

168
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:56,648
I can't wait to work for you. 
/ Oh God, I want your job.

169
00:10:57,862 --> 00:11:00,786
Thank you, Gigi,
 we'll call you.

170
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:05,957
Oh, watch it.  You could poke
 someone's eye out with those.

171
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:14,479
Well, look at the two of you, like
 a couple of cats outside a fish store.

172
00:11:14,813 --> 00:11:18,266
I would have thought you were 
more sophisticated than that.

173
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:20,717
No, not really.

174
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:23,477
Oh, Miss Fine, it's nothing
 to be ashamed of.

175
00:11:23,477 --> 00:11:27,114
The human body is a beautiful
 thing. / Hm-hmm.

176
00:11:27,114 --> 00:11:31,763
Well, I could have had that body, too,
 had I cashed in my Israeli bond.

177
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:35,230
Well don't look at me.  
I wanted to do "Twelve Angry Men".

178
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,957
Hmm... But they didn't
 wanna do you.

179
00:11:40,685 --> 00:11:44,571
Excuse me.  I think I'll see what
 needs dusting in the living room.

180
00:11:45,282 --> 00:11:49,064
Miss Fine, did you want something?
 / I wanna talk to you about Maggie.

181
00:11:49,064 --> 00:11:52,132
The answer is no.
 / But it's just a party.

182
00:11:52,132 --> 00:11:55,881
Amazingly enough, that cogent 
argument still hasn't convinced me.

183
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,347
Oh.  Well, give me a second
 and I'll think of something else.

184
00:11:58,347 --> 00:12:01,401
No.  Absolutely not.  
I forbid it.

185
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:03,619
Well, can I think 
it's a definite maybe?

186
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:06,429
I'll take care of my family, 
you take care of yours.

187
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:10,923
Now go tell  your Uncle Irving to hurry 
it up, or you'll be finished before he is.

188
00:12:10,923 --> 00:12:14,531
Do you want it fast or do you 
want it good? / I want it all.

189
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:18,267
You know, this grungy look
 is very cute on you.

190
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:20,557
Go.  Out.

191
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:25,187
Niles, bring me an aspirin. 
/ Sorry, sir, I've got my hands full.

192
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:30,651
Huh? 
/ Where's Irving?

193
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:33,319
Oh, the last time I saw him 
he was bounding up the stairs.

194
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:37,125
If you leave now you can probably 
catch him at the landing.

195
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,024
Pardon me.  Excuse me.

196
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,391
Irving?

197
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:46,691
Irving?  Irving, 
are you in here?  Oh...

198
00:12:48,613 --> 00:12:49,241
Oh...

199
00:12:52,668 --> 00:12:55,355
Oh my God!

200
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:58,065
How 'bout a little
 privacy here?

201
00:12:58,065 --> 00:13:01,621
Tiffany, I told you 
not to touch anything!

202
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:04,488
But you also said
 to play nice.

203
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:14,309
What were you kids thinking 
making out in there?

204
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:17,857
A minute ago you were at each other's
 throats, now you're just at each other?

205
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:20,809
What happened? 
/ Well, she hit me, then I pushed her.

206
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:24,507
One thing let to another. 
 You know how it is.

207
00:13:25,122 --> 00:13:27,828
The kid's cute so
 I kissed him.

208
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:31,571
Go ahead, tell me you haven't had 
the same thoughts about his old man.

209
00:13:31,571 --> 00:13:35,698
Just mind your own B.I. business. 
/ Fran, it was no big deal.

210
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:38,172
Maybe not to you, but you're
 gonna get me fired.

211
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:41,055
Your father has this big thing
 about his kids kissing.

212
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:44,388
I don't know why.  
They're very good at it.

213
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:46,672
Hey, what can I say?

214
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,302
Hey!  What are you doing?!

215
00:13:51,302 --> 00:13:55,011
You guys need to be hosed down,
 if only we had water.

216
00:13:55,698 --> 00:13:59,116
You, go to your room.  
Not you.

217
00:13:59,116 --> 00:14:03,439
You wanna get somebody hot, go light 
a fire under your grandfather's butt.

218
00:14:10,368 --> 00:14:12,337
Oh, Mister Sheffield's 
gonna kill me.

219
00:14:12,337 --> 00:14:14,985
He's gonna find some way 
to make it all my fault.

220
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:16,987
Just because the plumber 
is my cousin

221
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:20,432
and he brought her and 
I sent them up to play together.

222
00:14:20,432 --> 00:14:24,319
Oh, the twisted pathways 
of his mind.

223
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:28,855
What am I gonna do?  He nearly had 
a conniption when Maggie kissed
 that boy Eddie,

224
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:32,214
and Brighton is three years younger.
  Oh, I'm gonna be canned for sure.

225
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:34,559
Miss Fine, you spend so much
 time up this creek,

226
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,019
I should think by now
 you'd've brought a paddle.

227
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:41,470
Niles, if you're not part of the
 solution, you're part of the problem.

228
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,265
Well perhaps Master Brighton
 will keep his mouth shut.

229
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:47,511
If he could do that, I wouldn't
 be in this mess in the first place.

230
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,354
Hey, guess what.
 / What?  What?

231
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:51,899
Brighton kissed 
Tiffany in the shower.

232
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:55,810
Thank you, Hedda Hoppa. 
 Anymore bright ideas.

233
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,274
Well, perhaps you have a cousin
 who works for unemployment.

234
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:03,143
Miss Fine! / Oh, I can explain.  
You know, it's true.

235
00:15:03,143 --> 00:15:07,321
I did send them up to play with 
each other, but who knew 
they'd take it literally?

236
00:15:07,321 --> 00:15:11,081
What are you talking about?
 / You first.

237
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:14,899
There's still no water. 
/ Oh, you're mad about the water.

238
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:19,504
Did you hear that, Niles?
  He's mad about the water. / Yes.

239
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:23,825
Miss Fine, this is hardly cause 
for celebration.  I'm about 
to fire your cousin.

240
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:27,875
Oh, fire away.  Listen, a man's 
gotta do what a man's gotta do.

241
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,240
About the water.

242
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:33,685
You're taking this 
awfully well.

243
00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:36,908
She thought she was in trouble 
about Brighton.

244
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,412
Oops.

245
00:15:39,412 --> 00:15:41,109
What about Brighton?

246
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:44,887
Gotta go.  Got a play date.
  Bye. / Me, too.

247
00:15:44,887 --> 00:15:47,167
No, freeze!

248
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:49,875
Uh, Mister Sheffield,

249
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:54,814
as per your request to expedite
 the plumbing situation,

250
00:15:54,814 --> 00:15:58,767
I went upstairs to find
 cousin Irving, and um,

251
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:01,964
well, I found Brighton 
in the shower.

252
00:16:01,964 --> 00:16:05,093
He had water? 
/ He had Tiffany.

253
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:08,232
What?!

254
00:16:08,232 --> 00:16:10,836
Now look, I know you have this
 thing about your kids kissing,

255
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,946
but before you get all bent out of
 shape... / Brighton was kissing your cousin?

256
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:16,187
Oh, she's just a distant cousin. 
 Very distant.

257
00:16:16,187 --> 00:16:20,375
In fact, she's more like a close 
neighbor.  Not even close.  There was a fence.

258
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:24,775
And so Brighton's had his first kiss,
 huh?  And only eleven years old.

259
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:29,952
Well, you sound proud of that. 
/ Well, he beat his old man by two years.

260
00:16:29,952 --> 00:16:35,014
But, wait a minute.  When Maggie was over... 
/ Now would be a good time to stop talking.

261
00:16:35,014 --> 00:16:37,387
Oh.  Yeah.  You know,

262
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:40,261
you never think of 
that as an option.

263
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:45,805
Irving...

264
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,989
What's the matter? 
 Your watch stopped?

265
00:16:47,989 --> 00:16:50,739
No.  The date changed.

266
00:16:50,739 --> 00:16:53,326
Are you gonna be through with 
this before the battery wears out?

267
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:56,522
This bathroom is ready to go.
 / Oh, thank God.

268
00:16:56,522 --> 00:16:58,082
So we can take a shower?

269
00:16:58,082 --> 00:17:02,655
If it's you and me you're
 talking about, it's extra.

270
00:17:04,548 --> 00:17:08,154
Fran, did you hear that Brighton
 was kissing Tiffany in the shower?

271
00:17:08,154 --> 00:17:10,884
What is this, 
a slow news day?

272
00:17:10,884 --> 00:17:13,368
This stinks! I'm not allowed 
to go to a stupid party,

273
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:16,994
but daddy wants to throw Brighton
 a parade? / I know.  It's so unfair.

274
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,648
Oh, is this yours?

275
00:17:18,648 --> 00:17:21,184
No.  It's Gracie's.

276
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:24,460
Fran, what are
 we gonna do about it?

277
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,363
Honey, I told you, I'm working on him,
 but you know, men can't be rushed.

278
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:31,320
They're like chickens.  You 
cook 'em too fast, they get tough.

279
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,566
Whereas if you take your time
 with them, let 'em simmer,

280
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:36,787
then they fall apart 
in your hands.

281
00:17:36,787 --> 00:17:40,916
But the party's tonight. 
/ Oh.  Well, kiss it off.

282
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,473
Fran!

283
00:17:42,473 --> 00:17:45,796
Honey, I've been skating on thin 
ice with your father all day.

284
00:17:45,796 --> 00:17:49,067
Please don't push 
me through.

285
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:52,786
Aren't you the one who's always telling me
 that men and women should be treated equally?

286
00:17:52,786 --> 00:17:54,688
Well, that sounds like me.

287
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:57,690
Except that men should still 
open the door and pick up the check.

288
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,259
Yeah.  That's definitely me.

289
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:04,876
Okay, here, here, here.  
I'll go poke the chicken.

290
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:09,567
Mister Sheffield?

291
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:13,740
Mister Sheffield?  I told you kids...

292
00:18:16,238 --> 00:18:20,178
Oh, Mister Sheffield!

293
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,858
Oh, you're wearing your new 
soap on a rope that I gave you.

294
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:29,904
What?  What is it?

295
00:18:29,904 --> 00:18:33,028
I just... And he was... And I saw...

296
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:36,993
Miss Fine, you're hysterical. 
 Now don't make me slap you.

297
00:18:37,422 --> 00:18:40,864
I just saw Mister Sheffield
 naked.  It was horrible.

298
00:18:40,864 --> 00:18:43,862
Yes, I keep telling him
 to get to the gym.

299
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:48,600
I'm serious.  It's like 
seeing your father naked.

300
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,812
My mother should
 be so lucky.

301
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,407
Would you like a cigarette,
 Miss Fine?

302
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:56,100
Oh, he can't even stand to be
 seen without a tie.

303
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,433
Oh, this is gonna put him right
 over the edge.

304
00:18:58,433 --> 00:19:01,912
You know, when I first started in 
service, I walked in on the Queen Mum.

305
00:19:01,912 --> 00:19:04,776
In the shower?
 / On the throne.

306
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:08,370
He's not strong 
enough to handle this.

307
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,922
I don't care how many 
bulging muscles he's got.

308
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:13,590
Well, just promise 
me one thing. / What?

309
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,385
Let me tell
 Miss Babcock.

310
00:19:18,672 --> 00:19:21,207
There you go.  Now do I get some
 kind of guarantee with that?

311
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:24,299
Yeah, I guarantee I'll be back.

312
00:19:26,175 --> 00:19:28,405
Gramps, let's get 
a start on those stairs.

313
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:31,194
I wanna make 
it home before Letterman.

314
00:19:33,544 --> 00:19:35,731
You're leaving me?  
Just like that?

315
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:38,461
Don't cling.  
You're suffocating me.

316
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,761
We just met. / And it was nice 
while it lasted, but it's over.

317
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:45,349
Let's not drag this out.

318
00:19:47,422 --> 00:19:52,603
Dad, I'm no expert on this, 
but was I just dumped?

319
00:19:52,603 --> 00:19:54,291
Yes, son.

320
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:57,147
Welcome to the battle 
of the sexes.

321
00:19:57,147 --> 00:20:00,472
Where they sneak up on you, 
when you're most vulnerable,

322
00:20:00,472 --> 00:20:06,518
utterly humiliate you, and leave
 you trembling, exposed and naked.

323
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:12,832
Yeah, okay, but dumped or not,
 did I get to first base?

324
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:15,876
Well, yes. 
/ All right!

325
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:18,979
Mister Sheffield!

326
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,810
Uh, um, was, was there 
a paper this morning?

327
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,909
Yes.  You read it at breakfast. 
/ Oh...

328
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:34,738
Mister Sheffield, I have to 
see you a sec.

329
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:38,767
Oh, I think you've seen quite enough. 
/ Mister Sheffield, it's important.

330
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:41,965
All right, all right, but please,
 I beg of you just get to the point.

331
00:20:41,965 --> 00:20:45,737
No more long stories about 
your high school, family, pets.

332
00:20:45,737 --> 00:20:49,052
Okay, okay, I'll just stick
 to the bare facts.

333
00:20:49,052 --> 00:20:52,557
I'm sorry.  I mean, it's
 no big thing.  Oy...

334
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,243
This isn't going well. 
 Let me just cut to the chase.

335
00:20:58,243 --> 00:21:00,346
Yeah, that's okay.

336
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:04,755
I'm sorry I walked in on you,
 but you have nothing to be ashamed of.

337
00:21:04,755 --> 00:21:07,552
Didn't you say the human body 
is a beautiful thing?

338
00:21:07,552 --> 00:21:09,799
Oh now, Miss Fine, you can't
 go comparing me

339
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:13,474
looking at these girls for an audition, 
with you walking in on me in the shower.

340
00:21:13,474 --> 00:21:16,707
It's, it's entirely different. 
/ Yeah, I'm not selling tickets.

341
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:20,624
Although plenty of women would
 pay through the nose.

342
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:24,565
Miss Fine! 
/ I'm just kidding.

343
00:21:24,565 --> 00:21:29,290
I didn't see anything.  
Except for the double standard.

344
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,868
My double what? 
/ Your double standard.

345
00:21:31,868 --> 00:21:33,946
You have one set of 
rules for boys,

346
00:21:33,946 --> 00:21:38,429
and then a whole repressed Rapunzel
 thing happening for the girls.

347
00:21:38,762 --> 00:21:41,113
Are we back on this blasted party?!

348
00:21:41,113 --> 00:21:44,764
Look, all I'm saying is that you need 
to trust Maggie as much as Brighton,

349
00:21:44,764 --> 00:21:46,739
and knowing Brighton, 
even more so.

350
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:49,514
I trust Maggie.  
It's the boys I don't trust.

351
00:21:49,514 --> 00:21:52,811
Well, Maggie has to learn to 
handle fourteen year old boys,

352
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,259
so when she grows up, she can 
know how to handle full grown men.

353
00:21:56,259 --> 00:22:00,369
Who, when you think about it, 
are a lot like fourteen year old boys.

354
00:22:02,978 --> 00:22:07,033
You have a very good point. 
 How annoying.

355
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:09,870
Well, all right, she can go to the party,
 but she has to be back by ten o'clock.

356
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,438
Ten o'clock...

357
00:22:11,438 --> 00:22:14,499
is a good time to have a good
 time, but not too good a time.

358
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,482
Fine.  Thank you, thank you.  
Now back to work.

359
00:22:17,482 --> 00:22:20,826
Mister Sheffield, are you gonna 
look me in the eye again?

360
00:22:20,826 --> 00:22:24,047
Hmm?  I am looking you in the eye. 
/ Hm-hmm.

361
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:26,810
Look, Miss Fine, surely you can 
understand this whole episode

362
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,500
has been a little 
embarrassing for me.

363
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,238
Oh, don't be silly.
 It all happened so fast.

364
00:22:33,238 --> 00:22:36,386
I didn't see anything. 
/ Good.

365
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:38,932
You have nothing to be
 embarrassed about.

366
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:41,577
Believe me.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
