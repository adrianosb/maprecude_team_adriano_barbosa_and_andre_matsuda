1
00:00:04,585 --> 00:00:06,708
Introducing ... ing ... ing ... ing ...

2
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:09,190
number forty-four, four, four, four, four,

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,840
Brighton Sheffield ...
 field ... field ... field.

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:16,211
He's safe. 
 And the crowd goes wild!

5
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:24,434
My coach thinks 
I'm pretty good.

6
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:27,445
I just need work on catching
 and spitting ... ach ....

7
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:29,754
Don't even think about it.

8
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:34,356
Brighton, this is the athletic
 supporter you picked out?

9
00:00:34,356 --> 00:00:36,966
Who'd you buy it for, Mr. Ed?

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,228
He's a Sheffield. 
 He'll grow into it.

11
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:46,058
Is it me, or did someone just 
turn the heat on around here?

12
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:49,998
Miss Babcock, there's a gentleman 
on line three who claims to be your father,

13
00:00:49,998 --> 00:00:53,378
and I admire him for having
 the guts to admit it.

14
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,115
Yes, she's right here.

15
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:01,522
Hello, Father.

16
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:05,022
How nice.  Goodbye.

17
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:09,083
Oh ... another Hallmark moment.

18
00:01:09,476 --> 00:01:12,729
So, your father's here. 
 What's he like?

19
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:15,200
We're complete opposites. 
 We have nothing in common.

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,657
Oh, I can't wait to meet him.

21
00:01:17,657 --> 00:01:22,410
I'm far too busy, besides I saw him
 last year.  We had dinner and shared a cab.

22
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,238
Stay tuned for the Babcock
 Family Christmas Special.

23
00:01:26,238 --> 00:01:28,970
You gotta see him.  
It's like my mother always said ...

24
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,563
You can freeze anything? 
/ No.

25
00:01:31,563 --> 00:01:35,697
Why buy Sweet and Low when 
restaurants are giving it away? / No.

26
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:39,330
Seven cans of tuna fish count
 as one in the express line?

27
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,674
No.  My mother always said ... 
blood is thicker than water

28
00:01:42,674 --> 00:01:46,459
and you can wash 'em both off 
of plastic slip covers.

29
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:50,970
Miss Fein, what are you babbling about?
 / You have to make time for family.

30
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,295
Why don't you have him over for dinner?
  Niles can whip something up.

31
00:01:55,295 --> 00:01:57,445
I would like him to meet
 the man in my life.

32
00:01:57,445 --> 00:02:01,071
Oh, by all means,
 bring him along.

33
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:04,833
I'll blow him up and put him
 in his usual chair.

34
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:07,153
Put your fingerprints on one more crab 
puff and you'll find mine on your neck.

35
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:11,455
Boy, you're in a grumpy mood.  
What's the matter, your corns actin' up again?

36
00:03:11,455 --> 00:03:17,486
They're excruciating, inflamed, 
throbbing pustules, begging to burst.

37
00:03:17,486 --> 00:03:19,705
I'm glad they're not makin' wine.

38
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:22,790
Niles, we can't use this china. 
 The pattern is hideous.

39
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,504
That's not the pattern,
 it's your reflection.

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,089
If I'm going to see my father,
 everything has to be perfect.

41
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:31,283
He is demanding, critical, judgmental.

42
00:03:31,283 --> 00:03:34,236
You have no idea what it's like 
to be around someone like that.

43
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:36,909
Totally in the dark. 
/ Not a clue.

44
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:38,038
Maxwell?
 / Hm?

45
00:03:38,038 --> 00:03:40,492
You have little planes 
all over your tie? / So?

46
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:44,022
So, Dad's a Navy man. 
 Don't you have anything with boats?

47
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:46,041
Oh, never mind,
 I'll get it for you myself.

48
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:49,567
Any excuse to get
 in his drawers.

49
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:55,006
Niles, Gatorade alert. / Hey, I thought 
you were supposed to be at Little League.

50
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:57,749
I was. / Well, where are 
your grass stains?

51
00:03:57,749 --> 00:04:02,129
They don't grow grass on the bench. 
/ Oh, shut up, Olive Oil.

52
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:06,668
I played right field. 
/ Oh ... loser land.

53
00:04:06,668 --> 00:04:10,172
Hey, I played right field.

54
00:04:10,172 --> 00:04:11,775
Oh ....

55
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:15,499
Tell you what.  What do you say I get
 us a couple of box seats
 at opening day at Shea Stadium, huh?

56
00:04:15,499 --> 00:04:19,530
And you'll see how the pros do it. 
/ Hm, or at least the Mets.

57
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:23,700
Hello.

58
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:31,676
Kitten, you haven't aged a bit. 
/ Daddy, I'm over here.

59
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:35,444
And she has her mother's sense
 of humor.  None.

60
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:39,459
Well, call me crazy, 
but I think I like him.

61
00:04:40,869 --> 00:04:42,701
Stuey, you're a stitch.

62
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:48,384
So, finally, I had to slip the doorman
 a hundred dollars to give me his pants.

63
00:04:49,202 --> 00:04:52,166
Oh, my God.  That must
 have been embarrassing.

64
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:56,102
Talk about embarrassing.  My parents
 were once on "Let's Make A Deal."

65
00:04:56,102 --> 00:05:00,086
Nine hundred people knew it was door 
number one.  They had to pick the box.

66
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:03,863
P.S. Carol Merrill 
on a tricycle.

67
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,797
Well, if you want 
to talk embarrassing

68
00:05:08,797 --> 00:05:12,040
Ivana and I were down 
in Palm Beach, at Mara Lago,

69
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,769
and we locked ourselves out of
 the poolhouse.  There we were,

70
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:20,158
dripping wet with no towels!

71
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:26,275
We didn't even have espadrilles.

72
00:05:27,522 --> 00:05:30,300
So, Stewart, how long 
are you  here for?

73
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,428
Oh ... oh ....  
The gardener saw us, too.

74
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:38,891
Just long enough 
to do some business.

75
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:43,294
Did I mention that I bought a Picasso? 
/ Not since the salad.

76
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:50,593
I have to check out some new hotel properties 
and I'll meet with the foreign investors,

77
00:05:50,593 --> 00:05:54,398
and I suppose I have to show 
my face at this Streisand thing.

78
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:58,876
Barbra Joan Streisand?  Born April
 twenty-fourth, nineteen forty two,

79
00:05:58,876 --> 00:06:04,853
to Manny and Diana Steisand, of 
Four Fifty-Seven Schenectady Avenue, Brooklyn?

80
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:11,042
I take it you are a fan.

81
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:15,699
Oh, well, if you call turning 
your bedroom into a shrine ...

82
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,760
seeing all of her movies 
twenty-five times,

83
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:24,168
paying two hundred dollars for a piece of
 chewing gum from the bottom of Barbra's shoe ....

84
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:28,217
Is ... is that what that framed 
thing in your room is?

85
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:31,285
Oh, no.  That's the sour ball 
that Elliot Gould spit out,

86
00:06:31,285 --> 00:06:34,284
but he was married
 to her at the time.

87
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,383
I'd say she qualifies as a fan.
 / Hm-hm.

88
00:06:37,383 --> 00:06:40,784
I'm part of the consortium that's
 backing Barbra's tour.

89
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:44,312
Oh, you must be plotzing!

90
00:06:44,312 --> 00:06:47,505
Franny Fein, we don't plotz.

91
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:50,912
I'm with you, Daddy. 
 I find her singing irritating.

92
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:55,798
Ah!  An entire acre of Beth Shalom
 Cemetery just rolled over.

93
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:00,061
Well, it's her voice.  
It's so nasal.

94
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:03,346
Well, that's part of her charm.

95
00:07:03,346 --> 00:07:06,094
I didn't know that
 you disliked her, C.C.

96
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:09,561
Fran, would you like to go?

97
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,709
Oh ... I'm sorry. 
It's just too much for me.

98
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:26,206
I mean, the idea of finally
 seeing Barbra in person!

99
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:29,011
And our tickets are 
in the front row.

100
00:07:33,813 --> 00:07:37,688
Did you see her eyes roll back?
 That was so cool.

101
00:07:37,688 --> 00:07:41,782
Might I suggest a safety belt
 for the concert?

102
00:07:41,782 --> 00:07:44,724
There is one more thing, but ...

103
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:48,571
perhaps someone should hold onto her.

104
00:07:49,654 --> 00:07:53,066
I'm okay.  Give it to me straight.

105
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:55,722
We're going backstage.

106
00:07:56,616 --> 00:07:58,675
I'm fine.

107
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:03,355
You don't mind, do you, sweetheart? 
 I mean, since you hate her so much.

108
00:08:03,355 --> 00:08:06,467
Is he talking about Barbra or Fran?

109
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:10,010
No, please, go ahead.  Enjoy.

110
00:08:10,237 --> 00:08:12,106
Good.  Then it's settled.

111
00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:15,725
Now, my boy, what position
 do you play?

112
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:18,531
Well, see, it's not so much 
the position you play,

113
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,024
it's just that you're being 
part of the team.

114
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:23,396
Right field, huh? 
/ Yeah.

115
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:33,545
Poor thing.  She held on 
as long as she could.

116
00:08:39,273 --> 00:08:42,086
Yes.  All right.  Goodbye.

117
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:44,467
Niles, crack open the champagne!

118
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:48,862
The Theater Guild has finally invited me
 to speak at this year's Broadway symposium.

119
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,498
So Andrew Lloyd Weber is .... 
/ Out of town.

120
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,223
And Sondheim?
 / Busy.

121
00:08:53,223 --> 00:08:55,993
And Gower Champion?
 / Dead.

122
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:58,508
Ah, just have my gray suit 
ready by Saturday.

123
00:08:58,508 --> 00:09:00,283
Along with your baseball cap, sir?

124
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:04,323
What?  Oh, no. Oh, is that the day
 I promised to take Brighton to the ballgame?

125
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:06,663
Home run, sir.

126
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:08,942
Maxwell .... 
/ Oh, C.C., I've got a problem.

127
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:10,925
Well, I have problems of my own. 
 My father is missing.

128
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,946
He could be lying dead in
 a ditch somewhere for all I know.

129
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:16,512
No, he's not missing.  
He's out shopping with Miss Fein.

130
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:19,011
Oh, God, worse!

131
00:09:19,011 --> 00:09:20,960
C.C., you're not jealous, 
are you?

132
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,920
Me?  Ha!  Please!

133
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,978
It's just that she's taking time away 
from his work and time is money.

134
00:09:26,978 --> 00:09:30,369
And his money will
 someday be her money.

135
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,022
So naturally I'm concerned. 
/ Hm ....

136
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:40,684
Fran, this dress is going 
to be fabulous on you.

137
00:09:40,684 --> 00:09:44,395
Oh, Stu, you are like 
a fairy godfather.

138
00:09:44,395 --> 00:09:47,472
All I said was that I was
 in the mood for a Big Mac

139
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:50,842
and you got me a Bob Mackey.

140
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:54,996
Please don't mention it. 
 I love spoiling you.

141
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:57,081
Oh, well, if it gives you pleasure.

142
00:09:57,081 --> 00:10:01,702
Hey, I saw a pair of shoes at Bergdorf
 that would make you ecstatic.

143
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:04,072
I'll see you tonight. / Okay.

144
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:06,352
Have you told anyone that
 you're going to Streisand?

145
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:10,347
Well, just my mother, but she'll let
 the greater tri-state area know.

146
00:10:10,347 --> 00:10:13,179
Okay, see you later, Stu.
 / Goodbye, kitten.

147
00:10:13,517 --> 00:10:14,583
Kitten?

148
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:16,228
Oh ....

149
00:10:17,314 --> 00:10:21,510
Niles, I told you to cut the tops of
 your shoes out like my father does.

150
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,529
Only if I can have
 the powder blue socks

151
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:26,958
and Bermuda shorts to
 complete the look.

152
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,917
Oh, I had such a wonderful time with Stu.
  I feel just like Cinderella.

153
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:35,478
Hm, only in this case, 
there's an evil stepdaughter.

154
00:10:35,478 --> 00:10:39,431
Where the hell are they? 
 I can't believe they're not back yet.

155
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,303
Who?

156
00:10:41,303 --> 00:10:44,403
The swallows.  Capestrano.

157
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,547
Check on it, Niles.

158
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:52,771
Miss Babcock, you don't have a problem
 with me spending time with your father, do you?

159
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:55,524
No, Miss Fein, please. 
 I couldn't care less.

160
00:10:55,524 --> 00:11:01,327
Oh, good, because if they get married,
 Miss Fein will be your new Mummy.

161
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,929
Can you believe she fainted?

162
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:10,420
Oh, God, she's gonna get 
lipstick all over the couch.

163
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:13,669
Miss Babcock.  Miss Babcock.

164
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:15,686
Need some smelling salts?

165
00:11:15,686 --> 00:11:18,614
Brighton, quick,
 give me your sneaker.

166
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:21,017
Well, that woke her up.

167
00:11:21,017 --> 00:11:25,291
Oh, and just when 
I was about to slap her.

168
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:28,263
Oh, quit it, you two. 
 Don't tease ...

169
00:11:28,263 --> 00:11:31,291
my daughter.

170
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:37,420
Say, in the will, doesn't
 the daughter come after the wife?

171
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,232
I'm kidding.

172
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:45,546
If I were you, I'd be more concerned 
that the daughter would come after the nanny.

173
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:48,730
Oh, well, I know I'll be
 sleeping with one eye open.

174
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,989
Ah, Brighton, 
I have to talk to you.

175
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:53,971
Am I in trouble? 
/ No, I rather think I am.

176
00:11:53,971 --> 00:11:56,133
Great.  I have time for this.

177
00:11:56,133 --> 00:12:00,076
Well, you know how much I wanted to
 take you to this ballgame.

178
00:12:00,076 --> 00:12:02,702
Oh, you can't make it? 
 That's no problem.

179
00:12:02,702 --> 00:12:06,477
The thing is ... I'm afraid
 I'm just not gonna be able to make it.

180
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:08,225
Dad, it's like I said.  No problem.

181
00:12:08,225 --> 00:12:11,565
I know you're so desperately
 disappointed,

182
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,884
but you see, I ... I've been waiting years for 
the Theater Guild to invite me to speak and,

183
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:20,522
you see, they just called, so I .... 
/ Dad!  Hello!  Did I mention ... no problem!!?

184
00:12:21,056 --> 00:12:23,737
So it's not a problem? 
/ No.

185
00:12:23,737 --> 00:12:25,954
Oh, great.  
Then it's not a problem.

186
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,645
Thanks, son.

187
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:30,740
Oh, I don't believe this.
  Mr. Sheffield ...

188
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,583
can I talk to you for just one minute?
 / I doubt it.

189
00:12:34,913 --> 00:12:37,878
Mr. Sheffield, how can you 
not take him to the game?

190
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:40,699
Can't you see you're breaking 
that little boy's heart?

191
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:43,232
He said it was no problem.  
You must have heard him.

192
00:12:43,232 --> 00:12:45,856
Oh, of course, that's what he said. 
 That's what kids always say.

193
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:49,559
They're not going to tell their father
 when they're dying inside.

194
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:54,095
They give off signals. 
 They act morose.

195
00:12:55,005 --> 00:12:58,641
Sometimes they even have 
fits of anger.

196
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:05,326
And, finally, if
 they're despondent enough,

197
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,391
they might even be driven
 to acts of violence.

198
00:13:08,391 --> 00:13:10,113
Ouch!

199
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:17,863
And that concludes today's
 audio/visual demonstration.

200
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:31,214
Look at me, Ma.  I look just
 like Barbra in "Yentel."

201
00:13:31,508 --> 00:13:35,732
Oh, Fran, this is the most
 exciting moment of my life.

202
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:40,195
Dressing my daughter for
 Barbra Streisand.

203
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:44,307
I thought the most exciting day was 
gonna be when you dressed me for my wedding.

204
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:48,462
Hm.  I decided to live for today.

205
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,732
Oy ... 
/ Girl, what's the matter?

206
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:56,967
Your excitement peeked too early
 and now you're depleted?

207
00:13:56,967 --> 00:14:00,091
No, I just don't think
 I should be going.

208
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:03,791
Bite your tongue! 
 Don't you love Barbra anymore?

209
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,837
Ma, she's our leader.

210
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:13,485
Ah, I just think Mr. Babcock should be
 taking his daughter instead of me.

211
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,012
Miss Babcock doesn't wanna go.

212
00:14:16,012 --> 00:14:19,099
Oh, she's afraid to 
reach out to him.

213
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:22,590
Don't you see?  He's a father
 looking for a daughter,

214
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,202
she's a daughter looking 
for her father.

215
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:29,104
They're like two trains in the tunnel,
 one is the express, one's the local,

216
00:14:29,104 --> 00:14:34,313
going side by side, never meeting up.
  I'll tell ya, it's a tragedy.

217
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,572
Fran, look.

218
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:42,367
Oh, the Barbra Quarterly.  
Oh, I love the Barbara Quarterly.

219
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:46,483
And Fran, look.
 / Oh, "Color Me Barbra."

220
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:50,871
Oh, I love "Color Me Barbra." 
 Ma, don't do this to me.

221
00:14:50,871 --> 00:14:54,092
And Fran, look.
 / Oh ....

222
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,718
My "On A Clear Day" wig.

223
00:14:58,718 --> 00:15:03,544
Oh, Ma, I used to love this so. 
 Remember, I'd wear it everywhere.

224
00:15:03,544 --> 00:15:06,631
Even to Uncle Harry's funeral.

225
00:15:06,631 --> 00:15:11,669
Was that in poor taste, Ma?
 / No.  He loved her, too.

226
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,104
So you'll go. 
/ No.

227
00:15:14,104 --> 00:15:19,114
Why not?!!!! / I just can't, 
Ma, and it's all your fault.

228
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:22,193
Mine?
 / Yes, because you raised me too good.

229
00:15:22,193 --> 00:15:25,055
Wasn't it you who said, 
"Family comes first"?

230
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:28,471
Our family, not theirs.

231
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:32,953
Oh ....

232
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:37,227
Oh, Niles, there's 
someone at the door.

233
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:41,076
Oh, and I thought another 
angel got its wings.

234
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:47,085
You should do something about your feet. 
/ Oh, perhaps I can chew them off.

235
00:15:47,085 --> 00:15:49,489
I'm thinking more of a visit
 to a chiropodist, but ...

236
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:51,925
as long as you take care of it.

237
00:15:52,481 --> 00:15:54,311
Oh ... oh ....

238
00:15:54,793 --> 00:15:57,236
Oh, just come in!!!!

239
00:15:58,905 --> 00:16:03,490
Good evening, Niles. / Sir.  I ...
 I can't get you anything, can I, sir?

240
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,740
No, no, no. 
 Maybe just a martini.

241
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,827
Extra dry?
 / Oh, don't worry.

242
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:13,547
By the time you get it,
 it will be evaporated.

243
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,389
You look stunning! 
 Just like Audrey Hepburn.

244
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:26,905
Oh ... too bad
 I sound like Selma Diamond.

245
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:29,641
You ready?

246
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:33,180
I can't believe
 I'm about to say this, but ...

247
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,206
I can't go.

248
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:37,661
Why not?

249
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:41,371
Oh, because I'm this
 old softy, and well,

250
00:16:41,371 --> 00:16:44,308
I think you should take C.C.

251
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:46,804
But I want to take you.

252
00:16:46,804 --> 00:16:49,178
All right, let's go. 
/ Fine.

253
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:51,416
Oh, no, no, no. 
 I can't, I can't.

254
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:57,863
"Memories, light the corner of my heart."
 / Ma, knock it off!

255
00:16:57,863 --> 00:17:01,338
Kitten, this is ridiculous.  
C.C. doesn't even wanna go.

256
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:04,207
Yes, she does, because
 she wants to be with you,

257
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:07,105
but she's afraid to tell you that
 she wants to be with you

258
00:17:07,105 --> 00:17:09,971
because she thinks that
 you don't want to be with her.

259
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:14,503
"Misty water colored memories ...."

260
00:17:14,503 --> 00:17:18,889
Ma, ganug already! 
 You're startin' the twilight bar.

261
00:17:19,586 --> 00:17:24,199
I've tried to reach out to C.C.,
 but she pushes me away.

262
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:26,378
She just doesn't
 want to be with me.

263
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:32,411
She does wanna be with you, but she 
needs to know that you want to be with her.

264
00:17:32,411 --> 00:17:35,994
People .... 
 "People who need people are ..."

265
00:17:35,994 --> 00:17:38,152
Ah, you'll see the concert.

266
00:17:39,242 --> 00:17:41,516
You're very wise. / Oh.

267
00:17:42,918 --> 00:17:43,913
Ahhh ...

268
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,554
Daddy!

269
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,982
She also has her mother's timing.

270
00:17:52,074 --> 00:17:56,100
C.C., open this door!  Your father 
and I are very concerned about you!

271
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,074
Go away!

272
00:17:58,587 --> 00:18:02,621
Open up, young lady!
 / Niles, run and get a butter knife.

273
00:18:02,621 --> 00:18:05,682
Oh, why don't we just
 starve her out?

274
00:18:06,092 --> 00:18:09,261
Ma, use your nail.  
Her nails can open anything

275
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:12,451
letters, diaries, 
my old boyfriend's Chevy.

276
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:15,170
I never had any privacy as a child.

277
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,796
Got it.  Acrylic.

278
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:22,053
C.C. 
/ I don't wanna talk to you.

279
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:24,734
All right, I'm comin' in.  
Cover me.

280
00:18:26,484 --> 00:18:30,409
Ah, smoking!  
Not in my house, young lady.

281
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,918
It's not your house and 
it's none of your business.

282
00:18:33,918 --> 00:18:38,575
And while we're having
 this little girl talk, I loathe you.

283
00:18:41,214 --> 00:18:45,163
At least you're opening up.  Now, 
I wanna talk to you about your father.

284
00:18:45,163 --> 00:18:49,199
You have got to stop pushing people away.
 / I don't push people away.

285
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:53,005
Excuse me, I'm trying to get
 some ash out of your hair.

286
00:18:53,005 --> 00:19:00,056
People misunderstand me.  They think 
I'm a self-centered, cold-hearted witch.

287
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,531
Is everything all right?

288
00:19:06,531 --> 00:19:10,977
If they're like my Morty, 
they could be in there for hours.

289
00:19:11,188 --> 00:19:15,185
You know, Fran was right.  I should have
 spent more time with C.C. when she was little.

290
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:19,231
Oh, Miss Fein has this annoying way
 of being right about those things.

291
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:26,054
Yeah, yeah.  Meanwhile, if ... 
you need another escort for the concert ...

292
00:19:26,054 --> 00:19:32,766
this outfit goes from day to night
 with just a few accessories.

293
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:35,093
I have the knife.

294
00:19:35,093 --> 00:19:38,300
Oh, that's all right, Niles.  
We don't need it now. / Mmm ....

295
00:19:40,578 --> 00:19:46,032
The thing is I just don't
 know what to do!!!

296
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:51,749
Oh, there, there. 
 That's okay.

297
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:56,567
Okay.  Sssh ... ssh. 
 That's all right.

298
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:59,824
Hello?  Calling next of kin.

299
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,202
Sssh ....  Yeah, 
here's your daddy.

300
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:06,344
Here's your daddy.

301
00:20:07,112 --> 00:20:10,718
I have never seen her cry before.  
Well, maybe the crash of eighty-seven.

302
00:20:10,718 --> 00:20:14,611
Oh! Ask her to the concert.

303
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:20,443
I would really love it if ... you would
 come with me to the concert tonight.

304
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:24,493
You would? 
/ Of course he would.

305
00:20:24,493 --> 00:20:28,992
And C.C., I think you are very lucky
 to have a friend like Fran.

306
00:20:28,992 --> 00:20:31,406
I know.

307
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:39,363
She's wonderful.  She's gonna
 let me wear her dress.

308
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:45,939
Bye!  Have a good time.

309
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:49,789
Don't forget my Barbra program
 and my Barbra t-shirt

310
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:54,391
and my Barbra mug with 
the nose handle!

311
00:20:56,036 --> 00:20:57,195
... Oh ....

312
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,268
Darling, you did a good thing.

313
00:21:01,268 --> 00:21:04,252
An incredibly stupid thing.

314
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:08,889
Yeah, well, you're the one that had 
the doctors use forceps when they delivered me.

315
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:14,291
The pain you caused me.  
I would have let them use the Jaws of Life.

316
00:21:16,006 --> 00:21:19,909
Miss Fein, that was a very lovely
 thing you did for C.C.

317
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:23,550
And I'm about to follow
 your selfless example.

318
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,670
Oh, well, good, then you could 
be as happy as I am.

319
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:30,385
Son, good news.

320
00:21:30,385 --> 00:21:34,194
I've cancelled my theater lecture,
 so I can take you to the ballgame.

321
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:37,287
Bad news, Dad. 
 I made other plans.

322
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:39,521
But ... but I thought it was 
really important to you.

323
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:43,308
No, I told you I didn't care. 
/ Ah, but you didn't really mean that.

324
00:21:43,308 --> 00:21:46,883
Yeah, I did.  I don't know how 
I could have made it any clearer.

325
00:21:46,883 --> 00:21:50,981
Well, he did say it was no problem.
 / Miss Fein!

326
00:21:51,623 --> 00:21:54,535
Don't be disappointed, Dad. 
 I'll go with you to another game.

327
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:58,358
The Mets aren't going anywhere.
 / That's for sure.

328
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:21,160
"The Way We Were."

329
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,265
That is the best that Barbra 
ever sang that song.

330
00:22:26,265 --> 00:22:29,250
I just love her. 
/ I love her more.

331
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:33,265
I loved her first.
 / I'll love her last.

332
00:22:35,433 --> 00:22:40,688
Wha?  Oh, Ma, listen, Stu says 
he's got a surprise for us.

333
00:22:42,312 --> 00:22:45,233
Hello, gorgeous.

334
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,408
Why are we always arguing
 about who's her biggest fan?

335
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:58,626
There's plenty of room in 
Barbra's life for both of us.

336
00:22:58,626 --> 00:23:01,087
Now let's continue.

337
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:06,348
"scattered pictures of the smiles 
we left behind ...

338
00:23:06,348 --> 00:23:11,038
smiles we gave
 to one another ...

339
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:14,071
of the way we were."

340
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:17,462
Don't you just love sitting 
around singin' Barbra tunes?
