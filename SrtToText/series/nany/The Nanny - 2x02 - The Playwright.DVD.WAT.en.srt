1
00:00:02,406 --> 00:00:07,538
Niles, and Brighton. 
 This is Maggie's.

2
00:00:07,538 --> 00:00:12,192
Oh, who, ha, Mister Sheffield!

3
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:15,962
Guess again.

4
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:26,579
Well that's way more than
 I needed to know about him.

5
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,705
Oh, hi, kids.  How are you 
doing on your science project?

6
00:00:29,705 --> 00:00:32,908
Ask Brooke.  She's the genius. 
 I'm just the dumb blonde.

7
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh...  Me and Val used to do science
 projects together. What's yours about?

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,278
Stress in the earth's igneous layers 
and its effects on geological topography.

9
00:00:42,278 --> 00:00:45,713
Oh.  We grew potatoes on toothpicks.

10
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:49,477
Did you know that if you squeeze coal
 really hard, it turns into a diamond?

11
00:00:49,477 --> 00:00:50,759
Oh, not true.

12
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:56,696
One summer me and Val went through
 a whole bag of Kingsford
 Briquettes trying for earrings.

13
00:00:57,548 --> 00:01:03,328
No luck, huh? / No way.  But to this day 
I got a handshake like Lou Ferrigna.

14
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:08,784
Oh, Brighton, do you have a date
 for the seventh grade dance?

15
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:12,015
Yeah, I got a couple of irons 
in the fire, put out a few feelers.

16
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:15,353
Yeah.  Neither do I.

17
00:01:15,353 --> 00:01:22,041
I'll probably just go all by myself and
 stand alone on the side with all the other wallflowers.

18
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,925
Oh good, so you're covered.

19
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:26,673
Yeah.

20
00:01:27,657 --> 00:01:30,875
Excuse me.  I have to take
 my allergy pills.

21
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:34,975
Oh, what are you allergic to, honey?
 / Everything but pollen.

22
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:40,615
Ow!  Fran, I am not asking 
her to the dance.

23
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:42,290
All right.

24
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,459
You're not gonna say anything?

25
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:45,482
It's not my place.

26
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:48,529
God will punish you.

27
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:53,557
Fran, look at her with those braids.  
She looks like Alfalfa.

28
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,581
And with those allergies, 
she's always so nasal.

29
00:01:56,581 --> 00:02:00,942
Hey, a lot of men find 
that very alluring.

30
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,705
Yeah, right.  If I don't ask her 
to the dance, she might get upset

31
00:02:07,705 --> 00:02:10,810
and there goes an automatic
 `A' in science.

32
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,390
Well, as long as his heart's 
in the right place.

33
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,651
Oh, I remember my first dance. 
 I went with Richie Schneider.

34
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:20,440
He had two left feet. 
/ Oh, a bit of a klutz, eh?

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,274
No, he had two left feet.

36
00:02:25,274 --> 00:02:30,252
Some freak thing. His mother
 was an X-ray technician.

37
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:35,717
I'm confused. Could he dance or not?

38
00:02:35,717 --> 00:02:38,581
Actually, he was an excellent dancer.

39
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:43,284
Except when they did the hokey poky, 
and they said put your left foot in...

40
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:50,463
The poor boy went down
 like a ton of bricks.

41
00:03:43,543 --> 00:03:46,595
So, Sheffield, who are 
you gonna take to the dance?

42
00:03:46,595 --> 00:03:48,829
Oh, just an old friend.

43
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:53,660
Oh, hi, honey.
 I'm sorry I'm late, sweetie.

44
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,945
I didn't have a pass, and that
 hall monitor's a real little Nazi.

45
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:02,639
Whoa, Sheffield, way to go.

46
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,437
No.  She's the nanny. 
 But you know, she wants me.

47
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,461
What?

48
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:13,556
Wants me to go to the orthodontist.
 / Hm-hmm.  Come on.

49
00:04:13,556 --> 00:04:16,033
Hi, Brighton.
 / Oh, no...

50
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:20,103
It's the Brooke worm.

51
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:22,380
I'm glad you're still here.

52
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,052
I fell in the A.D. room and had
 to get a bandaid for my glasses.

53
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:28,583
Plus my inhaler clogged.

54
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:31,563
Honey, honey, men like 
a little mystery.

55
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,275
Don't share.
 / Right...

56
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,125
Okay, Fran, let's go. 
/ Brighton, wait.

57
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,852
My father wants to know
 if he should drive us on Friday.

58
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,645
What are you talking about?

59
00:04:42,645 --> 00:04:44,632
You asked me to the dance.

60
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:49,390
Look, I don't know what's in that inhaler,
 but I wouldn't operate heavy machinery.

61
00:04:49,592 --> 00:04:52,370
Brighton! 
/ Oh, forget it.

62
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,286
Oh, Brooke... 
 Brighton, that was very mean!

63
00:04:56,286 --> 00:04:59,905
Now look what you've done.  
You made her wheeze.

64
00:05:02,696 --> 00:05:05,710
Brighton, 
I am so disappointed in you.

65
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,396
Fran, you've been yelling at me 
since Sixtyeighth Street.  
Are you gonna keep it up the whole way?

66
00:05:09,396 --> 00:05:14,059
No.  As soon as we pass Bergdorf's
 I'm gonna start slapping you!

67
00:05:14,507 --> 00:05:17,049
Fran, it was no big deal.

68
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:21,353
Don't you know what happens to young girls
 when you torture them in high school?

69
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:25,793
Oh, we're going to the video store
 and I'm renting you Carrie.

70
00:05:26,258 --> 00:05:28,475
There's a very big likeness.
 / Yeah, yeah.

71
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:30,869
But, you know, it's too late
 to do anything about it now.

72
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:35,308
No, it's never too late to right 
a wrong that you've done to another human being.

73
00:05:35,308 --> 00:05:41,891
Yeah.  Unless, of course, that human being
 has been shattered into a million miserable pieces!

74
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:43,617
Oh, right.

75
00:05:44,246 --> 00:05:47,419
Uh, I work alone here.

76
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:51,623
Your behavior could scar 
that little girl for the rest of her life.

77
00:05:51,623 --> 00:05:55,309
And you should know.  Hypocrite!

78
00:05:55,309 --> 00:05:58,663
Let me guess, you don't survive 
on tips, do you, Mister...

79
00:05:58,663 --> 00:06:04,395
Ahzee mah boo ala plea.

80
00:06:04,763 --> 00:06:06,678
I share the cab.

81
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:10,432
Oh.  Jeffrey Needleman. 
 Jeffrey Needleman?

82
00:06:10,432 --> 00:06:11,913
Yeah, let me give you a hint, okay?

83
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:16,784
Picture me cramped in a locker with 
a wedgie and a "kick me" sign on my forehead.

84
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:21,560
"Kick me" signs go on your back. 
/ Yeah. They wanted me to see it coming.

85
00:06:21,776 --> 00:06:24,596
This guy's the most
 pathetic loser on earth.

86
00:06:24,596 --> 00:06:28,897
Oh...Jeffrey Needleman.

87
00:06:28,897 --> 00:06:32,712
Oh, Jeffrey, what have you been
 doing since high school?

88
00:06:32,712 --> 00:06:38,345
Shock therapy. / Oh, oh...  Nice to see
 things are picking up for you.

89
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:43,342
So, in other words, you guys went to 
high school together and you tortured him.

90
00:06:43,342 --> 00:06:47,403
I'm not the only one that 
tortured him. The whole school did.

91
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:51,717
It was a requirement.  It got you
 out of talking a foreign language class.

92
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:54,623
Oh, Fran, I am so disappointed in you.

93
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:58,355
All right, okay.  That's enough.

94
00:06:58,355 --> 00:07:02,736
You're right.  It's not my place.
  God will punish you.

95
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:07,503
You know, I remember you saying that
 you'd go out with me that Sunday.

96
00:07:07,503 --> 00:07:11,695
I said some day.

97
00:07:11,695 --> 00:07:15,926
Some day.  And that was only because
 you were standing out on a ledge.

98
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:19,587
Is it some day yet?

99
00:07:20,943 --> 00:07:23,887
Oh, I don't know, Jeffrey.
 I'm so busy.

100
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:26,505
I, I really don't know 
when I'll find the time.

101
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:29,665
Hey, you're free Saturday. 
 It's your day off.

102
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:34,608
Yes, that's true.  But I might have to go 
visit that poor little boy in the hospital

103
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:39,874
after that unfortunate high heel
 to the butt accident!

104
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:45,962
Come on, Fran, you're gonna be late
 for your date.  The meter's running!

105
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:50,919
I don't feel a hundred percent.

106
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:56,802
Do I sound like I'm coming 
down with a cold? / Constantly.

107
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:02,285
No, I mean it.  
See if I have a temperature.

108
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:05,042
Oh, not the old thermometer 
in the light bulb trick.

109
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:10,014
Brighton, please.
 / A hundred and twelve, Miss Fine.

110
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:14,862
Damn halogen lamps.

111
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:17,428
Fran, I'm very proud of you 
for going through with this.

112
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:20,055
It's never too late
 to right a wrong.

113
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:25,705
Why aren't you under a blanket with a flashlight
 reading National Geographic like a normal kid?

114
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:28,828
Oh, Maxwell, please?
  I'm begging you.

115
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:32,562
It'll only take a couple of minutes. 
 You don't even have to like it.

116
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:36,137
There's a speech she knows by heart.

117
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:46,594
C.C., you know my policy.  I never read
 plays written by friends, or relatives.

118
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:50,025
Or that Broadway bon vivant,
 your psychiatrist.

119
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:52,032
But I told him you would read it.

120
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,994
And I don't want to risk offending him.  
We're on the verge of a breakthrough.

121
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:59,197
Oh, good.  Maybe he'll find 
a personality we like.

122
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:03,800
Well, I'm terribly sorry, C.C., but I
 simply don't do business favors for friends.

123
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,138
Well, I have to agree 
with Mister Sheffield on that one.

124
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:10,647
I have an Uncle Aaron... 
/ Oh...

125
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:16,356
...he manufactured hernia trusses and
 he gave one to his friend, Murray.

126
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:19,387
Well, P.S., he put it
 on backwards, Murray,

127
00:09:19,387 --> 00:09:22,345
and cut off his circulation. 
 Double amputation.

128
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:26,144
And I'm not talking 
about his legs.

129
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,065
Miss Fine, isn't 
this your day off?

130
00:09:29,065 --> 00:09:34,357
Um, yeah, but I decided that I owe you
 for that Jewish holiday that I made up.

131
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:37,528
You mean, there is no Matzo Day?

132
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,208
Uh-uh. / Well, we forgive you.
  Just go on your date.

133
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,714
Oh, yes, by all means.  Go have fun. 
/ Uh, no, no, no, I have to...

134
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:47,564
Here, I have to take Gracie 
to her ballet class.

135
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:49,513
Oh, no I'm taking her.
 / Oh.

136
00:09:49,513 --> 00:09:54,806
Yeah, she's got a crush on my teacher, 
big time. / Oh, that's nice.

137
00:09:54,806 --> 00:09:57,447
Oh, he is so cute.
  And talented.

138
00:09:57,447 --> 00:10:01,605
You should see his impersonation 
of Liza Minnelli.

139
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:09,426
I'm gonna have to have
 a talk with her.

140
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:18,217
Good afternoon. 
 I'm here to meet a man.

141
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:22,613
Might I suggest Happy Hour
 at the Black Angus?

142
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,403
Oh, never mind.  
That's him.

143
00:10:28,403 --> 00:10:32,590
Oh, Franny, oh, look at you. 
 You look scrump-de-a-licious.

144
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,061
Oh...  He's a war hero.

145
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,416
Here you are, my good man.
  Your best table.

146
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:43,676
Save it.  You may want
 to do laundry later.

147
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:58,483
What? Oh, no, no.
  I brought one for you, too.

148
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:00,182
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

149
00:11:00,182 --> 00:11:06,155
That's very sweet, but I don't think
 I'd be comfortable sitting on wooden balls...

150
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:09,368
at least not on the first date.

151
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:17,036
I'm telling you.  You drive a cab, 
everybody thinks you're invisible.

152
00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:19,790
You know how many men pick their nose?  Huh? 
/ Oh, I don't know. No, I have no idea.

153
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,962
Huh?  No, take a guess. 
 Go ahead, give it a shot. Give it a shot.

154
00:11:21,962 --> 00:11:25,294
One out of five.

155
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:28,550
Jeffrey, you're such a raconteur.

156
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:32,245
Oh, I got a million stories. 
/ You shouldn't waste them all on me.

157
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:35,627
You should write some of this stuff down. 
/ Actually, I have.

158
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:37,243
Oh / I wrote a play.

159
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:39,673
Oh, isn't that a coincidence?

160
00:11:39,673 --> 00:11:44,570
I happen to work for
 a Broadway...bus driver.

161
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:49,192
A bus driver who can afford 
a nanny? / Oh, unions.

162
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:52,214
Oh, oh, I almost forgot.  Here.

163
00:11:52,214 --> 00:11:53,576
Oh... / I brought this for you.

164
00:11:53,576 --> 00:11:58,750
...Jeffrey, you didn't have to get
 me a...blue frost eye shadow kit?

165
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,982
That's your blue frost 
eye shadow kit.

166
00:12:00,982 --> 00:12:04,187
You remember?  Mrs. Barnett 
confiscated it from you in homeroom.

167
00:12:04,187 --> 00:12:06,787
I swiped it from her desk.

168
00:12:06,787 --> 00:12:10,943
And you saved it all these years.

169
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:14,825
Oh... Isn't that sweet, Jeffrey.

170
00:12:14,825 --> 00:12:18,066
And yet oddly disturbing.

171
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:21,708
You know what would make me
 the happiest man on earth?

172
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,104
What?

173
00:12:23,104 --> 00:12:25,239
Look, I, I know you didn't wanna
 do it with me in high school,

174
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:29,586
but I, I, I was hoping that
 you had changed your mind.

175
00:12:29,586 --> 00:12:32,564
I, I doubt it.

176
00:12:32,564 --> 00:12:35,787
Oh, what the hell?  Why don't 
we do it right here on the floor?

177
00:12:35,787 --> 00:12:39,022
Oh, check, please!
 / Come on, Fran.  Do the Hustle.

178
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:41,223
What? 
/ Come on, please.  Dance with me.

179
00:12:41,223 --> 00:12:46,495
Oh, Jeffrey, I don't think
 I remember the Hustle anymore...

180
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:37,370
Oh, Jeffrey, I think 
I pulled a Hustle muscle.

181
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:42,751
That was fantastic. / Thank you.
  I, I have a great partner over at Arthur Murray.

182
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:46,412
She's eightytwo, but boy,
 can she turn the beat around.

183
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,575
You know, Jeffrey, this isn't 
such a bad date afterall.

184
00:13:50,575 --> 00:13:52,800
Good.  Marry me.

185
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:01,353
You're kidding, aren't you?
 / Please.

186
00:14:01,745 --> 00:14:05,957
Oh, Jeffrey, it's incredibly
 flattering and

187
00:14:05,957 --> 00:14:09,274
well I hope you don't take
 this the wrong way...

188
00:14:09,522 --> 00:14:13,312
Jeffrey, Jeffrey, don't jump! 
 Did he pay the check?

189
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:22,215
Jeffrey, don't jump. 
 You have too much to live for.

190
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:24,686
Yeah?  Yeah? Name one thing.

191
00:14:24,686 --> 00:14:26,894
Give me a minute.

192
00:14:26,894 --> 00:14:29,383
Goodbye.
 / No, Jeffrey, wait!  Ahh...

193
00:14:29,591 --> 00:14:34,743
He jumped? 
/ No.  I leaned on pigeon poop.

194
00:14:36,415 --> 00:14:38,421
I mean it.  
I'm gonna jump.

195
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:41,693
Jeffrey, please, I'll do whatever you say.
 / Sleep with me.

196
00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:45,079
What's your second choice?
 / Another date.

197
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:47,731
And what else you got?
 / Okay, fine, that's it.

198
00:14:47,731 --> 00:14:50,134
No, Jeffrey, wait, wait.

199
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:52,177
Maybe you should take off your heels.

200
00:14:52,177 --> 00:14:56,179
Are you crazy?  That would screw up
 my balance completely...

201
00:14:57,182 --> 00:15:01,943
Oh, oh my God. Jeffrey,
 look how high up we are.

202
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:05,528
Oh, Jeffrey, I'm a scared.
 Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.

203
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:10,043
I'm gonna jump. / Let go of my hand!
  Let go of my hand!

204
00:15:11,004 --> 00:15:15,282
Oh, Jeffrey, look at all those people
 down there staring up at us.

205
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:17,857
You wearing underwear?

206
00:15:18,724 --> 00:15:21,303
Of course I am...

207
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:26,398
Jeffrey, please, let's go inside.

208
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:30,125
No.  No, if I can't have you,
 I have no	reason to live.

209
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,517
Sure you do. You got friends.
 / None.

210
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:33,794
Family. / Estranged.

211
00:15:33,794 --> 00:15:36,458
A dog. 
/ Bit me.

212
00:15:36,747 --> 00:15:38,345
I know. Your writing.

213
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:41,344
Oh, yeah.  That, that's a dead end.
 Nobody's gonna read my play.

214
00:15:41,344 --> 00:15:43,996
In this town, you have	to know somebody.

215
00:15:43,996 --> 00:15:49,194
I know somebody.  I work for Maxwell 
Sheffield, the big Broadway producer.

216
00:15:49,194 --> 00:15:51,599
I thought you worked for a bus driver?

217
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:54,803
Bus driver and Broadway producer.

218
00:15:54,803 --> 00:15:57,631
Well, he wasn't gonna
 give up that pension.

219
00:16:00,398 --> 00:16:04,258
I don't mean to be negative here, 
but I don't think this spud 
is gonna get us an `A'.

220
00:16:04,258 --> 00:16:07,061
I don't need an `A'.  I always get an `A'.

221
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:10,445
I wanna see what a `D' feels like.

222
00:16:10,445 --> 00:16:15,195
Oh, you're mad about the dance.
 / And they say I'm the genius.

223
00:16:15,195 --> 00:16:18,424
Brooke, we've been friends for 
a long time now.  Why do things have to change?

224
00:16:18,424 --> 00:16:21,923
I'm a woman now.  I have needs.

225
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:25,162
Yeah, well I have needs, too. 
 I need an `A' in Science.

226
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:29,471
Oh, hello, Brooke. 
/ Men!

227
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:33,605
Women! 
/ What was that all about?

228
00:16:33,605 --> 00:16:35,970
Why do girls have to take 
everything so	personally?

229
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,153
Oh well, women are just different from us,
 son. They're, they're more emotional.

230
00:16:40,153 --> 00:16:44,820
I mean, when I get a bad review,
 I don't run crying to Niles and say `I need a hug.'

231
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,433
Well, there was that one time
 in New Haven.

232
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:52,128
That review was scathing.

233
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:55,674
Thanks, guys.  Big help.

234
00:16:57,214 --> 00:17:00,011
Oh, Fran, I feel really 
guilty about Brooke.

235
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:02,683
Oh, honey, take her, 
don't take her.

236
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:04,610
Do whatever you wanna do.

237
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,443
Okay.  I'll just
 grow up by myself.

238
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,134
Wait, Fran.

239
00:17:10,134 --> 00:17:11,574
You like my make-up?
 / Uh-huh.

240
00:17:11,574 --> 00:17:15,587
Gracie's ballet teacher did it for me.
 / Oh...

241
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:20,783
Ballet teacher and make-up artist.

242
00:17:20,783 --> 00:17:24,375
Honey, we're definitely gonna have
 to have a talk.  Just not now, okay?

243
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,620
I'm in a terrible hurry.

244
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,114
And it was a not a hug, 
it was a pat on the back.

245
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:34,287
I just had a particularly horrid review
 and was looking for a little understanding.

246
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:39,250
You wept openly, sir, and it was 
very uncomfortable for me.

247
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,549
It was nineteen-seventytwo.  We were 
all getting in touch with our feelings.

248
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:47,814
Mister Sheffield, Mister Sheffield,
 we got a crisis on our hands.

249
00:17:47,814 --> 00:17:50,434
Don't crumble, sir.

250
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,067
Aren't you supposed to be on a date? 
/ Well, technically, I still am.

251
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:57,720
Oh.  How's it going? / Oh, I've
 had better.  I've had worse.

252
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,092
It's kind of up in the air.

253
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:04,195
Why didn't you take
 my emergency call?!

254
00:18:04,195 --> 00:18:09,596
Because the last time you had the operator
 break through it was to tape The Bold And Beautiful.

255
00:18:09,596 --> 00:18:12,166
Well, Storm was about
 to marry Stephanie.

256
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:16,244
So what's the problem?
 / She's his mother.

257
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:21,499
Miss Fine, I believe you mentioned
 something about a crisis.

258
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:24,813
Oh, yeah, my date is about 
to kill himself!

259
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,863
Oh, you didn't tell him 
the hernia story, did you?

260
00:18:27,863 --> 00:18:31,000
Or Aunt Frieda's 
lyposuction mishap?

261
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,827
Uncle Jack's dependence on vino?

262
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:37,674
No.  I'm serious.

263
00:18:37,674 --> 00:18:41,181
You have to read his play.
 It's a matter of life and death.

264
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:45,799
Maxwell, if she gets to show you
 her's, I get to show you mine.

265
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:50,566
Oh, that ain't worth it.  
Let him jump. / Let who jump?

266
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:55,424
My date.  He is standing out on a ledge.
 He is about to kill himself.

267
00:18:55,424 --> 00:18:57,420
My God, this is terrible.

268
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,993
I'll say.  Well, not a total loss. 
The Clams Casino are to die for.

269
00:19:01,993 --> 00:19:03,471
Could you please just...
 / Not now, Brighton.

270
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:05,216
But I really... 
/ Later, Brighton.

271
00:19:05,216 --> 00:19:08,702
But it's really important! 
 I need to talk to someone now!

272
00:19:08,702 --> 00:19:14,037
Aunt C.C.'s still here.
 / It can wait.

273
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:23,985
Then she says I'm sorry...

274
00:19:29,212 --> 00:19:30,589
Wait.  I'm not through yet.

275
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:34,600
Miss Fine, there
 is some urgency here.

276
00:19:34,953 --> 00:19:37,109
...get in, in the...  Okay.

277
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:40,938
Come on, is he through yet? 
 I'm freezing out here.

278
00:19:41,112 --> 00:19:44,357
Well, you know what you could do. 
 You could come in!

279
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:47,230
You're right.  Oh, oh no, nice try.

280
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,182
Here. I'm through with the soup.

281
00:19:49,182 --> 00:19:51,916
You want a sweet? / Uh, no, no. 
 I gotta watch my weight.

282
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:55,991
What's the matter? You're afraid 
you're gonna make a bigger hole?

283
00:19:56,953 --> 00:19:58,814
All right, what d' you got?

284
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:02,522
Uh...  Oh, they got a tarter
 tan, a linzer tart.

285
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:06,913
Oh, this looks good. / You know,
 they got, got any chocolate cake?

286
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:09,314
No.

287
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:13,106
I don't hear laughing.

288
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:17,182
You're kidding? Kidding?  Which part?
  Which part? / The funny part.

289
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:21,576
He hates it. / Oh, what are
 you listening to him for?

290
00:20:21,576 --> 00:20:24,780
He passed on Cats.

291
00:20:25,148 --> 00:20:28,669
It was singing pussycat people,

292
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:32,432
in a giant garbage can. I mean, 
what would you have done?

293
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:36,983
Two words, Mister Sheffield: 
 Still running.

294
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:42,641
But what, Jeffrey, what do you always 
care what everybody else thinks?

295
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,709
Why?  You don't think I should?

296
00:20:48,218 --> 00:20:49,956
It's a brilliant play.

297
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:52,346
Oh, come on, Mister Sheffield. 
 You don't have to lay it on so thick.

298
00:20:52,346 --> 00:20:56,034
No.  No, no, no.  I, I mean. 
 I'm going to auction it.

299
00:20:56,034 --> 00:20:58,997
Did you hear that, Jeffrey? 
 He's gonna buy your play!

300
00:20:58,997 --> 00:21:03,073
All right...! 
/ No...!

301
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:10,546
I'm all right.  
I'm all right.

302
00:21:10,807 --> 00:21:13,805
God, he landed right in that
 huge mountain of garbage.

303
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:18,215
Oh boy, is he lucky we live in New York.

304
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:25,623
Oh, B, you look so handsome.
  Smile.

305
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:29,999
Oh, you and Brooke are gonna be
 the cutest couple at the dance.

306
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:32,067
Yeah, but the guys are gonna shred me.

307
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:35,677
Oh, honey, you just remember
 that you're more mature than they are.

308
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:38,397
You just walk in there 
and hold your head up high.

309
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,695
Look `em square
 in the eye and say,

310
00:21:40,695 --> 00:21:43,942
"So's your mother."

311
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:48,480
So, Brighton, your first 
date alone with a girl.

312
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,818
Is there anything 
we need to talk about?

313
00:21:50,818 --> 00:21:53,046
Dad, please,
 I'm going out with Brooke.

314
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:54,615
So you don't have 
any questions?

315
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:57,583
Yeah.  Why am I going out with Brooke?

316
00:21:58,055 --> 00:22:00,692
How do I look? / Great. 
/ There you go. / Thank you.

317
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,555
Wow.

318
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:13,130
Hi, Brighton.
 / Wow.

319
00:22:13,594 --> 00:22:16,884
Are you ready to go, Brighton? 
/ Just one second.

320
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:19,662
Dad, can we have that talk?

321
00:22:19,662 --> 00:22:21,971
Go on, son.  You'll be just fine.

322
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:26,017
See?  You did the right thing
 and God smiled on you.

323
00:22:26,384 --> 00:22:30,908
God, Maybelline, 
and half-a-box of Kleenex.

324
00:22:32,222 --> 00:22:33,785
Thanks, Fran.

325
00:22:34,242 --> 00:22:37,253
Fran, how do I look? 
/ Ravishing as always.

326
00:22:37,253 --> 00:22:40,081
Good.  `Cause I'm going to pick up 
Gracie from ballet class.

327
00:22:40,081 --> 00:22:42,586
Oh, her teacher is so gorgeous.

328
00:22:42,586 --> 00:22:46,565
I don't know who's cuter.  
Him or his roommate, Chuck.

329
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:53,561
Chuck, huh?  Honey, it's time
 we had that little talk...

330
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:57,606
Huh?...

331
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,108
Get ready...



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
