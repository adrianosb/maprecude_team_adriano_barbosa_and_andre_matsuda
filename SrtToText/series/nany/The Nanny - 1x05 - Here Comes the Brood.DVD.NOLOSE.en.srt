1
00:00:05,151 --> 00:00:09,838
Hurry up, kids,
the limo's waiting.

2
00:00:10,935 --> 00:00:14,847
I love saying that.
/ And I love hearing it.  Oh...

3
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:19,795
Oh, I'll get it.
You finish.

4
00:00:19,795 --> 00:00:23,549
I have finished.
/ Oh, well you look again.

5
00:00:25,586 --> 00:00:29,531
Good morning, Miss Babcock.
Come in, make yourself comfortable.

6
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:31,808
I see you have.

7
00:00:31,808 --> 00:00:36,210
You don't know.  Between the boss
and the kids, who's got time to dress?

8
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,816
Mister Sheffield,
Miss Babcock's here!

9
00:00:39,816 --> 00:00:42,295
Miss Fine, please!

10
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:46,713
They've already
freed Willy.

11
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,844
Oh, well don't you
girls look gorgeous.

12
00:00:49,844 --> 00:00:52,024
We wear these same
uniforms every day.

13
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:55,650
Trust me.  Men dream
about these outfits.

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,244
Come on, Brighton.
You're gonna miss the limo.

15
00:00:59,244 --> 00:01:01,782
Is it the stretch or the town car?
/ Oh, what do you care?

16
00:01:01,782 --> 00:01:07,572
Just be grateful.  Your father had to
walk ten miles in the snow to get to his limo.

17
00:01:07,572 --> 00:01:09,711
Good morning, everyone.

18
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:13,342
Oh boy, don't you look handsome.
/ Well, thank you.

19
00:01:13,342 --> 00:01:16,462
Oh, wait a minute.
You got a little shmutz.

20
00:01:18,294 --> 00:01:23,625
Did she just spit on that tissue
and rub it on his face?

21
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,404
I brushed.

22
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:29,732
Okay, off you go.
Good luck on your math test.

23
00:01:29,732 --> 00:01:32,574
What's six times twelve?
/ Seventy-two.

24
00:01:32,574 --> 00:01:35,567
Yeah, that sounds right.

25
00:01:37,448 --> 00:01:39,342
Does my hair look okay?
/ You're beautiful.

26
00:01:39,342 --> 00:01:42,579
But let's save this for
when you need a facelift.

27
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:46,207
There.  That's much softer.

28
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:47,656
Very pretty.

29
00:01:47,656 --> 00:01:50,474
Oh, and my headache's gone.

30
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:55,709
And you have fun in
school today, Gracie.

31
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:58,482
How can I when the polar
ice caps are melting?

32
00:01:58,482 --> 00:02:03,050
Oh, don't worry about it.
I put a snorkel in your lunch box.

33
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,762
Now everyone, say goodbye to Daddy.
/ Goodbye.

34
00:02:05,762 --> 00:02:08,736
Daddy?  Did I miss the wedding?

35
00:02:08,736 --> 00:02:11,884
That twitch becomes you.
Is it new?

36
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:17,630
Oh. Let me fix your tie.

37
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,290
Oh, no good?
I was trying a double Windsor.

38
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,997
Churchill wore one you know.
/ Oh, he must have been hiding a goiter.

39
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:27,512
Does Donna Reed ever give it a rest?

40
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:29,233
Excuse me.

41
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:33,586
I have some pies I need to
cool on the windowsill.

42
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:42,795
Well, Nanny Fine has certainly
made herself at home.

43
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:45,610
Yes, yes.  She's proving to be
an absolute treasure.

44
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,305
How lucky for us all
that you dug her up.

45
00:02:49,305 --> 00:02:52,055
I just hope the children
aren't getting too attached.

46
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:55,426
She is the nanny, C.C.
That's kind of the point.

47
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:59,666
Yes, but lately I feel like I haven't
spent any time with you and the children.

48
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,912
C.C., you've never spent any time
with me and the children.

49
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:04,852
Why dwell in the past?

50
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:08,412
Well, tomorrow is Miss Fine's
day off.  We could go to the zoo.

51
00:03:08,412 --> 00:03:12,830
The zoo?  How marvelous.

52
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,252
We'll be like one big happy family.
You and me.

53
00:03:16,252 --> 00:03:19,348
And the children. / Oh, of course.
That goes without saying.

54
00:03:19,348 --> 00:03:22,663
C.C., this is a side of you
that's rather unexpected.

55
00:03:22,663 --> 00:03:25,473
Maxwell, I adore children.

56
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:28,745
It's a natural thing.
A female thing.

57
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:32,156
I hear some females
eat their young.

58
00:04:27,882 --> 00:04:29,796
I don't wanna go to the zoo.

59
00:04:29,796 --> 00:04:34,551
I had nightmares about fangs
and claws and snarling.

60
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:36,709
Gracie, they keep
the animals in cages.

61
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,012
She's talking about C.C.

62
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:43,624
Oh, come on.  Stop being
such a big fat baby.

63
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:45,781
You got a toothache,
you go to a dentist.

64
00:04:45,781 --> 00:04:49,242
I don't have a toothache.
Just slept on it wrong.

65
00:04:49,242 --> 00:04:51,197
Who sleeps on a tooth?

66
00:04:51,197 --> 00:04:54,720
Unless you're waiting for a fairy.

67
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,428
Now open up, let me take a look.

68
00:04:56,428 --> 00:04:58,245
Miss Fine, it's my mouth.

69
00:04:58,245 --> 00:05:00,266
I reserve the right
to keep it shut.

70
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,669
An option you might consider
from time to time.

71
00:05:04,558 --> 00:05:07,393
All right, but what are you gonna
do when all your teeth fall out?

72
00:05:07,393 --> 00:05:10,901
I assume I'll me
masticating for him.

73
00:05:11,985 --> 00:05:15,388
I hope you get time and
half for that one.

74
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:20,005
Why is this water
so blasted cold?

75
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:22,303
It's the polar ice cap!

76
00:05:24,954 --> 00:05:28,495
Now you see what happens when
you neglect dental hygiene?

77
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,893
Miss Fine, isn't this your
day off? / Do you have to go?

78
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:34,346
Well, I'd much rather
be with you, angel,

79
00:05:34,346 --> 00:05:38,028
but I gotta be bridesmaid
to my second cousin, once removed.

80
00:05:38,028 --> 00:05:41,620
And believe me, she was
removed for a reason.

81
00:05:43,325 --> 00:05:47,144
Miss Babcock, I presume.

82
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:51,180
Good morning, children.
Good morning, Maxwell.

83
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,630
C.C., don't you look smashing?

84
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,397
Banana Republic?

85
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,825
Abercrombie and Fitch, dear.

86
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:02,039
All right,
so you paid double.

87
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,454
Well then, we're
off to the zoo.

88
00:06:04,454 --> 00:06:07,278
One second, Maxwell.
You have some crumbs.

89
00:06:07,278 --> 00:06:10,533
Ow! / What?  I did
it just like she did.

90
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:13,961
That's it, no zoo for you.
You're going to see a dentist.

91
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:16,822
Oh, I remember a customer
in the bridal shop.

92
00:06:16,822 --> 00:06:19,723
She had a toothache,
turned into an abscess,

93
00:06:19,723 --> 00:06:21,758
the infection got into
the blood stream.

94
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:25,075
By the end of the honeymoon,
they buried her.

95
00:06:25,075 --> 00:06:27,279
Who's got the butter?

96
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,990
I'm fine.  Besides, dentists
don't work on Saturdays.

97
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,893
Oh yeah?  Well, I got an
Uncle Myron... / How did I know?

98
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:38,286
Don't laugh.  He's built an entire
practice on availability alone.

99
00:06:38,286 --> 00:06:41,058
Miss Fine, the children were
counting on going to the zoo.

100
00:06:41,058 --> 00:06:44,392
Well, Miss Babcock can
still take them.

101
00:06:46,076 --> 00:06:49,722
This is just how
my nightmare started.

102
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,902
Oh yeah, remind me to do that anytime
soon. / Just shut-up, Brighton!

103
00:07:00,902 --> 00:07:04,272
There you're home.
Are you happy?

104
00:07:04,272 --> 00:07:07,901
Niles, get me anything
and make it a double.

105
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:10,886
We'll look who's out of Africa.

106
00:07:10,886 --> 00:07:15,032
I take it the natives were restless.
/ Oh no, we had a marvelous time.

107
00:07:15,032 --> 00:07:19,343
I think the highlight was when
Brighton threw up in my helmet.

108
00:07:19,343 --> 00:07:23,899
Oh, and it's so tricky getting
vomit out of pith.

109
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:26,253
Try baking soda.

110
00:07:26,253 --> 00:07:29,814
Fran told you not to let me
have junk food. / You insisted.

111
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:32,457
Who listens to a ten-year old?

112
00:07:32,457 --> 00:07:34,829
We didn't even go
to the petting zoo.

113
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,301
Is it my fault your sister had to
stop at every bathroom?

114
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:41,157
She must have a bladder
the size of a walnut!

115
00:07:41,157 --> 00:07:43,457
Fran says it's not small.

116
00:07:43,457 --> 00:07:45,553
It's just tilted.

117
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:49,497
I don't care if it's mounted
on a gyroscope.

118
00:07:49,497 --> 00:07:54,693
All day long, it's Fran, Fran, Fran.
If I hear the 'F' word one more time...

119
00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:57,036
Fran enjoys spending time with us.

120
00:07:57,036 --> 00:08:01,703
Fran enjoys spending..  Let me tell
you something about your beloved nanny.

121
00:08:01,703 --> 00:08:05,775
She gets paid to spend time
with you.  I did it for nothing!

122
00:08:05,775 --> 00:08:09,530
That's not true!  Fran loves us!
/ Gracie...

123
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:14,640
By the way, I also
threw up in your purse.

124
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:21,579
So next week
"Chuck E. Cheese"?

125
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,918
Hey, Ma, I look like
Pat Boone's mistress.

126
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:36,636
God forbid you should
outshine the bride.

127
00:08:36,636 --> 00:08:39,355
Really, is it my fault
she's a size eighteen?

128
00:08:39,355 --> 00:08:43,215
Did I shove the donuts
in her mouth?

129
00:08:43,215 --> 00:08:46,974
No.  She was always
jealous of you.

130
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,224
What are you doing?
/ Putting polish on my runs.

131
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:55,849
Well, you're supposed to use clear.
That looks like somebody bit you.

132
00:08:57,234 --> 00:09:00,135
I should be so lucky.

133
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:02,079
Zip me up.

134
00:09:02,944 --> 00:09:05,349
Oh, too tight?

135
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:10,861
oh, I don't know about
these straps, Ma.

136
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:17,161
You look like a ham.

137
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:23,731
The salesgirl said
I looked like a dream.

138
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:28,009
Maybe Oscar Meyers.

139
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:31,288
She should choke
on her commission.

140
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:34,674
Ah, it's six o'clock.
Comb your father's hair.

141
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:39,186
Morty, we're leaving
without you!

142
00:09:41,768 --> 00:09:45,475
Part it on the right.
It stays better in the wind.

143
00:09:46,884 --> 00:09:50,393
On the left is better.
One eye is smaller.

144
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:54,553
Be a doll, get my shoes.

145
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:59,028
Okay.  I never...
You know, Ma,

146
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:02,537
if you wore leather
your feet wouldn't sweat.

147
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,681
I should pay top dollar for shoes
I'm only gonna wear once.

148
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:13,077
Nineteen ninety-five.

149
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:15,573
Oh, they're perfect.

150
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:19,303
Oh, they're like rocks.

151
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:23,646
Take the hair into your father
before the glue dries.

152
00:10:23,646 --> 00:10:26,286
Oy, too late.

153
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:29,018
Who's that?

154
00:10:29,888 --> 00:10:32,797
Oh, it's Gracie.
Ma, it's Gracie.

155
00:10:32,797 --> 00:10:34,984
Honey, what are you doing here?

156
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:37,849
I was in the neighborhood.

157
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:41,405
Isn't she adorable?

158
00:10:41,405 --> 00:10:44,841
You want a scooter pie?

159
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:49,834
That's your first question?

160
00:10:50,414 --> 00:10:53,332
How did you get here?
What's the matter?

161
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:57,275
I missed you.
/ Oh, well I missed you too, honey.

162
00:10:57,275 --> 00:11:00,113
But you're supposed
to be at the zoo with C.C.

163
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:02,107
Maybe she's allergic.
You know,

164
00:11:02,107 --> 00:11:07,096
your Uncle Marvin was allergic
to peacocks. There are no shots for that.

165
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:14,181
Ma, I see your lips moving, but I
have no idea what you're talking about.

166
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:19,958
Where's your father?
How did you get here?

167
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,523
I ran away.  I took a limo.

168
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,572
I ran away.  I took a banana.

169
00:11:30,305 --> 00:11:31,817
Are you mad at me?

170
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:35,667
No, angel, but who runs
from Park Avenue to Flushing?

171
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:39,084
Honey, you're running
in the wrong direction.

172
00:11:39,084 --> 00:11:40,958
She's running to you.

173
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:46,534
Oh, isn't this the sweetest
thing I ever heard.

174
00:11:46,534 --> 00:11:49,233
Now I know the love of a child.

175
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:52,724
You could get fired from all
this love. / Why?  What did I do?

176
00:11:52,724 --> 00:11:58,942
She's too emotionally attached to you.
/ Oh, she is not.  I'm her nanny.

177
00:11:58,942 --> 00:12:02,862
Meanwhile, I have a girl who
comes twice a week to clean.

178
00:12:02,862 --> 00:12:08,194
If she left tomorrow,
would I take a limo to Haiti?

179
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:19,991
I'm telling you,
it's not normal.

180
00:12:20,548 --> 00:12:24,831
Keep it up, Ma.  The kid's
dolls are in therapy.

181
00:12:33,374 --> 00:12:36,053
Darling, you're home.
How was the dentist?

182
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,027
I think you have
a mouth full of cotton.

183
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:45,805
Oh, right.  Oh, hey, I had to
take this out when I got home.

184
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:48,100
Niles.

185
00:12:48,979 --> 00:12:52,918
Oh, goody.  Five more of these
and I'll have a sweater.

186
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:55,083
How's the pain, Maxwell?

187
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,874
Uncle Myron filled me with so much
novocaine, it could bring down an elephant.

188
00:12:58,874 --> 00:13:02,854
Then went on about his grandson,
Robbie, the tap dancing genius.

189
00:13:02,854 --> 00:13:05,241
I kept begging for the gas.

190
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:07,709
How was your day?  It has to
have been better than mine.

191
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:11,603
Oh, the children and I had
a marvelous time. We're much closer now.

192
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:14,538
Yes.  She really got Brighton
to spill his guts.

193
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,497
Here, darling, have another cookie.

194
00:13:20,497 --> 00:13:22,834
Ma, enough.  She's gonna pop.

195
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:24,727
Oh, let me spoil her.

196
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:29,129
At the rate you're going, this
could be my only grandchild.

197
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:31,682
Sheffield residence.
/ Hiya, Niles.

198
00:13:31,682 --> 00:13:33,047
Hello, Miss Fine.

199
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:36,588
How'd you know it was me?
/ Just a shot in the dark.

200
00:13:37,673 --> 00:13:40,522
Do me a favor, put the boss on.

201
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:43,994
Niles, didn't say boo.
They have no idea she's missing.

202
00:13:43,994 --> 00:13:45,684
Here, try the Entemann's.

203
00:13:45,684 --> 00:13:48,023
Stop forcing food down her throat.

204
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:52,311
She's not a goose.
We're not making pate.

205
00:13:53,222 --> 00:13:54,502
Hello, Miss Fine.

206
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:57,565
Oh, how are you, Mister Sheffield?
Is everything okay?

207
00:13:57,565 --> 00:14:01,727
Oh, everything's splendid.  C.C.
and the children had a marvelous time.

208
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:06,244
Uh-huh.  Well, let me talk to Gracie?
/ You wanna speak to Gracie?

209
00:14:06,244 --> 00:14:09,125
I'll fetch her.
/ I'll go.

210
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,871
C.C.'s going upstairs to look
for you right now.

211
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:15,455
Well she won't find me.
/ That's right.

212
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:19,907
Frankly I had my doubts about C.C.,
but it seems she's full of surprises.

213
00:14:19,907 --> 00:14:25,105
Uh-huh.  Wait.  She's a regular
box of Cracker Jack.

214
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:27,492
You know, in a way, she's a good
influence on the children.

215
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:31,210
Well, they can be wild sometimes,
and she's so poised and collected.

216
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,776
She's gone!
/ What?!

217
00:14:32,776 --> 00:14:33,810
She's gone.

218
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,939
What do you mean she's gone?
Where the devil is she?

219
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:39,177
I'm not sure.  I'm almost positive
she came home with us.

220
00:14:39,177 --> 00:14:42,367
Well, well, don't you know?
C.C., she was in your care!

221
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:45,053
Well, she could have sneaked
out without my seeing her.

222
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:48,179
She is very small.

223
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,147
I have to call the police.
/ Hi, Daddy.

224
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:54,375
Grace, get off the phone.
I have to call...

225
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:57,300
Gracie, you're there?

226
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,826
I'll be right there.
I'm leaving now.

227
00:14:58,826 --> 00:15:01,588
No.  So are we.  You'll have to
meet us at the wedding.

228
00:15:01,588 --> 00:15:07,867
Go to Leonard's on Astoria boulevard.
Park in the car wash, ask for
the Mishkin affair.  Bye.

229
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:21,919
L'Chaim!

230
00:15:24,906 --> 00:15:27,876
Oh look, Gracie,

231
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:32,543
Jeffrey Mishkin's
giving you the eye.

232
00:15:32,543 --> 00:15:35,538
Why don't you go have fun, angel?

233
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:38,404
And don't mention
global warming.

234
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:42,570
Chicken.

235
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,208
For this I gave
a fifty-dollar check.

236
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:50,482
You should have given them
a bond, mad them wait.

237
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,155
Oh, Mister Sheffield,
over here.

238
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,941
Who's the park ranger?

239
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,058
That's his business associate.
/ Uh-huh.

240
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:05,027
She wishes.

241
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:08,274
So, Mister Sheffield, hi.
You remember my mother.

242
00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:12,201
Mrs. Fine, charmed.
/ That makes two of us.

243
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:16,088
I'd like you to meet
my husband.  Morty!

244
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:19,689
God, it's hereditary.

245
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:23,469
That's nothing.  On my father's side,
they all have webbed toes,

246
00:16:23,469 --> 00:16:26,215
but excellent swimmers.

247
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:30,375
Sylvia Fine.
/ C.C. Babcock.  How do you do?

248
00:16:30,694 --> 00:16:33,333
Like a fish.
/ Hm-hmm.

249
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:37,533
Excuse me.
I have to bring Morty a plate.

250
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:41,708
No skin.  No butter.
No sauce.

251
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,247
Mr. Gandhi ate better that that.

252
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:49,315
Better he should drop dead on me?
Like I'd notice.

253
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,145
Hi, Daddy.

254
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:56,982
Sweetheart, oh you scared
me half to death.

255
00:16:56,982 --> 00:17:00,827
We were worried sick.
/ You didn't even know she was missing.

256
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:04,212
Well, I would have been
worried sick had I known.

257
00:17:04,212 --> 00:17:07,288
Honey, what happened.
Why, why did you run away?

258
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:08,438
Well...

259
00:17:08,438 --> 00:17:12,703
Oh, it doesn't matter why.
All that matters is she's okay.

260
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:17,359
C, C.C., you're
smothering the child.

261
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,488
She won't be happy till
she's finished her off.

262
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:24,628
Gracie, dear, go and get your coat
and we'll discuss this at home.

263
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:29,437
But I don't wanna go home.
After they cut the cake we're having Schnapps.

264
00:17:29,437 --> 00:17:31,550
That sounds delightful.

265
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,272
But you see, to...,
today is Miss Fine's day off.

266
00:17:34,272 --> 00:17:37,430
And, well, we wouldn't
want to intrude.

267
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:41,005
So then it's true.
/ What's true, angel?

268
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:45,296
That you only spend time with me
because Daddy pays you to.

269
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:51,734
What kind of a vicious cold-hearted
imbecile would say something like that?

270
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:59,595
Well, I meant it
in the nicest possible way.

271
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:01,194
Oh, C.C.!

272
00:18:01,194 --> 00:18:03,611
Sheffield!
/ Oh God, Uncle Myron.

273
00:18:03,611 --> 00:18:05,638
The nightmare continues.

274
00:18:05,638 --> 00:18:08,792
I want you to meet
my grandson.  Robbie.

275
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:11,136
Myron, not now.
/ Hit it!

276
00:18:11,136 --> 00:18:15,474
Laugh and cheer up,
put on a happy face.

277
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:17,891
*********************

278
00:18:17,891 --> 00:18:19,713
Well, they were
all ganging up on me.

279
00:18:19,713 --> 00:18:22,234
So you take it out on
a six-year old. / She started it.

280
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,862
Oh, that's very mature.
/ Well, that's the pot calling the kettle black.

281
00:18:25,862 --> 00:18:28,695
Now come on, let's move on.
The important thing is so put on a happy...

282
00:18:28,695 --> 00:18:31,097
Will you shut-up!

283
00:18:32,157 --> 00:18:34,436
Well, that was only slightly
more painful than the toothache.

284
00:18:34,436 --> 00:18:37,404
Meanwhile, what about
poor little... Where's Grace?

285
00:18:37,404 --> 00:18:39,037
Well she was right here.

286
00:18:39,037 --> 00:18:42,131
See?  And you both
jumped down my throat!

287
00:18:42,131 --> 00:18:43,346
Gracie?

288
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:45,558
Looking for something?
/ Yeah.

289
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:49,436
If she's three foot two
and not a Jew,

290
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:55,083
she's in the powder room crying
her little eyes out.

291
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:59,254
Oh, I better go talk to her.
/ No, Miss Fine, she's my daughter.
I'll talk to her.

292
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:04,823
Maybe you better talk to her.

293
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,730
Creep!

294
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:11,636
Gracie?

295
00:19:11,636 --> 00:19:13,862
I'm never coming out.

296
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,929
Oh, honey,

297
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:22,195
aren't you getting a little claustrophobic
in that teeny-weeny stall?

298
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:26,327
C'mere baby.

299
00:19:26,327 --> 00:19:31,697
Oy, one day with my mother and
you're ready for Jennie Craig.

300
00:19:31,697 --> 00:19:36,170
Honey, I want you to listen to
me very carefully, okay?

301
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,292
Okay.
/ All right.

302
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:42,807
It's true, I do get paid
to take care of you.

303
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:47,598
But I don't get paid extra
for loving you.  And I do.

304
00:19:47,598 --> 00:19:50,278
I love you, too.

305
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:54,382
Oy, let's face it, Grace,
I'm no Ivana Trump.

306
00:19:54,382 --> 00:19:57,593
Of course, neither is she anymore.

307
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:05,345
I got on lousy Christmas Club account
with maybe forty-nine cents in it,
so I gotta work for a living.

308
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:10,641
Lucky for me I got the best job
in the whole wide world.  I love you.

309
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:13,163
And you don't just do it for the money?

310
00:20:13,163 --> 00:20:15,966
Believe me, by the time
they take out state,

311
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:21,963
and federal, and FICA,
it's a labor of love.

312
00:20:21,963 --> 00:20:24,942
Let's see, what d'we look like here?

313
00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:27,655
Oh, yuk, I'm a mess.

314
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:33,309
What's Jeffrey Mishkin gonna think?
I'm all puffy.

315
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:35,648
Honey, he's gonna think
you're gorgeous.

316
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:38,960
Now you'll first look
like his mother.

317
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,941
Grace, are you all right?

318
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,548
Through pain comes growth.

319
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:49,347
What? / She's fine.

320
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:51,252
Thank you.

321
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:55,617
My pleasure.
Go, dance with your daughter.

322
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:05,732
All I wanted to do was have
the children like me.

323
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:10,820
I try so hard to be loving
and sensitive and fun.

324
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:17,145
I can also juggle.
/ Beat it you untalented little troll!

325
00:21:20,157 --> 00:21:23,979
You are a regular Mister Rogers.

326
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:29,707
Look, I can understand that
you're incredibly threatened by me.

327
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:33,373
Yes, even in this dress.

328
00:21:34,077 --> 00:21:38,255
However, it doesn't mean that
we can't all live under one roof.

329
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,722
Oh, that's right,
you don't live with us.

330
00:21:41,722 --> 00:21:43,334
Your point?

331
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:47,303
Look, you're a lovely woman,
and I wish you well.

332
00:21:47,303 --> 00:21:52,372
But if you ever hurt one of my kids again,
they'll be wiping your blue blood off the walls.

333
00:21:52,372 --> 00:21:56,755
And I mean that in
the nicest possible way.

334
00:21:58,722 --> 00:22:00,440
Pardon me.

335
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,251
Ma, what are you doing?

336
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:07,043
Why shouldn't I have
a little centerpiece?

337
00:22:09,268 --> 00:22:13,410
But they haven't even cut the cake yet.
You're already taking the flowers?

338
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:17,823
Well, for my fifty dollars,
I should get something.

339
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:24,515
Look, Ma, she's standing on his shoes.
Is that the cutest thing you ever saw?

340
00:22:24,515 --> 00:22:26,446
Adorable.

341
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:28,986
Go cut in.

342
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:42,865
...when thoughts
a gloomy mask of tragedy,

343
00:22:42,865 --> 00:22:45,402
it's not your style,

344
00:22:45,402 --> 00:22:51,721
so put on a happy face.

345
00:22:51,721 --> 00:22:54,420
Great.  One more time.

346
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,068
Grey skies are gonna clear up.

347
00:22:57,068 --> 00:23:00,001
Put on a happy face...



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
