1
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,709
Good afternoon. 
/ Hi, Mr. Sheffield.

2
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:13,362
Maxwell, if you don't jump on this, 
someone else will. / Oh, she's bluffing, sir.

3
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:18,173
I am talking about using 
our company profits

4
00:00:18,173 --> 00:00:21,747
to buy a dreamy little vacation 
house on Martha's Vineyard.

5
00:00:21,747 --> 00:00:24,764
I can just see myself lying 
on the beach for days ...

6
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:29,475
Oh, I'm sure someone would tow you out 
to sea if your blow hole got clogged.

7
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:32,967
Cee Cee, I am not about to
 make such a large investment

8
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:35,468
without exploring
 all the options first.

9
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:40,791
Oh, I'm with you.  My father once invested 
in one of those big tall men shops.

10
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,128
Oh, well, now those 
are very successful.

11
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:46,613
Not the one in Tokyo.

12
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:48,502
Fran, I'm ready to pick up guys.

13
00:00:48,502 --> 00:00:51,611
Groceries, honey, groceries.

14
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:55,069
Kids.  I don't know where
 they pick these things up from.

15
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:58,034
Miss Fine, you wouldn't seriously
 consider dating some total stranger

16
00:00:58,034 --> 00:01:00,176
you picked up in a grocery
 store, would you?

17
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:02,492
Well, it's a fancy 
Park Avenue market.

18
00:01:02,492 --> 00:01:06,455
I mean it's not as if I'm going 
to a mini-mart at a gas station.

19
00:01:06,455 --> 00:01:08,856
Although Val did meet
 a guy there once,

20
00:01:08,856 --> 00:01:13,171
but he only used her
 as a human shield.

21
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:17,273
Okay.  Anybody need anything?

22
00:01:17,273 --> 00:01:19,343
No, thanks, I do 
my shopping late at night.

23
00:01:19,343 --> 00:01:24,006
Makes sense.  If a man's hungry enough,
 any old thing looks good.

24
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:17,545
Oh, honey, honey, honey,
 go easy on the candy.

25
00:02:17,545 --> 00:02:19,362
Your teeth are going
 to fall out.

26
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:21,537
Fran, baby teeth are 
supposed to fall out.

27
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:23,937
God made them that way 
so that kids could eat

28
00:02:23,937 --> 00:02:26,017
all the sugar they want
 and be happy.

29
00:02:26,017 --> 00:02:32,470
Nice try.  Meanwhile, if God waas so benevolent,
 when you turned 30, your hips would fall off.

30
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:36,857
Everything you need to know about a man,
 you can find right in his cart.

31
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:40,524
If there's a box of Midol,
 keep moving.

32
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:46,173
Corn pads means he lives with his mother,
 learned that the hard way.

33
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:51,289
And if you see two guys with sweaters tied 
around their necks buying pesto,

34
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:54,927
save yourself the pain.

35
00:02:54,927 --> 00:02:56,802
What about him?

36
00:02:56,802 --> 00:03:01,247
Um, let's see, cabbage,
 chili, refried beans,

37
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:06,939
oh, one dinner with him and you'd spend 
the rest of the night blaming the dog.

38
00:03:12,783 --> 00:03:15,955
Oh, excuse me.

39
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:20,413
This is, this is probably 
a stupid question

40
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:24,399
because obviously you've never 
been on a diet in your life.

41
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:27,893
Oh, me, hardly.

42
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:31,706
Get rid of the Dexatrim.

43
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:34,957
Are these fat free cakes any good?

44
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:38,283
Oh, they're delish, you know,
 you smear them with some butter

45
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:40,779
and then you fry them lightly
 on both sides

46
00:03:40,779 --> 00:03:45,202
and then a squirt of whipped cream 
puts it right over the top.

47
00:03:45,202 --> 00:03:49,306
Personally, I like whipped 
cream on everything.

48
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:53,295
Oh, ha.

49
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,844
Well, I'd be happy to give you
 a recipe for your wife.

50
00:03:57,844 --> 00:04:00,573
I'm not married.

51
00:04:00,928 --> 00:04:05,309
Fran, can we get these sugar... 
/ Knock yourself out, honey.

52
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,824
That's a cute daughter 
you have there.

53
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:14,159
Oh, I'm not her mother. 
 I'm Fran, her single nanny.

54
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,566
Hi. /  Hi.

55
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:17,123
Glen. / Hi, Glen.

56
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:22,686
Well, let's see.  I see bacon,
 pork rinds, Virginia ham.

57
00:04:22,686 --> 00:04:26,994
Well, I know one thing,
 you're not a rabbi.

58
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:29,471
My cover is blown ...

59
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:31,839
You've got a great smile.

60
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,662
Fran, what about these... 
/ Yeah, go for it, babe.

61
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:41,224
So we ruled out rabbi, and 
I can tell you're not a lawyer

62
00:04:41,224 --> 00:04:43,039
Why can't I pass as a lawyer?

63
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:47,471
Well, not in New York, 
I mean, maybe L.A.

64
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:52,835
I work an Wall Street. 
/ Oh, a stockbroker.

65
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:56,782
So what's the matter?  Can't stay
 away from the market?

66
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:02,563
Fran, this one comes with a prize. 
 I got lucky.

67
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:04,859
You and me both.

68
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:14,011
Um, Niles, you have really 
outdone yourself this time.

69
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:18,060
Thank you, sir.  
Another pop tart?

70
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,533
No, but I could go for some more of
 those leprechaun things.

71
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:27,748
They are magically delicious.

72
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:31,586
Um, look at this great picture 
of Marylou Retin.

73
00:05:31,586 --> 00:05:35,024
I think it's actual size.

74
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,812
So, Miss Fine, where are you 
off to on your day off?

75
00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:42,088
I'm going to the Hamptons 
for a lobster lunch

76
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:47,953
with the man that I met at the grocery
 -- told you so -- store.

77
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:51,035
And how exactly did 
he win your heart?

78
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:54,256
That immortal line, 
"paper or plastic"?

79
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:58,083
Oh, no, he's no box boy, 
much higher.

80
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:01,291
Does he use a hose?

81
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,049
That depends on how hot we get.

82
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:12,159
Hi, Daddy; bye, Daddy.

83
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:15,605
Well, I guess the breakfast
 just kicked in.

84
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:22,362
Oh, man, this is really scary.  
I'm dressed just like Snap.

85
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:25,829
Val once dated a guy that
 looked like Crackle.

86
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:29,814
Unfortunately, he popped too quick ...

87
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:38,895
Oh, that must be Glen, my stockbroker 
from the grocery store.

88
00:06:38,895 --> 00:06:42,667
Niles, my butler from England,
 will answer it.

89
00:06:43,715 --> 00:06:45,391
How do you like this outfit?

90
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:47,495
That's nice.  You look very festive.

91
00:06:47,495 --> 00:06:51,682
Festive?  Carmen Miranda is festive.

92
00:06:51,682 --> 00:06:55,386
Ms. Fine, you forgot your hat.

93
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,528
I'd like you to meet Glen Mitchell
 the stock.../ the stockbroker.

94
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:03,160
This is my boss, Maxwell Sheffield.
 / How do you do?

95
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,726
The Broadway producer.

96
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:10,406
This is an honor.  I, I, I saw your 
last play six times. / Really?

97
00:07:10,406 --> 00:07:13,782
Even the family only had 
to sit through it twice...

98
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:18,344
And the second time was even better.

99
00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:22,382
I think you had to see it more than once
 to fully comprehend the metaphor.

100
00:07:22,382 --> 00:07:26,491
What metaphor? 
/ Adam and Eve, original sin.

101
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:32,504
I mean, that's why she never 
ate the ribs; right?

102
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:37,397
God, that's clever. 
 I missed that.

103
00:07:37,615 --> 00:07:39,650
I, I thought it was brilliant.

104
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:44,417
Yeah, me too.  Meanwhile, there's a six-pound
 lobster getting his affairs in order.  Bye.

105
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:46,824
Is that a Robert Graham?

106
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:50,795
Yes, yes, it is. He's one of 
my favorite sculptors. / Mine too?

107
00:07:50,795 --> 00:07:56,182
I love him.  Didn't he design that beer mug
 where you drink out of the nipple?

108
00:07:56,874 --> 00:08:01,497
You know, I have the companion piece of that
 up in the bedroom.  Would you like to see it?

109
00:08:01,497 --> 00:08:04,054
I'll bet it's worth twice 
what you paid for it.

110
00:08:04,054 --> 00:08:06,778
If it is, I'll sell it to you.

111
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,788
Well, it's so nice that the three 
of us are getting closer.

112
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:15,171
My cousin Merrill's husband 
had a friend named Sam.

113
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:18,436
The three of them did 
everything together,

114
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:21,036
except Merrill wasn't 
much of a dancer

115
00:08:21,036 --> 00:08:25,807
so sometimes the two guys would 
go out together -- hey.

116
00:08:31,617 --> 00:08:34,686
Cee Cee, we are not investing
 in a summer home.

117
00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:37,071
Now Glen mentioned
 a fabulous stock.

118
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:39,666
That's where we should put our
 company's profits.

119
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:44,202
But, Maxwell, look at this 
Martha's Vineyard house.

120
00:08:44,202 --> 00:08:47,327
There's even a servants' 
shack behind the dune.

121
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:51,902
We can keep Niles there when 
he's not waiting on us.

122
00:08:52,273 --> 00:08:54,529
Lemon cake? / Please ...

123
00:08:58,723 --> 00:09:04,150
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, Brighten is really upset
 about this whole Rice Krispie elf resemblance thing

124
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,151
so I'm taking him downtown shopping. 
 He wants a whole new look.

125
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:10,628
Oh, it's just a stage, Miss Fine.

126
00:09:10,628 --> 00:09:14,178
When I was his age, I was 
a bit of a rebel myself.

127
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:18,170
Oh, what'd you wear?  
Brown socks and black shoes?

128
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,239
Sometimes.

129
00:09:20,588 --> 00:09:23,380
Once I wore my dickie backwards

130
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,114
and no one knew. 
/ Watch out.

131
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:35,214
Hello.  Oh, hello, Glen. / Oh, boy, is 
he an eager beaver.  Hand it over.

132
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:37,561
Thank you for getting back to me.

133
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:41,007
I just wanted to call and say how much
 I enjoyed our squash game.

134
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:46,202
And my partner and I are very 
intrigued by that stock tip.

135
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:49,044
My partner and I are very intrigued 
by that stock tip.

136
00:09:49,044 --> 00:09:53,209
Listen, I'll come by the club later
 on and bring you a check.  Uh-huh.

137
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:55,656
Yes, Fran's right here.

138
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,493
Glen says hello.  Oh, and by the way, 
thank you for introducing us.

139
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:06,650
Oh, and my pleasure, and where are you 
registered? Do you need a nice punch bowl?

140
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:13,948
Come on, Gloomy, keep up.

141
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:17,200
Viper and the hounds.

142
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,012
Oh, honey, I think you should hike up
 your pants a little bit.

143
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:24,736
No, Fran, this is cool. 
/ No, honey, this is the Maytag repairman.

144
00:10:25,697 --> 00:10:29,241
How about a nice hot dog? 
 I'm thinking sour crout, red onions --

145
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:30,716
Oh, and a little mayonaise.

146
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:33,749
Okay, you can have your own.

147
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:39,160
No, honey, I'm telling you,
 this is Gomer;

148
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,484
this is Goober.  This is cool.

149
00:10:42,707 --> 00:10:46,784
Can I help you -- boy.

150
00:10:46,784 --> 00:10:49,830
Oh, my God.

151
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,046
You're a hot dog vendor?

152
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:56,712
That's not even Kosher.

153
00:11:01,432 --> 00:11:09,384
Oh, Niles, I am responsible for Mr. Sheffield
 investing his money with a hot dog vendor.

154
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:13,360
I'll be in my room.  Weeeee!

155
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:19,741
Not to mention getting his kid
 hooked own riboflavin.

156
00:11:20,218 --> 00:11:23,836
Oh, this is the worst trouble
 I have ever been in.

157
00:11:23,836 --> 00:11:28,705
Ever since the time I corn wrote
 my father's toupe.

158
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:32,926
Thank God he knew all the lyrics
 to "Sunshine of My Life."

159
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,677
Well, you could always get Mr. Sheffield's
 business manager to sell the stocks.

160
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:40,419
Oh, Niles, you're a genius. 
 Who's his business manager?

161
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:44,760
No, no, I don't think you know 
who you're talking to.

162
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,867
I've got lawyers; I've got money, 
and I know where you live.

163
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:53,199
You will rue the day you 
crossed CeeCee Babcock.

164
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:55,857
Bye, Mommy.  Kiss kiss.

165
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,708
Oh, Niles, will you ask her for me?

166
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,665
Oh, she detests me more than you.
 / No way.

167
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:08,777
Way.

168
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:13,466
Maggie, who does Miss Babcock
 hates more?  Me or him?

169
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,753
Oh, God, this is hard.

170
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,262
She hates both your guts.
 / Yeah, but I make her nauseous.

171
00:12:20,262 --> 00:12:23,059
I make her drink.

172
00:12:23,293 --> 00:12:26,764
Look, I don't want to hurt 
anyone's feelings here,

173
00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:29,960
but I'd have to say 
she hates Niles more.

174
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,638
Yes, still No. 1.

175
00:12:35,748 --> 00:12:37,963
Knock, knock.

176
00:12:38,193 --> 00:12:40,520
Miss Babcock,

177
00:12:42,164 --> 00:12:45,216
look, I made you some 
cucumber sandwiches.

178
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:48,116
And I cut all the crust off
 on the bread.

179
00:12:48,116 --> 00:12:53,059
And look, there's even a little
 cherry tomato flower.

180
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,188
I'm dying, aren't I?

181
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:05,768
No, no, of course not.

182
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:08,646
It's just that, well, we spend
 so much time together,

183
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:11,311
I thought that we should be friends.

184
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:16,491
You want something, don't you? 
 Nanny Fine wants something.

185
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:19,495
Oh, yes ...  Yes ...

186
00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:24,342
Oh, God, this is good.

187
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:31,268
Are you done?

188
00:13:32,573 --> 00:13:35,758
You want to have a ciggy butt
 and cuddle now?

189
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,844
Okay, what is it?

190
00:13:39,844 --> 00:13:43,440
Well, remember Glen, the stockbroker?

191
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,874
The one who cost me my beautiful 
vacation house.

192
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:49,748
Did I mention that he said that you 
looked just like Heather Locklear?

193
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:53,888
I never met him.
 / I described you.  He was drooling.

194
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:58,428
Anyway, you're going to get 
a big kick out of this.

195
00:13:58,428 --> 00:14:02,441
Glen, the stockbroker, 
is really --

196
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:08,190
is this thing on -- a hot dog vendor.

197
00:14:11,837 --> 00:14:16,945
I know -- I know, people, right?
  Go figure.

198
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:18,947
So at this very minute,

199
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:21,813
Maxwell is at the Manhattan Men's Club

200
00:14:21,813 --> 00:14:28,408
handing over $100,000 to a hot dog vendor
 you introduced him to.

201
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:32,208
Yes. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

202
00:14:32,547 --> 00:14:35,805
Now, go pick up the phone 
and kill that deal.

203
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:40,229
Here you go.  Pick up the phone.

204
00:14:40,552 --> 00:14:46,280
Just put it in your hand
 and dial the number.

205
00:14:46,644 --> 00:14:50,434
Oh, come on, Miss Babcock.  
It's your money too.

206
00:14:50,804 --> 00:14:56,869
Save a ton of money ... Nanny Fine screwed.
  Whoops.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.

207
00:14:58,366 --> 00:15:02,381
Please, Miss Babcock,
 pick up the phone.

208
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,063
Oh, all right. 
/ Thank you, thank you, thank you.

209
00:15:08,884 --> 00:15:14,409
Hello, Dr. Bort, cancel my therapy session today.
  I don't need it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

210
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:21,690
Guest of Mr. Sheffield.

211
00:15:21,969 --> 00:15:28,081
Sorry.  No women allowed.
 / Well, what is this?  
The heman women haters' club?

212
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:32,704
This is very important. 
 I must speak to Mr. Sheffield. 
 I'm his nanny.

213
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:35,485
Lady, no woman's ever
 gotten into this club

214
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:40,280
and no woman's ever going to
 figure out how. / Huh ...

215
00:16:00,884 --> 00:16:03,046
I thought there were no women allowed?

216
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:05,642
Just the cocktail waitresses, sir.

217
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,438
If I'd known of that, I'd go 
straight to Al Capone.

218
00:16:09,438 --> 00:16:16,154
Excuse me? / I'll have a brandy Alexander, 
skim milk, and put it in a parfait glass.

219
00:16:16,154 --> 00:16:21,435
Ah, listen, that's a, that's 
a lovely shade of blush you're wearing.

220
00:16:22,424 --> 00:16:25,694
You know, chicks like to hear that stuff.

221
00:16:31,497 --> 00:16:38,399
Oh, yeah, Maryanne, ah, cancel my appointment 
with the, ah, professor.

222
00:16:45,282 --> 00:16:47,014
Hey, how you doing?

223
00:16:47,494 --> 00:16:51,712
Hello.  Maxwell Sheffield,
 and, and you are Mr.?

224
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,878
Ed?

225
00:16:56,413 --> 00:16:59,196
Well, Mr. Ed; this is Mr. Mitchell.

226
00:16:59,196 --> 00:17:00,760
You can call me Glen.

227
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,082
Oh, well, you can call me Wilbur.

228
00:17:05,618 --> 00:17:09,447
Oh, Glen here is a stockmarket wiz.

229
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:12,476
Oh, a real hot dog, huh?

230
00:17:14,072 --> 00:17:17,401
As a matter of fact, he gave me
 one hell of a stock tip.

231
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:20,739
Oh, no kidding.
 / Yeah, my nanny turned me on to him.

232
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:24,242
Oh.  Hey, can I talk to him
 for a second? / Yeah.

233
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:28,424
And his nanny turned me on, 
period.  She is hot.

234
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:30,197
Ohhh.  Would you excuse us
 a minute, Glen?

235
00:17:30,197 --> 00:17:33,869
Ah, well, now, Max, it can wait,
 it can wait.

236
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:38,850
Go on, go on. / So, Max, what's 
the story with you and Fran?

237
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,864
Yeah, what's the story 
with you and Fran, Max?

238
00:17:42,055 --> 00:17:48,422
I mean she's a beautiful woman who lives
 in your house haven't you ever been tempted ....

239
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:51,891
Well, to tell you the truth, Glen ... 
/ Here's your brandy Alexander.

240
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:54,220
*********************

241
00:17:55,897 --> 00:17:58,298
Missed it, missed it.  
What'd you say?

242
00:17:58,298 --> 00:18:02,494
Yeah, well, I have her wrapped around 
my little finger, you know. / Oh, yeah?

243
00:18:02,494 --> 00:18:04,943
Oh, yes, I say things to her like

244
00:18:04,943 --> 00:18:09,005
"Oh, but you are so much wiser 
than I am" or,

245
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:14,687
or "The, the children are so much more comfortable
 talking to you," you know, rot like that.

246
00:18:14,892 --> 00:18:19,025
I can't believe she hasn't caught on yet.
 / Uh-huh.  She will.

247
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:24,578
Oh, Glen, listen, before I forget, 
here's that check I promised you.

248
00:18:24,578 --> 00:18:28,079
Oh, no, no.  No business
 on club premises.

249
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,525
I'm a Buddist.

250
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:32,768
I don't think this concerns you, 
Wilbur, old boy.

251
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:35,461
Well, I think it does, 
Glen old beef.

252
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:39,307
Now, listen, buddy ...
/ Hey, hey, give me that back.

253
00:18:39,307 --> 00:18:41,164
Gentlemen, please ...

254
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,106
Excuse me.

255
00:18:50,438 --> 00:18:58,944
Hey, hey, give that to me.  Give that to me.
  Give it to me.  Give it to me.  Ahhhhhh ...

256
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,193
Mr. Sheffield, Mr. Sheffield,
 Mr. Sheffield, are you okay?

257
00:19:09,193 --> 00:19:12,899
Wilbur? 
/ No, it's me, Miss Fine.

258
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:18,837
Oh, thank God, for a moment I found 
myself oddly attracted to you.

259
00:19:18,837 --> 00:19:22,609
I thought 20 years in musical theater
 had finally taken its toll on me.

260
00:19:23,273 --> 00:19:25,471
What the, what the hell are you
 doing here dressed like that?

261
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:27,808
Well, it was the only way that 
I could get in.

262
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:32,983
Ah, I came to put an end to this
 thing between you and Glen.

263
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:35,661
Won't you -- won't you keep 
your voice down?

264
00:19:35,661 --> 00:19:37,858
It's all right.  It's all right. 
 We live together.

265
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:41,484
Nothing to see here. 
 Nothing to see here.

266
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:44,331
What a bunch of yentas.

267
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:48,038
Mr. Sheffield, Mr. Sheffield, 
Glen is not a stockbroker.

268
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:51,850
You were about to give $100,000 to
 a man that sells hot dogs.

269
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,696
Hot dogs.  How many?

270
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:58,854
You lied to me. 
/ He lied to both of us.

271
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:02,368
What were you using me
 to get to him?

272
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,191
I don't even know you.

273
00:20:04,191 --> 00:20:09,847
Oh, so I suppose that afternoon 
in the Hamptons meant nothing to you?

274
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,282
Fran?

275
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,338
Oh, I should have known.

276
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:20,461
No chick can eat a whole 
six-pound lobster.

277
00:20:21,297 --> 00:20:26,005
I had a Slim Fast for lunch
 and a sensible dinner.

278
00:20:28,943 --> 00:20:30,959
You said you were a stockbroker.

279
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:35,103
No, I said I worked on Wall Street.

280
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:38,483
Would you have gone out with me
 if I told you that I sold hot dogs?

281
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:41,704
Absolutely.  But now 
all trust is gone.

282
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:45,952
I can't stand a man who pretends
 to be something that he's not.

283
00:20:46,174 --> 00:20:49,029
Yeah, well, just for the record,
 I was a stockbroker.

284
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:54,160
I got killed in the '80s. 
 All I needed was one big client.

285
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:03,357
Maxwell Sheffield was
 the man of my dreams.

286
00:21:07,486 --> 00:21:12,434
Boy, I haven't seen a shiner like
 this since my sister got her nose job.

287
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:16,459
Take it easy.  There. 
/ I'll be back in a moment, sir.

288
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:20,427
I have to run down to the market now
 that dinner is on your face.

289
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,079
Perhaps Miss Fine would like
 to go for you?

290
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:27,296
Maybe she can pick up an ex-doctor
 with his own falafel wagon.

291
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,077
No, thank you.  
I've learned my lesson.

292
00:21:31,077 --> 00:21:34,398
Besides, if I want to meet a doctor, 
I'll do it the old-fashioned way.

293
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:37,712
Fall in love?
 / Faint in temple.

294
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:40,532
What's up, brother man?

295
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,209
You be cool.

296
00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:55,593
Dad, would you get your own stereo?

297
00:21:55,593 --> 00:21:59,340
Five more minutes, I could have been
 in the park with this.

298
00:22:00,348 --> 00:22:04,352
What are we going to do about 
that Brighten-big-pants situation?

299
00:22:04,352 --> 00:22:07,261
Ah, well, I thought that 
you'd talk to him,

300
00:22:07,261 --> 00:22:10,930
you know, you're so much wiser 
than I am, and,

301
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,864
well, the children are just so much 
more comfortable with you,

302
00:22:14,864 --> 00:22:17,477
rot like that.

303
00:22:17,656 --> 00:22:19,169
Blast.

304
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,965
Oh, don't worry, Mr. Sheffield,

305
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:24,921
I have my own phrases
 to manipulate you too.

306
00:22:24,921 --> 00:22:27,725
Really?  Like what?

307
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:32,418
Someone should really talk to that Fergie
 about horizontal stripes.

308
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,864
What -- what phrases?

309
00:22:34,864 --> 00:22:37,616
Oh, I'm just kidding.

310
00:22:37,616 --> 00:22:42,415
Gosh, Mr. Sheffield, I could 
never put anything over on you.

311
00:22:42,415 --> 00:22:47,796
I mean you're a big Broadway 
producer. I'm just a nanny.

312
00:22:47,988 --> 00:22:50,048
Quite right.

313
00:22:50,906 --> 00:22:54,522
Well, No. 17 still works.

314
00:23:05,226 --> 00:23:07,695
I'm off work in an hour.

315
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:09,970
You want to meet me for a drink?

316
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,081
Honey, I got two words for you,

317
00:23:12,081 --> 00:23:14,962
"Crying Game ..."



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
