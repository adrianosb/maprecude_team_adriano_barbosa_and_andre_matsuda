1
00:00:02,182 --> 00:00:05,813
Well, tomorrow's opening night
 and we are completely sold out!

2
00:00:05,813 --> 00:00:08,739
Thank God Miss Fein has 
a large family.

3
00:00:08,739 --> 00:00:14,188
Now all we ... all we need is some good
 reviews and I think we might just have
 another hit on our hands.

4
00:00:14,188 --> 00:00:17,186
Well, I have sent gift baskets 
to every critic in town.

5
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:19,425
Are you telling me you're
 bribing the critics?

6
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:21,664
Trying to buy us a good review?

7
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:23,683
Good thinking.

8
00:00:23,683 --> 00:00:29,407
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, my entire family 
is so excited about being invited 
to opening night.

9
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:33,381
They want twelve chicken dinners, 
two prime ribs and two Kosher meals

10
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:35,531
if it's not too much trouble.

11
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:38,190
Nanny Fein, this is
 not dinner theatre.

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,506
No food?  Oy, big mistake. 
 If you feed them, they will come.

13
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:46,720
Well, if your relatives won't
 come without a feed bag,

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,862
I'll be happy to give them their money 
back and sell their tickets on the street.

15
00:00:49,862 --> 00:00:53,156
I'll drop you off 
at your usual corner.

16
00:00:56,822 --> 00:01:00,235
Miss Fein, I can assure you, 
your relatives are gonna love the play.

17
00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:03,346
It's a brilliant post-modern
 exploration of despair.

18
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:07,830
No food and despair?  Geez, it sounds 
like my Weight Watchers meeting.

19
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,433
Niles, what's all this?

20
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:00,226
Well, I knew you and Miss Grace 
were going to the park.

21
00:02:00,226 --> 00:02:03,729
I thought you might like to take
 a little picnic. / Oh, you doll you.

22
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:08,681
The refrigerator's broken and 
if we don't eat it, it's garbage.

23
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:10,507
Tattle-tale.

24
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:14,566
Well, it sure beats hangin' out on the fire
 escape with a can of franks and beans.

25
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:17,285
You had your picnics 
on the fire escape?

26
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:20,492
Hey, with that menu,
 we were better off outside.

27
00:02:21,722 --> 00:02:24,680
Niles, my little Chester's hungry. 
 Make him something.

28
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,945
Poof.  You're a doberman.  Attack.

29
00:02:27,286 --> 00:02:32,130
Oh, Chester, I haven't seen
 you in such a long time.

30
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,918
Nanny Fein, please. 
 He doesn't like strangers.

31
00:02:38,153 --> 00:02:40,743
C.C., how come your dog hates you?

32
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,597
Well, after all, he is a male.

33
00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:46,253
Not for long.

34
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:50,942
She must get a group rate.

35
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,313
Niles, what's this basket doing here? 
It was supposed to go to Frank Bradley, the critic.

36
00:02:55,313 --> 00:02:59,662
It did.  He sent it back with a snide 
note saying that he couldn't be bought

37
00:02:59,662 --> 00:03:04,300
and if he could, he'd cost more
 than a tin of smoked oysters.

38
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,102
There has got to be some way 
to get to Frank Bradley.

39
00:03:07,102 --> 00:03:10,758
I know a Frank Bradley.  
He's in my arts and crafts class.

40
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:14,875
Maybe that's his son. 
/ He said my ashtray was derivative.

41
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:20,252
That's him. / Oh, I was the queen
 of arts and crafts.

42
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:25,146
Then one day I left my favorite brush 
in the shellac and it hardened overnight.

43
00:03:25,146 --> 00:03:28,562
I just walked away. 
 Never looked back.

44
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:32,201
I have a fun idea.

45
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:37,038
Why don't we call up Frank Junior 
and invite him to go to the park with you?

46
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:39,065
Because I hate him.  
He's a big bully.

47
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:41,584
He's always teasing me 
and calling me names.

48
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:44,847
Oh, you know what they say. 
 Sticks and stones can break my bones,

49
00:03:44,847 --> 00:03:47,136
but bad reviews can kill you.

50
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:52,012
Miss Babcock, she doesn't like the kid.
 You want her to play with someone she doesn't like?

51
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:55,493
Well, if I had to like every one of 
my friends, I wouldn't have any.

52
00:03:57,607 --> 00:04:00,221
I'll flip you for it.

53
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:05,222
Grace dear, Frank's father is going 
to review our play on television

54
00:04:05,222 --> 00:04:08,898
and he can either make it a big
 hit or a big flop.

55
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:14,094
She doesn't play well under pressure. 
/ I'm shutting down.

56
00:04:14,094 --> 00:04:18,052
All right, I'll do it myself.  You must 
have that kid's number somewhere.

57
00:04:18,052 --> 00:04:21,252
Where's all that school junk you're 
always bothering Maxwell with?

58
00:04:21,252 --> 00:04:24,146
Would it be on 
the Pa-Tah phone list?

59
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:27,795
That's P.T.A., Mother Hubbard.

60
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:29,935
Ah!  Here it is.

61
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:32,117
Pa-Tah.  Ha, ha.

62
00:04:35,143 --> 00:04:37,478
Hello, is this Mr. Bradley?

63
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:42,003
We haven't met, but your little Frank
 is in the same class as my Gracie.

64
00:04:42,003 --> 00:04:45,650
I'm not here.  Am I? 
/ No, angel.

65
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,227
You don't shed your skin.

66
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:55,862
It is such a beautiful day and we were wondering
 if little Frank would like to go to the park with Grace.

67
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,979
... Marvelous!

68
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:03,311
You know, there is a brilliant theatre
 critic by the name of Frank Bradley ....

69
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:05,265
You are!?

70
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:08,658
Oh, can that woman ever suck up.

71
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:12,454
If she came with attachments,
 we could throw out the Hoover.

72
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:17,549
C'mon, Gracie, move it along.

73
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:22,003
Freeze.  There's been a change of plans.
 You're taking Frank Bradley, Jr. to the park.

74
00:05:22,003 --> 00:05:24,603
Forget it.  We're goin'
 to the park by ourselves.

75
00:05:24,603 --> 00:05:30,199
I forbid it.
 / Forbid?  Is that the "F" word I hear?

76
00:05:31,657 --> 00:05:35,546
That's the "F" word?
  What's the big deal?

77
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:41,109
Who's the nanny here, anyway? 
/ I was there when this child was born.  
Where were you?

78
00:05:41,109 --> 00:05:43,339
In high school.

79
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:47,982
Ladies, ladies.  Isn't there a more grown-up
 way to settle your differences?

80
00:05:47,982 --> 00:05:50,467
I'm thinking mud wrestling.

81
00:05:51,654 --> 00:05:54,557
Actually, there is a more grown-up way.

82
00:05:54,557 --> 00:05:58,687
I'm telling Maxwell on you.
 / Not if I get there first.  ....

83
00:06:02,485 --> 00:06:04,047
Frank!  Block her!

84
00:06:10,188 --> 00:06:13,823
Well, of course we'd love to have 
Mayor Guiliani there opening night.

85
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:17,577
... But ... but please ask him to
 leave his son at home.

86
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,023
All right, Thigh Master!

87
00:06:24,023 --> 00:06:27,288
Mr. Sheffield, would you 
please explain to Miss Babcock

88
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:29,375
that I am in charge of the children!

89
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,359
Well, of ... of course
 you're in charge.

90
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,943
And if Gracie doesn't want
 to play with a little boy ...

91
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:36,484
she doesn't have to!
 / No, of course not.

92
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:38,831
Miss Babcock, come in.

93
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:42,235
It's Frank Bradley's son.

94
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,866
On the other hand .... 
/ What?

95
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:47,285
Well, it ... it might be good for
 Grace to play with him.

96
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:49,321
But she doesn't like him.

97
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:52,562
Well, how does she know she doesn't like 
him if she doesn't spend any time with him?

98
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:54,272
Ooh, that's good.

99
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:59,010
It ... it's important for Grace to learn
 how to get along with all kinds
 of different people

100
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,156
... even people she doesn't
 particularly care for.

101
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:04,800
Too bad we didn't have this 
conversation out in the garden.

102
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,003
The plants would have loved
 the fertilizer.

103
00:07:14,276 --> 00:07:18,866
C'mon, Frank.  Don't shoot
 at the birds.  Oy.

104
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:21,514
Pow!  Pow!  Pow!

105
00:07:24,764 --> 00:07:28,792
You call this a park? 
 I find it dull.

106
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:32,327
The scenery's totally 
lacking in imagination.

107
00:07:32,861 --> 00:07:35,162
Why did we have to bring him?

108
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:39,831
Well, the more the merrier. Except 
when you're talkin' about chins.

109
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:44,994
My Aunt Miriam had more chins
 than the Chinese phone book.

110
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:49,012
That joke's so old I heard it
 on the "Flintstones."

111
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:53,489
Which, by the way, was a pale 
imitation of "The Honeymooners."

112
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:56,671
His father is a critic. 
 It's hereditary.

113
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,224
I'm bored.  Give me some food 
to feed the squirrels.

114
00:07:59,224 --> 00:08:02,835
You don't need food.  Just lie down
 and make believe you're dead.

115
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:07,445
Oy, does that kid have 
a mouth on him or what?

116
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,700
Does he take after his father? 
/ Who knows?

117
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,365
I met his father for five minutes
 and that was enough.

118
00:08:13,365 --> 00:08:16,443
Apparently. 
/ I didn't want him.

119
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:21,446
Next thing I knew he was on his way
 and now I'm stuck with him.

120
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:25,201
... I'm just furious with
 Mr. Sheffield.

121
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:28,739
The little boy's father? 
/ No, the little girl's father.

122
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:33,923
The little boy's is Mr. Bradley. 
/ You call them both Mister?

123
00:08:33,923 --> 00:08:39,796
Well, I don't really know either 
of them that well. / What!?

124
00:08:39,796 --> 00:08:46,079
Oh, you think that me and them are 
their ...? Oh, I'm the nanny.

125
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:50,148
... Hey, Frank, don't 
aim that at her ...

126
00:08:53,869 --> 00:08:55,453
Good boy.

127
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,676
You're very patient.  
Maybe I should get a nanny.

128
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:03,250
Oh, you really should, with one baby
 and another one on the way.

129
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:09,330
And two more at home. / Oh, honey, 
you don't need a nanny, you need a hobby.

130
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,115
Stop it!  You're makin' 
her bald!

131
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:16,832
Hey, Frank.  Quit it.  
There's no hair club for dolls.

132
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:18,621
Frank, did you hear me?

133
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:21,470
... Are you going to make
 me walk over there?

134
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,113
... He's gonna make
 me walk over there.

135
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:25,968
Frank, get him off me!

136
00:09:25,968 --> 00:09:29,611
Oh, Calgon, take me away.

137
00:09:30,577 --> 00:09:35,845
Giddiyap, little donkey.
 / Fran!  He's pulling my hair!

138
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:40,389
Frank!  Get off of her before
 I count to three.

139
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:44,644
One.  Two.  Two and a half.

140
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:48,101
Two and three quarters. 
/ Three!  Three!  Three!

141
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:50,775
Oh!  Frank! 
/ Ooooohhhh!!!

142
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:54,329
You hit me!
 / I did not.

143
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:57,123
Did so!  I'm going to tell
 my father on you!

144
00:09:57,123 --> 00:10:00,903
Oh, I'm really shakin'. 
 What's he gonna do?

145
00:10:00,903 --> 00:10:03,933
I hear your boss has
 a new play coming up.

146
00:10:06,763 --> 00:10:09,549
Who are you, Siskel and Ebert?

147
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:21,076
Niles, have you seen my yellow note 
pad with all my notes on it?

148
00:10:21,076 --> 00:10:24,187
Not recently, Sir.  
Where did you have it last?

149
00:10:24,187 --> 00:10:27,549
Why do people always ask that? 
 If I remembered where I had it last,

150
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:31,438
I'd go there and get it. 
 Not bother you about it, wouldn't I?

151
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:36,884
The mantle.  I was pacing and I left it
 on the ....  Niles, you're a genius.

152
00:10:36,884 --> 00:10:40,358
Honored to be "The Wind Beneath 
Your Wings," Sir.

153
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:45,024
Hi.  We're back. 
/ How was the park?

154
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:48,931
Oh, you know, birds, trees, 
muggers.  The usual.

155
00:10:49,137 --> 00:10:52,242
Tell me, sweetheart, did you and Frank 
Junior have a good time together?

156
00:10:52,242 --> 00:10:54,180
We hit it off.  We broke bread.

157
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,672
Oh ... I'm glad.

158
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:58,989
I ... I really appreciate you doing
 this because, well, you know,

159
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:05,235
Bradley's father's review could really
 make or break our play,
 and we've worked so hard on it.

160
00:11:05,235 --> 00:11:08,690
I mean, it's not just me.  I mean, 
there's all kinds of jobs at stake.

161
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,539
The cast, crew, ushers, 
Old Pops at the stage door.

162
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,355
Oh, forgot Old Pops.

163
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:16,745
Telephone, Sir. 
 It's Mr. Bradley.

164
00:11:16,745 --> 00:11:21,690
Probably calling to try and steal you away.
 / Oh, well, I might be available.

165
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:25,890
Hello, Frank ....  What?

166
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,666
... Well ....  I ...
 I'm teribly sorry.  I ....

167
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,914
Well, th ... there must be some mistake.

168
00:11:31,914 --> 00:11:36,377
No.  No.  Frank, there's absolutely no
 reason to bring any lawyers into this.

169
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,371
... Frank ... Frank! 
 Hello?  Hello!?

170
00:11:42,072 --> 00:11:44,862
You wouldn't hurt the woman 
carrying your child, would you?

171
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:48,084
All right.  I ...
 I'm trying to stay calm.

172
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:52,683
That's good, because you are entering those 
dangerous heart attack years.

173
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:57,741
Miss Fein, you struck a child? 
/ Struck a child?  Oh, God, let it be Grace.

174
00:11:57,741 --> 00:12:03,523
It was ... it was little Frank Bradley.  
Miss Fein hit him with a baguette.

175
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:08,526
She nailed him.  Ka-pow!

176
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:12,824
Don't help, honey.  
You can't nail someone with a baguette,

177
00:12:12,824 --> 00:12:15,547
unless it's stale, of course. 
 Or ... or sour dough.

178
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:18,531
Or a nicce hard crouton aimed 
at the Adam's apple.

179
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:20,741
Do you have any idea
 what you've done?

180
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:24,777
Well, it's been a very busy day. 
 Can you be more specific?

181
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:28,607
I'll tell you what we'll do. 
 We'll invite Mr. Bradley and his son over

182
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:31,471
so Miss Fein can apologize to them.

183
00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:35,476
So even though the kid deserved it,
 I'm gonna have to beg and ... and grovel and ...

184
00:12:35,476 --> 00:12:41,016
and completely debase myself? 
/ Miss Babcock will show you how it's done.

185
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:45,055
I don't think a gift basket is
 gonna get us out of this one.

186
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,268
I may have to offer myself.

187
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,392
Might as well close the play now.

188
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:04,088
Don't touch that door.

189
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:08,443
Is it just me, or does
 he need a vacation?

190
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:11,869
We're conserving the cold until
 that wretched repairman gets here.

191
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:14,444
Now tell me what you want.
  You get one request.

192
00:13:14,444 --> 00:13:16,095
Um, milk.
 / Yogurt.

193
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,778
Miss Grace? 
/ I'm not that hungry.

194
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:23,146
Suit yourself.  But I warn you. 
 The door won't open again until six o'clock.

195
00:13:23,146 --> 00:13:25,360
Okay.  Pudding.

196
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:29,067
Two seconds.

197
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:35,841
That's a new personal best.

198
00:13:36,947 --> 00:13:39,380
This isn't pudding.  
This is cocktail onions.

199
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,790
Well, I'd make you a martini, 
but the ice is melted.

200
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,473
I know these measures 
may seem a bit ... harsh,

201
00:13:45,473 --> 00:13:48,197
but in order to ensure
 that no more food spoils,

202
00:13:48,197 --> 00:13:51,570
the refrigerator doors must 
remain shut at all times.

203
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:56,463
Pew!  Niles, something smells like 
it died in here. / Oh, Miss Fein?

204
00:13:56,992 --> 00:13:59,849
All right.  I'll have a bagel.

205
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,094
Get back.  She's armed. 
/ Put the bagel down

206
00:14:03,094 --> 00:14:06,660
and step away 
from the bread box.

207
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:13,220
This is all your fault, Niles.  
You had to have that stupid baguette.

208
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,324
Baguettes don't hurt people. 
 People hurt people.

209
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:20,723
I can't believe Mr. Sheffield 
is making me do this.

210
00:14:20,723 --> 00:14:25,150
What are you complaining about?  
All you have to do is apologize.
  I have to make the refreshments.

211
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,347
Thank you, Niles.  It's so nice to
 know that we're in on this together.

212
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:30,871
Well, meanwhile, 
the caviar is sweating,

213
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,258
the Brie is running
 and my croutotae's limp.

214
00:14:34,258 --> 00:14:36,978
You know, they got
 an operation for that now.

215
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:48,273
I can't believe that you're making me 
apologize for something when
 I really didn't do anything wrong.

216
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:50,686
Look, Miss Fein, if you really 
didn't do anything wrong,

217
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:54,148
just smile and be charming and nice 
and lie through your teeth.

218
00:14:54,148 --> 00:14:59,536
Oh, well, if you put it that way, I suppose
 I can make believe that I'm at a tax audit.

219
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:02,973
Hello, hello.  Maxwell,
 this is Frank Bradley.

220
00:15:02,973 --> 00:15:07,008
Well, of course.  It is good to meet you, 
Frank. / Hello, Sheffield.

221
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:11,220
Oh, I ... I do apologize for this whole
 ugly mess.  I feel terrible.

222
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,859
Really?  I thought you'd be used to disasters 
by now.  You certainly have produced enough of them.

223
00:15:17,946 --> 00:15:20,195
Oh, there's that Bradley wit.

224
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:23,308
Oh, and you must be Frank Junior. 
 Nice to meet you, young man.

225
00:15:23,308 --> 00:15:26,569
Your hand's sweaty.  Nervous?

226
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,920
What a charming little snot ... 
ah, tot.

227
00:15:31,627 --> 00:15:35,412
Miss Fein, don't you have something you want
 to say to Mr. Bradley and his son?

228
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:38,691
Yeah, but then I'd have something
 else to apologize for.

229
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:41,895
Miss Fein! 
/ Oh, all right.  Okay.

230
00:15:41,895 --> 00:15:46,232
Mr. Bradley, things might have gotten 
a little out of hand at the park

231
00:15:46,232 --> 00:15:50,919
and whose ever fault it was, not mine, 
I suppose I would be sorry.

232
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:54,191
Well, that's that then. 
 A heartfelt apology.  Shall we?

233
00:15:54,191 --> 00:15:59,142
Well, I think it needs some work.
  What do you think, son?

234
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:03,565
It left me cold ... much like
 Robert Goulet in "Cyrano."

235
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:07,681
That's my boy. 
 How fast they grow up.

236
00:16:07,681 --> 00:16:11,194
Soon he'll be closing plays and
 destroying careers.

237
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:14,565
You must be very proud.

238
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:19,999
Well, I'd love to stand here and grovel, but ...
 I'm afraid I have to walk the dog.  Chester!

239
00:16:20,653 --> 00:16:25,024
C'mon, boy.  C'mon, boy.
  It's all right.  Yes.

240
00:16:25,024 --> 00:16:29,294
Where do you wanna go?  Oh, Pomerania. 
 Well, I'll get my coat.

241
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:35,259
That dog's ugly.  It's got beedy little
 eyes and a pointy little nose.

242
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:37,967
He looks like her.

243
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,135
They're from the same litter.

244
00:16:42,888 --> 00:16:44,929
Finger sandwich?

245
00:16:45,142 --> 00:16:48,006
Ooh, what idiot made these?

246
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:52,303
I did.  And they came 
from a real little boy.

247
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:59,148
Yes.  Finger sandwich,
 Mr. Bradley?

248
00:16:59,425 --> 00:17:03,319
A man like you deserves a good finger
 every now and then.

249
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:08,980
Sheffield, I can't believe 
that you employ this woman.

250
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,768
She's rude, she's insolent,
 and totally *******

251
00:17:12,768 --> 00:17:15,680
and keep this damn beast .

252
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,945
Ow!

253
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:19,775
Your dog bit me.
 / He's not my dog.

254
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:21,776
Yes, he is. 
/ What?

255
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:25,799
This dog has absolutely no connection whatsoever
 to either myself, Maxwell or our play.

256
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,379
That dog is a menace to society. 
 He ought to be put to sleep.

257
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:30,023
Sure.  No problem.

258
00:17:30,023 --> 00:17:34,059
Hey, listen Cruella,
 nobody is touching this dog.

259
00:17:34,806 --> 00:17:38,444
He's my dog.
 / I thought he was hers.

260
00:17:38,444 --> 00:17:41,634
I forgot.  Maxwell gave him 
to me for my birthday.

261
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:45,367
It was a gift from the heart, 
so if I want to kill him, I can.

262
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:50,175
Niles, quick.  Get a bucket of water. 
 Let's see if she melts.

263
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:54,812
Sheffield, if you want to avoid a lawsuit,
 I suggest that you muzzle that dog

264
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:57,822
and muzzle the nanny as well.

265
00:17:58,047 --> 00:18:02,446
You know, Frank, I'm getting bloody
 tired of kissing up to you.

266
00:18:02,446 --> 00:18:04,626
I'm not.  Let me do it.

267
00:18:04,962 --> 00:18:07,214
Miss Fein was right
 from the beginning.

268
00:18:07,214 --> 00:18:10,293
I should never have forced my little 
girl to play with your son.

269
00:18:10,293 --> 00:18:12,883
Quite clearly he deserved
 everything he got.

270
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,476
And I don't care what you 
think about my play.

271
00:18:15,476 --> 00:18:19,042
And frankly, I don't care
 much for you, either.

272
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:22,812
Now let me show you the door.
  It's over there.

273
00:18:23,838 --> 00:18:25,656
Son, let's go.

274
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:33,467
You'll never work
 in this town again.

275
00:18:37,655 --> 00:18:41,949
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, you know,
 it takes you a while,

276
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:47,941
but when you see the light, boy, you just
 jump on that white horse and you go.

277
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:51,821
And you, my little
 fluffy protector

278
00:18:51,821 --> 00:18:56,251
you were just like Kevin Costner 
in the Bodyguard.

279
00:18:57,035 --> 00:19:00,062
Except you have a better haircut.

280
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:11,695
Oh, I thought the play
 was just excellent.

281
00:19:11,695 --> 00:19:15,430
Put in a seafood buffet and
 you've got yourself a hit.

282
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:19,466
Miss Fein, if you enjoyed it that much,
 how come you snuck out before the curtain call?

283
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:23,959
Well, 'cause nature called. 
 And by the way, not to knock your theatre,

284
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:28,331
but two stalls, six hundred women? 
 It's like Tokyo in there.

285
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:33,337
I hate waiting for reviews. 
 My stomach has been in knots all day long.

286
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:35,852
Oh, we really don't have anything 
to be concerned about.

287
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:39,611
I mean, whatever else he might be,
 Frank Bradley is a professional.

288
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:44,384
Right.  He's not gonna let his personal 
feelings get in the way of his judgment.

289
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,147
We're doomed.

290
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,766
I thought these pictures were 
supposed to be of famous people.

291
00:19:49,766 --> 00:19:52,421
Who's Ethel Merman?

292
00:19:53,198 --> 00:19:57,314
Never heard of her.
 / How 'bout Mary Martin?

293
00:19:57,314 --> 00:19:58,862
Beats me.

294
00:19:58,862 --> 00:20:02,733
Hey, hey, hey, how 'bout this one. 
 Groucho Marx?

295
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:06,364
Oh, he must be Markie Marx grandfather.

296
00:20:07,313 --> 00:20:09,142
Oh, look here it is, 
here it is.

297
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,682
Oh, I can't look.  Just tell me
 which way his thumb is pointing.

298
00:20:11,682 --> 00:20:18,212
Well, it's time for Critics Corner. 
 Unfortunately, Frank Bradley is out 
with food poisoning tonight.

299
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:21,954
The finger sandwiches.

300
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:27,496
I ate the finger sandwiches.
 / Oops, that darn refrigerator.

301
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:33,053
So we went right to the theatre to get 
the opinion of the common man.

302
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:34,461
Hi.

303
00:20:34,906 --> 00:20:38,444
Fran, that's you. 
/ I know.  Do I look a little chunky?

304
00:20:38,765 --> 00:20:42,304
I loved it.
  It was a masterpiece.

305
00:20:42,304 --> 00:20:45,882
Compelling, riveting. 
 A sheer enchantment.

306
00:20:45,882 --> 00:20:48,254
Two thumbs up.

307
00:20:48,254 --> 00:20:53,284
Bartender, I think there's something
 wrong with your set.   I sound so nasal.

308
00:20:54,398 --> 00:20:57,709
It was a perfect evening of theatre,

309
00:20:57,709 --> 00:21:01,574
although adding a few stalls for
 the ladies room wouldn't kill 'em.

310
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:03,294
Bye.

311
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:07,308
Well, it looks like a hit to us.

312
00:21:09,203 --> 00:21:11,991
Oh, thank you, Miss Fein.

313
00:21:13,965 --> 00:21:14,939
Oh ....

314
00:21:16,862 --> 00:21:21,060
Any time, Mr. Sheffield. Any time.

315
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,681
Well, that makes it official.

316
00:21:28,681 --> 00:21:31,815
Our final perishable 
has perished.

317
00:21:32,341 --> 00:21:35,458
And there's the repairman
 in the nick of time.

318
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:38,158
Well, listen, the man is
 highly in demand.

319
00:21:38,158 --> 00:21:42,277
This is a very sensitive piece
 of equipment.  Who're you gonna call?

320
00:21:42,277 --> 00:21:44,618
Crash Busters!

321
00:21:56,506 --> 00:21:59,168
Yeah, I'll just come look
 at the ol' frigidaire.

322
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:02,521
Well, actually,
 it's a sub-zero.

323
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:06,629
Not anymore.

324
00:22:15,695 --> 00:22:20,573
Could be a condenser problem.  
I think you got a crack.

325
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:24,536
We've got a crack.
 / Mmmm ....

326
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:28,618
You know, I think these repairmen must
 all shop at the same store.

327
00:22:28,618 --> 00:22:31,364
Yeah.  The Gap.

328
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:52,530
Oh, thank you so much ... and I'd like
 you all to please meet my dear friend,

329
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:57,015
a man that I'll kiss any day
 on both cheeks Mr. Dan Ackroyd.
