1
00:00:03,261 --> 00:00:06,282
My teacher told us about 
the comet that hit Jupiter.

2
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:09,214
It exploded like 
a million atom bombs.

3
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:12,699
That couldn't happen
 to earth, could it?

4
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:16,099
Didn't you hear?

5
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:22,464
Well, next year
 around your birthday,

6
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:25,695
this giant comet
 will obliterate us.

7
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:28,787
Why do you think
 we're living like this?

8
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:32,062
Dad's spending all 
his money because...

9
00:00:32,062 --> 00:00:35,078
we're all going to die.

10
00:00:38,014 --> 00:00:40,060
Hello, sweetheart.

11
00:00:42,373 --> 00:00:45,436
Boy, your sister's in good 
voice today.  How's it going?

12
00:00:45,436 --> 00:00:47,595
Same old, same old.

13
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:50,263
Ma, get out of the taxi.

14
00:00:50,263 --> 00:00:52,959
It's a spring in the dog's neck.

15
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:56,034
What are you so fascinated about?

16
00:00:56,034 --> 00:01:00,629
Yi, Leave me alone.  I like to
 sing along in the theather.

17
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,939
Ma, it wasn't a musical.

18
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:06,401
Oh, you should have seen her
 in "Shindler's List."

19
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:10,573
She was snapping her fingers and
 singing away, "Papa, can you hear me?"

20
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:15,878
Meanwhile, the show in my head was
 better than that crap we just saw.

21
00:01:15,878 --> 00:01:20,263
So how was the theater, ladies?
 / Wonderful.

22
00:01:20,263 --> 00:01:24,613
Thank you for the tickets.
 / Meanwhile, my feet are killing me.

23
00:01:24,613 --> 00:01:28,349
Ma, those aren't your shows.

24
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:31,171
Oh, I kicked off my shoes 
in the theater.

25
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:34,693
These must be the lady's
 sitting next to me.

26
00:01:34,693 --> 00:01:37,371
And you just put them on?  
You don't even look down?

27
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:42,525
Sweetheart, I haven't seen
 my feet in 20 years.

28
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:45,924
Whose rain coat is this?

29
00:01:45,924 --> 00:01:51,980
Oh, I'll tell you, it's a miracle
 we got to Blimpy's without them
 throwing a net over us.

30
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,356
Come here, son.  Give grandma a hug.

31
00:01:57,172 --> 00:01:59,506
Harder.

32
00:01:59,506 --> 00:02:01,820
Squeeze me.

33
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,344
All right, Yetta, okay.  You should
 have seen her at Chip and Dales.

34
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:08,525
Her entire social security check
 went down a G-string.

35
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:13,240
Well, lucrative as that sounds,
 I really have to get back to work.

36
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:19,141
Oh, hi, kids. Look who I brought home 
with me, Ma and you remember Grandma Yetta?

37
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:22,145
Hi. 
/ My little pitzalaughs.

38
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:29,756
Oh, they're all their father.  
They got nothing from you.

39
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:34,325
Ma, these are not Fran's children.
 Fran doesn't have any children.

40
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:38,279
She's not married.
  She's all alone.

41
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,074
Louder, mom, I don't think 
they heard you in Uruguay.

42
00:02:44,074 --> 00:02:48,482
More importantly, why doesn't 
anyone ever eat these fruit?

43
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:51,192
Because they're wax.

44
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:54,228
Even the grapes?

45
00:02:59,171 --> 00:03:03,708
Fran, she's gonna to drive me 
to the looney bin.

46
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:07,462
I got news for you, Ma,
 you're already there.

47
00:03:07,462 --> 00:03:10,273
You guys argue a lot. 
/ Oh, no, we don't, honey.

48
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:14,128
It's just that we're all so very different.
  It's hard to believe we're from the same family.

49
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:17,280
Oh, wait a minute, Ma. 
 You got a little smutz over there.

50
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,318
Hold on.  You got some mascara.

51
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:26,786
Hold it.  Whose purse is this?

52
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:32,000
Let me see that. 
/ Boy, today's your lucky day, Ma.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,739
The purse matches the shoes.

54
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,145
Okay, kids, get ready for supper. 
 Say good-bye. /  All right.  Bye, everyone.

55
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:39,612
Bye. 
/ Good-bye, my darling.

56
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:42,840
Nice kids.  Meanwhile,
 they don't say two words.

57
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,902
Who could get two words in with you?

58
00:03:44,902 --> 00:03:48,376
Ma, don't wind me up. 
/ Don't hit Nanna.  What are you an animal?

59
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:51,814
Don't talk to your mother like that.

60
00:03:55,295 --> 00:03:58,903
Well, all good things must 
come to an end. Bye, Ma;

61
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:02,044
bye, Grandma Yetta.  
We'll go to the theater again soon.

62
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:05,082
Maybe next time
 you could pick up a hat.

63
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:07,944
Didn't you tell her? 
/ What?

64
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:13,168
Sweetheart, they're tenting 
the retirement home for termites.

65
00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:18,398
Oh, fun.  So you're going to go 
stay with Ma? / Sort of.

66
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:23,081
Sort of like ultra-suede
 is sort of washable

67
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:26,515
or sort of like you're 
sort of a Size 8?

68
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:32,213
Well, I am in the United Kingdom. 
/ Ma...

69
00:04:32,213 --> 00:04:36,413
No.  Sort of like maybe
 she could sort of stay with you.

70
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:39,764
Here?  Ma, why can't 
she stay at your place?

71
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:42,860
No.  I don't want to be 
a burden on family.

72
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,430
These people I don't know.

73
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:40,788
Maxwell, have I ever told you how much 
I love working out of the house?

74
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:43,391
I feel I belong here.

75
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:46,898
And the children are really
 warming up to me.

76
00:05:48,856 --> 00:05:50,346
Hello.

77
00:05:50,346 --> 00:05:52,849
No, there's no Maggie here.
  You have the wrong number.

78
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:57,990
Excuse me, Cee Cee. 
 My daughter, Maggie. / Oh...

79
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:03,660
Hello.  Oh, Greg, listen, 
you do know Maggie has her own line, don't you?

80
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,226
Yeah, well, that's quite all right.

81
00:06:05,226 --> 00:06:07,349
Well, I'm very glad you like her.

82
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:10,755
Yeah, and I'm thrilled
 she drives you crazy.

83
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:15,183
Yeah, keep going Greg, and you'll 
never see her again. Good-bye, Greg.

84
00:06:15,604 --> 00:06:18,089
Knock, knock. 
/ Yes, Miss Fine, what is it?

85
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:22,669
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, you just gotta 
indulge me here a minute.

86
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:27,320
You're not going to believe it.  My grandmother's
 retirement home is infested with termites,

87
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,439
and my mother came up with
 the bright idea ...

88
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:34,272
get ready for a loo loo ...

89
00:06:34,272 --> 00:06:39,261
that she should come stay
 here with us.  Ma ...

90
00:06:41,424 --> 00:06:45,345
I know ... I know.
  She's a borderline clepto.

91
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:49,906
We wouldn't have a candy dish
 left in the house.

92
00:06:50,445 --> 00:06:53,826
Oh, well, I'll go tell my mother
 that she's not staying.

93
00:06:53,826 --> 00:06:56,898
Well, at least we know 
where she gets it.

94
00:06:59,846 --> 00:07:05,698
Well, you know, Miss Fine, sometimes 
you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't.

95
00:07:06,755 --> 00:07:09,305
What's so funny, poking fun
 at a little old lady?

96
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:13,262
What's that, that British humor
 that nobody gets?

97
00:07:13,262 --> 00:07:17,064
Well, Miss Fine, you, you just 
said yourself she was a clepto.

98
00:07:17,064 --> 00:07:20,750
Yeah, well, I'm allowed. 
 She's my clepto.

99
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,084
Well, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to offend you,
 but can't she stay with your mother?

100
00:07:24,084 --> 00:07:28,975
No.  The big cats can't share a cage.

101
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:34,665
Don't back down, Maxwell.  We don't need
 some old crone running around the house.

102
00:07:34,665 --> 00:07:38,210
Yes.  We are crone heavy, sir.

103
00:07:40,454 --> 00:07:43,936
Although with two, we'd have a set.

104
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:53,635
Never mind, Mr. Sheffield.  I'll just take
 her to one of those 24-hour markets,

105
00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:56,700
let her squeeze fruit
 for a couple of days.

106
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,907
All right, look, Miss Fine.  I'll,
 I'll put her up at the St. Regis Hotel.

107
00:07:59,907 --> 00:08:03,536
How's that, huh?  She'll have room service,
 everything, fit for a queen.

108
00:08:03,536 --> 00:08:07,650
You can't insult family like that.

109
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,756
Me you can send, I got thick skin.

110
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:15,464
Besides, I think that it's good for children
 to spend time with their grandmother.

111
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:17,505
She's not their grandmother.

112
00:08:17,505 --> 00:08:22,871
Oh, all right.  You tell her.
 She stays alone like a dog in that home.

113
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:26,994
Fine.  Let her stay. 
 As a matter of fact,

114
00:08:26,994 --> 00:08:30,075
I want her to stay. 
 She can have the master bedroom.

115
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:35,780
Oh, no.  With that marble tub, she'll slip, 
break her hip, you'll have a lawsuit on your hands.

116
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,496
Miss Fine!

117
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:41,369
Oh, thank you, Mr. Sheffield,
 Thank you so much.

118
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:44,873
And I promise you won't even 
know that she's here.

119
00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:01,302
Franny, can I sit outside in
 my brassiere?  Will anyone see?

120
00:09:13,878 --> 00:09:17,443
Miss Fine, are you aware of this?

121
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:20,950
Yeah, "Body Heat," with William Hurt
 and Kathleen Turner,

122
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,647
before her little side trip 
to Pepperidge Farm.

123
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:27,492
Maggie is only 15 years old.

124
00:09:27,492 --> 00:09:30,246
She's much too young to be
 watching movies this racy.

125
00:09:30,246 --> 00:09:35,235
Oh, you call this racy?  You obviously never 
saw "The Postman Always Rings Twice."

126
00:09:35,235 --> 00:09:39,969
Oh, when he cleared
 that table, hoooha.

127
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,274
Where is she anyway?

128
00:09:43,274 --> 00:09:46,252
I mean is she ever coming back from
 this date, or has she just moved out?

129
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,699
Relax.  She's been back for an hour.

130
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:50,241
Oh, really? 
 I didn't hear her come in.

131
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:52,980
Well, I didn't say she came in.

132
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:57,713
Leave them alone.  Leave them alone.

133
00:09:57,713 --> 00:09:58,782
What are they doing?

134
00:09:58,782 --> 00:10:01,333
Nothing, nothing,
 all four hands are visible.

135
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:05,874
One, two, three ... here comes four.
  Here comes four.

136
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:09,037
How much time does he need already? 
 They just went on the date for heaven sakes.

137
00:10:09,037 --> 00:10:13,809
He's not leaving for the Crimean War.
 / Oh, Mr. Sheffield.

138
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:16,527
Hello, children. 
 Good-bye, Greg.

139
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:22,636
I can't believe you did that. 
 I have never been so embarrassed in my life.

140
00:10:22,636 --> 00:10:27,078
Oh, really?  Not even when
 you were watching "Body Heat"?

141
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:34,573
You went in my room? 
 Have you ever heard of privacy?

142
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:36,894
How would you like it if
 I went through your stuff?

143
00:10:36,894 --> 00:10:40,491
Oh, don't bother.
  He locks everything.

144
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:46,735
I don't ever want you
 seeing that boy again.

145
00:10:46,735 --> 00:10:50,150
You can't stop me. / Oh, oh, oh. 
 Watch this.  You're grounded.

146
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,166
I hate you. / Well, that's tough.

147
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,342
You forgot to stick your tongue out.
 / Well, you might have backed me up a little.

148
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:59,973
Me?  The Pips can't back you up.

149
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:04,548
What's all the commotion? 
/ He went through my things.

150
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:08,666
Oh, honey, I know just how you feel.

151
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:15,367
At the home, they ransack your room two, 
three times a month looking for cake.

152
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:22,028
Come, we'll talk.  Don't fight 
in front of the kids. / Ow!

153
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:22,990
Ow!

154
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:29,018
See how sensitive Yetta is. 
 She'll be a great influence on Maggie.

155
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:32,004
You want a cigarette?

156
00:11:37,557 --> 00:11:40,762
Good morning, Niles.
 / Uh-huh.

157
00:11:40,762 --> 00:11:42,467
What's the matter with you?

158
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:46,016
Oh, it's very disturbing to see
 Mr. Sheffield and Miss Margaret fight.

159
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:50,827
Oh, that was a fight?  I hate you,
 who cares, and, now.

160
00:11:50,827 --> 00:11:56,768
In my house the fight ain't over until
 the fat lady grabs the ginzo and says, 
"Here, cut my heart out."

161
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,826
We never say a cross word 
in our family.

162
00:11:59,826 --> 00:12:04,271
We just die very early
 of colon disorders.

163
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:06,371
Good morning, everyone.
 / Good morning.

164
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:08,350
Niles, tea.

165
00:12:12,752 --> 00:12:15,311
What on earth is that?

166
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:19,430
Grandma Yetta says this tea bag still
 has seven cups left in it.

167
00:12:20,052 --> 00:12:22,662
My Bubba Yetta doesn't
 like to waste anything.

168
00:12:22,662 --> 00:12:26,062
If food is moldy, it's a vaccine. 
 Ha, ha.

169
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:33,385
Oh, come on, lighten up.  You going to be
 this way when Maggie comes down?

170
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,601
If I ever talked to my father
 the way she talked to me,

171
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:39,708
I'd have been throttled within an inch of 
my life and thrown in the root cellar.

172
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:44,190
Why do you always have to take 
me to Oliver Twist land?

173
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,481
Do you know how many times 
I told my father I hated him?

174
00:12:47,481 --> 00:12:49,969
Yeah.  And how did he react? 
/ Oh, who the hell knows.

175
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:54,996
He couldn't hear a damn thing over
 that Bonanza theme blasting in the background.

176
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,884
Good morning, Margaret.

177
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:04,116
Daddy, I'm sorry
 I said I hated you.

178
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,716
Bubba Yetta said you only have 
one father, and she's right.

179
00:13:08,348 --> 00:13:10,592
Well, I'm sorry too.

180
00:13:10,812 --> 00:13:13,611
And you were going to tell her
 that she's not grounded anymore.

181
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:16,383
You almost forgot that part.

182
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:20,259
Ah, yes, I was going to say that.
  What she said.

183
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,501
Well, Miss Fine, it seems
 I underestimated your booby.

184
00:13:26,394 --> 00:13:31,539
That's bubby.  No one's ever
 underestimated my booby.

185
00:13:34,035 --> 00:13:36,696
You know, Dad,
 it's a real pretty day.

186
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:39,545
Greg asked if I could go 
on a picnic.  May I?

187
00:13:39,545 --> 00:13:41,760
Well, Margaret, I don't think ...

188
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,800
that sounds like a good idea.

189
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,531
So long as you're back by 6:00 ... 
7:00 ... 8:00 ...

190
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:52,092
Thanks, guys.

191
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:56,497
Have a wonderful time and don't do
 anything that I forgot I did.

192
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,664
Oh, don't worry.  I had a long
 conversation with Yetta. / Good.

193
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:02,820
You know, Yetta turned out 
to be pretty cool.

194
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,491
You know, she gave me a hundred
 bucks for my bar mitzvah.

195
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,480
Of course she also thinks
 my name is Smuey.

196
00:14:14,357 --> 00:14:17,760
Something smells. 
/ Just eat it.

197
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,213
No.  Like something's burning.

198
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:25,562
Seems to be coming from upstairs. 
/ Oh, my God.  Yetta.

199
00:14:25,756 --> 00:14:31,308
I can't believe she would be smoking in bed,
 not after that Circle 7 motel went up in ...

200
00:14:31,308 --> 00:14:36,223
never mind. 
/ Yetta, Yetta, stand back.

201
00:14:36,674 --> 00:14:36,954
Oh ...

202
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:51,088
Ah.  Well, I was right.
  She was smoking.

203
00:14:55,885 --> 00:14:58,679
Oh, my God.  Yetta ...

204
00:14:58,886 --> 00:15:04,521
What a coincidence. Saul said 
the same thing not ten minutes ago.

205
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:11,080
What the devil's burning? 
/ Oh, God.

206
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,552
Oh, Saul, I ruined your bagel.

207
00:15:13,552 --> 00:15:15,760
Oh, no, no.

208
00:15:16,134 --> 00:15:19,530
You can just scrape off the top.
 It's still good.

209
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:24,120
Miss Fine. / What did you
 do with all the cream cheese?

210
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:31,827
Thank you, Miss Fine.

211
00:15:31,827 --> 00:15:35,699
Thank you for bringing
 this influence into my home.

212
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:40,880
Well, you know, Mr. Sheffield, it's really 
kind of sweet if you think about it.....

213
00:15:41,082 --> 00:15:44,099
Are you out of your mind?

214
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:49,525
This is the Sheffield home. 
 No one ever has sex in this house.

215
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,874
This, this is the woman you let give 
my daughter advice about sex?

216
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:01,719
Well, at least you know 
the advice was current.

217
00:16:02,614 --> 00:16:05,529
Margaret ...
 / Oh, Miss Margaret just left, sir.

218
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:09,060
Oh, good morning, Ms. Rosenberg,
 Mr. Kanazel.

219
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,264
What?  You knew about this?
 / Yes.  My room is directly beneath theirs...

220
00:16:15,268 --> 00:16:17,108
Bravo...

221
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:28,076
I, I just can't believe 
I gave Maggie permission to go.

222
00:16:28,076 --> 00:16:31,918
She's just a little girl. 
/ Well, now, don't get all upset.

223
00:16:31,918 --> 00:16:34,689
We don't know what Yetta told her.

224
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:36,916
Told who?
 / Maggie.

225
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:40,682
I told her we could all die
 tomorrow.  Go for it.

226
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:46,995
Go for it? 
/ All right.  Now you could be upset.

227
00:16:47,277 --> 00:16:49,803
I hold you completely 
responsible for this.

228
00:16:49,803 --> 00:16:52,695
Why?  What did I do?
 / She's your grandmother.

229
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:56,242
Oh, we don't know that for sure.  
Some woman comes walking out of Europe

230
00:16:56,242 --> 00:17:01,468
with a dining room table strapped to her back. 
 She could be anybody's relative.

231
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:04,600
What?

232
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:11,577
Good night, Niles.
 / It is now.

233
00:17:12,883 --> 00:17:17,603
Oh, Niles, dear sweet pompous Niles.

234
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,985
Maxwell and Nanny Fine are on the outs,
 and there is nothing

235
00:17:20,985 --> 00:17:25,826
you can say to ruin
 this glorious feeling I have.

236
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,288
You want a bet?

237
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:37,922
Grandma Yetta, aged 80,

238
00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:43,761
living in a home, got a heap of
 good loving last night.

239
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,446
And you?

240
00:17:56,582 --> 00:17:59,050
I hate my life.

241
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:02,294
Thank you.

242
00:18:06,142 --> 00:18:09,633
Niles.
 / Oh, the coast is clear, Miss Fine.

243
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:13,935
Oh, boy, here she is now.  
Devil with the blue hair on.

244
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:16,815
What?  What?  What?  What?  What? 
/ Franny,

245
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:21,675
you left your wallet right 
on top of your dresser. / So?

246
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:26,128
Thank you.

247
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:29,054
Franny, I know
 it's none of my business.

248
00:18:29,054 --> 00:18:36,546
But it might help your marriage if you 
got rid of that blond your husband's
 always hanging around with.

249
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:41,092
I don't know if you noticed, 
but your kids are blond.

250
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:45,844
They're not my kids.  
He's not my husband.

251
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:48,490
Oy, she couldn't have spaced out 
like this with Mr. Sheffield.

252
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:52,041
No, with him, she could recall
 things from the womb.

253
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:55,417
All I'm saying is that
 a blond like that

254
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:59,733
with big shoulder pads dragged
 off your grandfather.

255
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:02,991
That was a Cossack.

256
00:19:05,198 --> 00:19:10,250
Hi, Grandma Yetta. 
/ Oh, come here, angel puss.

257
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,612
So, how was your day?

258
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,314
Great.  I'm not worried 
about the end of the world.

259
00:19:17,314 --> 00:19:20,417
I'm going to live life to the fullest.
 / That a girl.

260
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:23,811
What did I tell you? 
/ Go for it.

261
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:28,712
Go for it?  I thought you
 told that to Maggie?

262
00:19:28,712 --> 00:19:32,418
That's not Maggie? 
/ No.  That's grace.

263
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:35,321
Now I'm confused.

264
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:39,994
Grace is the little one; 
Smuey is the boy;

265
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:43,677
and the tall one is Maggie.

266
00:19:43,677 --> 00:19:47,114
Hot pants?  Tell her to go for it?

267
00:19:47,114 --> 00:19:52,424
What am I, senile?  Your husband 
would throw me out of the house.

268
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,754
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, here you are.

269
00:19:57,754 --> 00:20:00,185
What are you doing out here?
  Waiting for Maggie?

270
00:20:00,185 --> 00:20:03,690
No.  I just have a game of stoop
 ball in five minutes.

271
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:07,086
Where is she?
 / Well, I've got good news for you.

272
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:11,711
Remember when we thought that Grandma Yetta 
told her to go for it with Greg? / Yeah.

273
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:15,000
Well, we were wrong.
 / Oh, thank God.

274
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,769
She told Gracie.
 / Oh, much better.  She's only seven.

275
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:22,539
And here I thought
 the woman was a kook.

276
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:26,785
Anyhow, Margaret still isn't home.

277
00:20:26,785 --> 00:20:30,576
Well, you know, it was a picnic.
  These things have to go at their own flow.

278
00:20:30,576 --> 00:20:33,903
You have to eat.  Then my mother always
 says you have to wait at least an hour

279
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:38,116
before you do strenuous physical
 activity ... like Frisbee.

280
00:20:38,626 --> 00:20:41,768
Please, Miss Fine,
 I'm just not in the mood.

281
00:20:41,768 --> 00:20:45,611
Gee, no man's ever said
 that to me before.

282
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:51,186
Although I'm sure Lisa Marie is 
getting an ear full of it.

283
00:20:56,592 --> 00:21:00,826
Come on, Mr. Sheffield, has Maggie ever
 given you a reason not to trust her?

284
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,890
Yes.  And they all coincided
 with your arrival.

285
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:08,683
Suddenly she wants to go kissing boys and 
going off to parties and concerts and things.

286
00:21:08,683 --> 00:21:11,690
Who does she think she is? 
 A teenage girl?

287
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:16,522
Um, oh, Miss Fine, I'm her father.
 I just want to protect her.

288
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:19,473
I know.  But sometimes you're just 
going to have to sit on your hands

289
00:21:19,473 --> 00:21:24,898
and let them grow up.
 / What if she grows up wrong?

290
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:28,902
Well, you've still got Smuey
 and the little one.

291
00:21:30,504 --> 00:21:33,568
Come on, Mr. Sheffield.  
Don't be her enemy.

292
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,863
Oh, no, of course not. 
 That's the last thing I want to do.

293
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:39,313
Thanks, Greg. 
/ She's home.

294
00:21:39,313 --> 00:21:43,240
How long does it take a picnic, huh ...
 / Oh, now, now, now.  You see,

295
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,499
you're getting 
all wound up again.

296
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:48,878
Just calm down.  Don't let her
 think that you were worried.

297
00:21:48,878 --> 00:21:51,859
In fact, why don't you just go upstairs. 
 Go ahead. / But I ...

298
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:54,899
I'll be up in a minute.
  Trust is a good thing.

299
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:57,216
Trust is character building.

300
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:59,883
Go ahead. I'll take care of everything.

301
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:01,819
Everything's fine.......

302
00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:05,851
Where the hell have you been?
  Do you know what time it is?

303
00:22:05,851 --> 00:22:09,002
Your father was so worried,
 I had to send him to bed.

304
00:22:09,002 --> 00:22:12,104
Fran, we didn't do anything. 
 Greg and I decided to cool it.

305
00:22:12,104 --> 00:22:15,111
Why?  I mean, good.

306
00:22:15,778 --> 00:22:17,488
I'm just not ready yet.

307
00:22:17,488 --> 00:22:21,157
Besides, do you think I'd get into any serious
 stuff without talking to you first?

308
00:22:21,157 --> 00:22:23,229
Oh, well, I thought
 you talked to Yetta.

309
00:22:23,229 --> 00:22:26,759
Yetta?  Please, I zoned out
 somewhere around buying a cow

310
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:31,274
and you can get the milk for free.
 / Oh, yep, yep, yep.  That sounds like her.

311
00:22:31,274 --> 00:22:35,745
Well, it should take you a good long
 while to get that image out of your head.

312
00:22:36,118 --> 00:22:41,452
And in the meantime, let me tell you something  
that's a little more hip and a little more happening.

313
00:22:41,452 --> 00:22:44,898
Don't do a thing
 if you ain't got that ring.

314
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:47,156
Doowap, doowap, doowap.

315
00:22:58,741 --> 00:23:03,974
Oh, I just love that Mike Meyers 
doing that coffee-talk thing.

316
00:23:07,318 --> 00:23:10,767
That clip lady is so funny.

317
00:23:11,606 --> 00:23:15,326
Oh, please.  Who talks like that?

318
00:23:18,986 --> 00:23:22,250
And that big hair ...

319
00:23:22,987 --> 00:23:26,655
I think it's very stereo typical.



9999
