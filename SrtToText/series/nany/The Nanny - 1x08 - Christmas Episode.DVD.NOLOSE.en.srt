1
00:00:03,494 --> 00:00:07,230
Okay, kids, everyone go upstairs 
and hang up your skates,

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,952
and don't forget to put
 your wet clothes in the hamper.

3
00:00:09,952 --> 00:00:11,849
No wet clothes for you,
 Miss Fine?

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,933
I didn't fall. 
/ She didn't skate.

5
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:17,536
And yet such 
a lovely ensemble.

6
00:00:17,536 --> 00:00:20,414
Oh, you should see what 
I wear when I don't play tennis.

7
00:00:21,658 --> 00:00:24,952
Oh, cranberries on a string. 
 How beautiful.

8
00:00:24,952 --> 00:00:29,385
I wonder who thought of
 this tradition? / Probably Ocean Spray.

9
00:00:29,385 --> 00:00:33,562
Niles, you old scrooge. 
 Get into the Christmas spirit.

10
00:00:33,562 --> 00:00:36,405
Spoken by one who doesn't
 have to clean it all up.

11
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:40,856
Oh, that's the thing about Hanukkah. 
 Eight candles and a menorah. 
 No fuss, no muss.

12
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:43,112
Is it too late to convert?
 / Never.

13
00:00:43,112 --> 00:00:45,732
We'll get you a bar mitzvah, 
and of course a circumcision.

14
00:00:45,732 --> 00:00:48,773
Suddenly I'm filled with 
the Christmas spirit.

15
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:40,500
My first real Christmas tree. 
 I'm so excited.

16
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,416
Miss Fine, what on earth are you doing?
 / I'm putting on the tinsel.

17
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:48,825
Not before the lights! 
/ Is that a faux pas?

18
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:52,091
Lights first, ornaments second,
 and tinsel is always last.

19
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:55,862
Father is very anal 
about his tree trimming.

20
00:01:57,101 --> 00:02:00,741
Well, one year we begged
 my mother for a Christmas tree.

21
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:02,582
She called it a Hanukkah bush.

22
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:06,086
P.S., the candles from the 
menorah set the flocking on fire

23
00:02:06,086 --> 00:02:09,516
and the fumes put my father
 into the emergency room.

24
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,807
A variation on the burning
 bush classic.

25
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:15,825
My mother took the whole thing
 as a sign from God, 
and from there on in,

26
00:02:15,825 --> 00:02:20,373
we spend every Christmas at
 the Fountainbleu in Miami Beach.

27
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:25,028
To this day I can't get a whiff of
 Ban d' Solei without having 
a yen for eggnog.

28
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,159
Sir.

29
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,148
Oh, Niles, splendid.
  Thank you very much.

30
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:31,151
All right, everyone,
 stand by.

31
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,381
Three, two, one.

32
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:35,654
Oh... 
/ Beautiful.

33
00:02:35,654 --> 00:02:39,197
Niles, I, I thought we agreed 
twinkle lights? / Here.

34
00:02:46,055 --> 00:02:49,450
Oh... Miss Fine, I, I know 
it's a holiday, and this is
 a bit of an imposition,

35
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,197
but um, would it be at all possible 
for you to work on Christmas Day?

36
00:02:53,197 --> 00:02:57,248
Oh, are you kidding?  To be part of
 a real Christmas, it's a dream come true.

37
00:02:57,248 --> 00:03:00,845
You see, I'm gonna be in D.C. 
 I'm producing a benefit
 for the Kennedy Center.

38
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:04,424
You won't be home for Christmas? 
/ He's never home for Christmas.

39
00:03:04,424 --> 00:03:07,062
Oh now, Grace,
 we've been through all this.

40
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:10,278
I'm gonna be raising money for
 children less fortunate than we are.

41
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:14,172
Yeah, but keep laying the guilt. 
We'll get better presents.

42
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:18,591
Brighton, I'm not canceling it altogether.
 We'll simply celebrate it a day early.

43
00:03:18,591 --> 00:03:22,122
He's moving Christmas? 
 You can do that?

44
00:03:22,122 --> 00:03:25,304
They do it for Washington's birthday. 
/ Well, I never got that either.

45
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:27,973
I mean, you go to all 
that trouble fathering a nation

46
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:33,976
and before you know it, you're sharing
 the third Monday in February
 with Lincoln and a white sale.

47
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:37,357
Hey, I know; why don't
 we make out our list for Santa

48
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:39,959
and then we can bring it to him when
 we go get our picture taken.

49
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,927
We already did that. 
/ Yeah, but I came out a little bloated.

50
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,187
Isn't that cute?  
She still believes in Santa.

51
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:51,122
Honey, I believe 
in anyone that delivers.

52
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,702
Yeah, well, we believe in Edna.

53
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:57,903
Edna Clause?  
Would that be the Mrs.?

54
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:01,230
No, Fran, she's Daddy's personal shopper. 
 She buys all our gifts.

55
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,318
Oh, so what you're saying is you
 give Edna your list and she gives it to Santa.

56
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,645
Please, Fran,
 I wasn't born yesterday.

57
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:14,480
If you did believe in Santa,
 what would you want him to bring you?

58
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:17,232
Daddy for Christmas.

59
00:04:17,232 --> 00:04:21,262
Oh... Well, how
 'bout a nice Easy Bake oven?

60
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,149
No?  All right,
 I'll see what I could do.

61
00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:30,419
Oh, Niles, those poor kids,

62
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,738
and that Gracie
 is the anti-Claus.

63
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,392
I gotta go talk
 to Mister Sheffield.

64
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:40,095
Well, I hope you're not going 
to upset him. He's writing out
 the staff Christmas bonuses.

65
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:43,830
Oh, how do you know? 
/ Well, did you think the keyholes polish themselves?

66
00:04:44,638 --> 00:04:46,667
So the nanny gets a bonus, too?

67
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,390
Oh, that's good news, 
because you know,

68
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,034
I really wanted to buy each of
 the kids something fabulous.

69
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:54,447
But have you seen the cost 
of fabulous nowadays?

70
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:57,204
Please.  I can't even afford wonderful.

71
00:04:57,204 --> 00:04:59,779
Fortunately, Mister Sheffield
 is very generous.

72
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:03,312
Well, if he thinks that writing 
a check is gonna make up for 
his not being here...

73
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:08,125
Four figures, Miss Fine. 
/ Oh, well, glory to the newborn king.

74
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:16,836
Maxwell, look what
 I'm standing under.

75
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:19,080
Isn't that mistletoe?

76
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,486
I'm not sure. 
 It looks rather like holly.

77
00:05:21,486 --> 00:05:23,431
It's mistletoe.

78
00:05:25,051 --> 00:05:28,260
And I do believe 
tradition calls for a kiss.

79
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,788
All right.

80
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,219
Merry Christmas, Nanny Fine.

81
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:37,132
Oops, I got some lipstick on your cheek. 
/ Oh, for heaven's sake...

82
00:05:37,132 --> 00:05:40,029
Meanwhile that shade 
looks gorgeous on you.

83
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:44,444
Oh, Mister Sheffield, do you really
 have to go out of town for the holidays?

84
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:48,569
Yes, he does. / I love the way 
you throw your voice like that.

85
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,130
I'm afraid I have to, Miss Fine.

86
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,917
It's a very important benefit.

87
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:56,414
We're raising money for the...

88
00:05:56,414 --> 00:05:59,287
Who are we raising money for? 
 The poor, right?

89
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:02,975
Miss Fine, I'd love to be with
 the family Christmas Day, 
but I'm afraid I just can't.

90
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:04,199
We can't.

91
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,254
You're going, too?
 / Uh-huh.

92
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:09,597
Well, we'll be working the entire time.
 / Well, I think we'll have time for dinner.

93
00:06:09,597 --> 00:06:11,545
No.  No dinner.

94
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:14,514
The only reason I'm going away
 with Miss Babcock is for charity.

95
00:06:14,514 --> 00:06:16,103
Thank you, Maxwell.

96
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:19,670
Well, you know what I mean. 
/ No.  No, I don't.

97
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,913
What do you need, 
to be hit over the head?

98
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:26,080
Uh, yes, Miss Fine, 
was there anything else?

99
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,665
Well, far be it for me to tell you 
how to do Christmas, but you're 
doing it all wrong.

100
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:34,082
The father's going out of town, 
the kids don't believe in Santa.

101
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:37,634
And I haven't seen one stinking
 partridge on a pear tree.

102
00:06:37,634 --> 00:06:39,862
Yeah, well, well that's 
why we're moving it up a day.

103
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:44,182
And I want it to be very special this year,
 so I told my personal shopper 
to pull out all the stops.

104
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:47,621
And that's another thing.  
This woman doesn't know our kids.

105
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:53,501
A personal shopper is so impersonal, 
although not a bad career choice.

106
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:56,815
Well, I have an interesting idea.

107
00:06:56,815 --> 00:07:00,236
During those many hours when
 the children are away at school... / Yeah?

108
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:04,024
...and you basically have nothing 
to do. / I fill my days.

109
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:07,550
Why don't you get their gifts?

110
00:07:08,196 --> 00:07:11,205
That's not the worst idea.  
I mean, you would know what they want.

111
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:13,939
Don't you wanna pick out
 your own presents?

112
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:19,283
Oh, Mister Sheffield, if it were me
 I would much rather get a gift 
that you personally picked out.

113
00:07:19,283 --> 00:07:22,244
A gift from the heart means
 so much more.

114
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:26,110
Well, I suppose I could find time
 to pop into F.A.O. Schwarz.

115
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,363
Trust me.  Whatever you pick out

116
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:31,481
they will love and cherish forever.

117
00:07:31,481 --> 00:07:33,939
Just make sure it's returnable.

118
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:44,739
Oh, I got the kids great stocking stuffers. 
/ Are you putting up a stocking?

119
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:49,045
No, I figured I'd put up my pantyhose.  
That way I'll get double. / Fran...

120
00:07:50,694 --> 00:07:52,284
Hello, ladies.
 / Hi.

121
00:07:52,284 --> 00:07:55,263
Looks like somebody else went
 shopping besides us.

122
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:58,103
Oh, yes. We had a wonderful time.

123
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:03,610
Children laughing, people passing,
 meeting smile after smile.

124
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,540
He's been doing that all day.

125
00:08:07,148 --> 00:08:10,385
So, what do you think of 
Brighton's bicycle?

126
00:08:10,385 --> 00:08:12,751
Who designed it?  Picasso?

127
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:14,759
Yeah, well, well 
it's not finished yet.

128
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,293
The salesman said that serious cyclers
 like to build the equipment themselves.

129
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:20,834
Hmm... They saw him coming.

130
00:08:21,731 --> 00:08:25,689
Well, if you need a few pointers, 
Val here is very mechanical.

131
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:28,222
I'm a plumber's daughter.

132
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:31,878
Well, thank you, Val, but,
 uh, I'm a grown man.

133
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,727
I, I think I should be able 
to assemble a child's bicycle.

134
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:38,621
Oh, hey, may 
the testosterone be with you.

135
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:44,400
Look at this great sweater that 
I got. Isn't it perfect for Maggie?

136
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,163
I got great stuff for everyone.
  I hope Brighton likes Aramis.

137
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:50,025
What did you do?  Win the lottery?

138
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:52,563
I wish.  More like rubber checks.

139
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:55,391
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
 let them bounce.

140
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:59,117
Tomorrow I'll get my Christmas bonus. 
 Saturday and Sunday the banks are closed.

141
00:08:59,117 --> 00:09:03,599
Monday I'll make an instant deposit,
 and I've done my share to stimulate the economy.

142
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,592
Don't you have a credit card?

143
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:09,616
Not since my little run in with
 Edward Scissorhands at Macy's.

144
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:16,578
Come on, everyone.  It's Merry...

145
00:09:17,092 --> 00:09:19,760
Merry morning of the day
 before Christmas.

146
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,023
Oh, Grace, look.  Santa took
 a bite out of the cookies we left him.

147
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:26,314
I didn't know Santa
 wore red lipstick.

148
00:09:26,314 --> 00:09:29,999
The man gets out of the house 
once a year, live and let live.

149
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:34,874
Fran, would you open my present first?

150
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,844
Before the family? 
 All right.

151
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,120
I hope you like it.  
I made it myself.

152
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,926
I mean, it's okay if you don't.
 / Honey, I'll love it.

153
00:09:43,926 --> 00:09:48,854
Because a gift from the heart is worth 
more than the present itself.  
Right, Mister Sheffield?

154
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,934
Absolutely, Miss Fine.

155
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:57,280
Ohhh...

156
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,333
It's a pajama holder. / Ohhh...

157
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,736
And I don't already have one.

158
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,374
Because you don't wear any pajamas.

159
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:09,562
You have polished 
your last keyhole, mister.

160
00:10:10,717 --> 00:10:12,876
Thanks, Mags.  I love it.

161
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:16,028
Dad, I love my... What is this?

162
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:18,086
It's a bicycle...kit.

163
00:10:18,086 --> 00:10:20,624
Bicycle kit?

164
00:10:20,624 --> 00:10:24,019
Oh well, half the fun of owning 
a bicycle is building it yourself.

165
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:27,272
And this is from me.

166
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:29,791
Oh, gee, guys, you shouldn't have.

167
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:34,622
He really wanted Cindy Crawford.
 / At least she's built.

168
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:38,969
Oh, Daddy, The Screamer. 
 Thank you.

169
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:41,620
Well, I'm glad you like it, 
sweetheart.  And I,

170
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,604
I hope you understand why
 I can't be here tomorrow.

171
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:48,419
I understand. 
/ There's my big girl.

172
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:52,021
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
 / Merry Christmas, Daddy.

173
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,406
No hidden hostility there.

174
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,466
So, Niles, what can I say?

175
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:02,974
Year in, year out, 
you're a friend indeed.

176
00:11:02,974 --> 00:11:05,313
Thank you and Merry Christmas.

177
00:11:05,313 --> 00:11:07,408
Oh, thank you, sir.

178
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,447
Oh, Mister Sheffield, 
more than generous.

179
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:17,129
It's hard to express
 just how much I deserve this.

180
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:18,971
Well, you're welcome.

181
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:21,514
And, Miss Fine.
 / Yeah?

182
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:25,716
Miss Fine, your contribution to our 
family has not gone unnoticed.

183
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:28,301
Oh, I think I'm gonna cry.

184
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:32,322
Thank you and Merry Christmas.

185
00:11:32,322 --> 00:11:34,285
What's this?

186
00:11:34,685 --> 00:11:36,484
Your Christmas present.

187
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:40,137
I gave it a lot of thought.
  I picked it out myself.

188
00:11:40,137 --> 00:11:42,633
Ohhh...

189
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,455
Ohhh...

190
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,759
Me and my big mouth.

191
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:58,804
Niles, will you come visit 
me in debtors prison?

192
00:11:58,804 --> 00:12:01,980
Miss fine, you should be flattered
 that Mister Sheffield got you a gift.

193
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,795
I've never known him to give 
a staff member anything but a check.

194
00:12:04,795 --> 00:12:07,420
Well who the hell needed
 that distinction?

195
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,689
You know, it really 
is a lovely vase.

196
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:14,284
Gorgeous.  But will it fit
 through an automated teller?

197
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:21,115
Niles, if you ever catch me shopping again,
 I want you to just slap me upside the head.

198
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:26,412
Oh, Maggie, you're wearing 
the new sweater I got you?  Already?

199
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,201
Oh, I just love it.  It's the most
 beautiful sweater I've ever seen.

200
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:31,401
Oh, isn't that sweet?

201
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:33,481
You didn't cut
 the tag off, did you?

202
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:34,973
Yes.  Why?

203
00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:37,929
Oh.  That's okay, that's okay.

204
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:39,561
I got the receipt.

205
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:41,617
Fran, I'm keeping this sweater. 
 I love it. / No, you don't.

206
00:12:41,617 --> 00:12:43,351
Yes, I do, because
 you gave it to me.

207
00:12:43,351 --> 00:12:45,651
Remember what you said? 
 A gift from the heart.

208
00:12:45,651 --> 00:12:49,558
Oh, all right.  
Wear it in good health.

209
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:51,109
Go.

210
00:12:55,378 --> 00:12:56,818
Now what am I gonna do?

211
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,360
Well, that offer to lend
 you the money still stands.

212
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,073
Oh, Niles, I consider
 you my friend,

213
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,959
so I'll be frank. 
I'm not good for it.

214
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,996
Well, it is a perfect piece to start
 one's personal art collection.

215
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:13,290
Thanks.  It should go great next 
to my limbo trophy from Club Med.

216
00:13:16,124 --> 00:13:18,200
What you got? 
 Something I can unload?

217
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,646
A VCR?  A nice
 semi-automatic weapon?

218
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:25,208
Paulie, don't you know a valuable 
antique when you see it?

219
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:28,635
This here is practically
 Elizabethan.

220
00:13:28,635 --> 00:13:32,413
Elizabeth Taylor? 
/ No.  Liz the queen.

221
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:34,977
Uh, no can do.
  If you said Elizabeth Montgomery,

222
00:13:34,977 --> 00:13:37,259
you know "Bewitched",
 then I can do it.

223
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:40,174
Oh, Paulie, will you please
 buy the vase?  The woman owes the world.

224
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:42,860
She's desperate. 
 We'll take anything.

225
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,665
And that, Val, is why you cannot
 find a partner for Bridge.

226
00:13:54,862 --> 00:13:56,460
Cheer up, honey.

227
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,469
Look, my favorite, 
"It's A Wonderful Life".

228
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:03,707
I've already seen it six times. 
/ Today.

229
00:14:04,362 --> 00:14:07,397
Well, there's a Christmas special 
on the shopping channel.

230
00:14:07,397 --> 00:14:11,969
Call now and you can own 
"It's A Wonderful Life" 
at a wonderful price.

231
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:14,729
Yuk.  Can you believe that?

232
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:18,456
Although, for nine 
ninety-five it is a classic.

233
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:26,124
Niles, did you remember 
my attache? / Yes, sir.

234
00:14:26,124 --> 00:14:27,628
And my carry on?
 / Always, sir.

235
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:29,667
Well, it seems we have everything.
 / Maxwell?

236
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:32,953
Oops, I guess I did 
forget one old bag.

237
00:14:34,523 --> 00:14:37,722
Daddy, I wish you could 
come to church with us.

238
00:14:37,722 --> 00:14:41,265
Do you really have to go? 
/ Oh, sweetheart, I'm afraid I have to.

239
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:44,405
I'm gonna miss you so much. 
 I'll miss all of you.

240
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:46,791
Bye, Dad. 
/ Merry Christmas, Daddy.

241
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,834
Can't we come with you? 
/ No.

242
00:14:50,468 --> 00:14:52,843
I mean, oh, wouldn't 
that be fun?

243
00:14:52,843 --> 00:14:55,445
But we're gonna be working
 round the clock.

244
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:57,592
I'm afraid she's right, Gracie.

245
00:14:57,592 --> 00:15:00,451
I mean, even if you came 
with me, I'd hardly see you.

246
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:02,634
You'll have 
a lot more fun here.

247
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:05,128
At least he only has 
to work Christmas.

248
00:15:05,128 --> 00:15:09,059
My sister is a caterer, 
she has to work every single holiday.

249
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:13,053
Thank God we fast on Yon 
Kipper or we'd never see her.

250
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,538
Thank you for that, 
Miss Fine.

251
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:19,203
And I hope you enjoy the vase. 
/ Huh?

252
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:22,377
Yes, it, it reminded
 me of you.

253
00:15:22,377 --> 00:15:25,815
One of a kind with
 just the right accent.

254
00:15:25,815 --> 00:15:29,276
You've been a, a wonderful 
addition to our family

255
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:33,485
and I hope you cherish the vase 
as the children cherish you. / Oh.

256
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:35,239
Merry Christmas,
 Miss Fine.

257
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:37,289
Merry Christmas.

258
00:15:39,796 --> 00:15:43,525
Oh, Niles, would you watch 
the kids for while?

259
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,457
I gotta go by a vase.

260
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:57,213
You know, every time a bell rings,
 an angel gets its wings.

261
00:15:57,213 --> 00:15:58,895
Who cares?

262
00:15:59,638 --> 00:16:00,925
Yeah?

263
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:03,475
Oh, Paulie, I want my vase back.

264
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:06,010
Fran, you can't do this. 
 How you gonna pay your bills?

265
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,764
Oh, I'll think of something.

266
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:12,513
That little vase is the most meaningful gift
 I've ever received in my whole life.

267
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:17,250
Oh well, except of course for
 the Polaroid Swinger you gave me for graduation.

268
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,850
Well, I was gonna say.

269
00:16:20,576 --> 00:16:22,451
Where's my money?

270
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:27,190
Uh, Paulie, would you take my watch 
for the same two hundred?

271
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:31,220
Fran, that's your grandmother's watch. 
 She gave that to you on her deathbed.

272
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,455
Thank you, Val, you're making
 this a lot easier.

273
00:16:39,643 --> 00:16:41,912
Well, that's terrible, Niles.

274
00:16:41,912 --> 00:16:44,088
Yeah, well, thank you
 for telling me.

275
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:47,508
Yes, Merry Christmas to you,
 too, old man.

276
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:48,866
What?

277
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:52,230
Well, I gave Miss Fine
 a vase in lieu of a check

278
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,257
and apparently she's just had to
 pawn her grandmother's watch

279
00:16:55,257 --> 00:16:57,784
to pay for the presents she had
 already bought for the children.

280
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:59,696
Oh, that's tragic.

281
00:16:59,696 --> 00:17:02,053
It's positively dickensian.

282
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:03,928
Oh well.

283
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,013
Wish there was something 
I could do.

284
00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:09,515
But there's no time.  Our flight
 leaves in ten minutes.

285
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:16,934
Flight eight fifty-one going to Washington
 Dulles International Airport
 will be delayed three hours.

286
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:19,477
C.C., I'll be back in time,
 I promise.

287
00:17:19,477 --> 00:17:21,439
Maxwell, what 
if you miss the plane?

288
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,300
What about all those poor unfortunate
 people who are counting on us?

289
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,661
If you ring that bell one more time,
 I'll ring your neck...

290
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:31,977
Santa.

291
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:48,305
Excuse me.  Pardon me.

292
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:50,805
Silent night, holy night.

293
00:17:52,523 --> 00:17:54,367
Miss Fine, you're late.

294
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:57,888
I'm sorry.  But I don't have
 my watch anymore.  Remember?

295
00:17:57,888 --> 00:18:01,675
Oh, this place is magnificent.

296
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:05,715
Did I miss anything? 
/ Here.  This oughta bring you up to date.

297
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:10,664
Wow, look at the crowds 
at the confessional.

298
00:18:10,664 --> 00:18:13,828
Boy, there were shorter lines
 in Gift Wrap at Macy's.

299
00:18:14,174 --> 00:18:18,041
It's been a rough year for everyone. 
/ Hmm, tell me about it.

300
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,725
I got a few things 
I can get off my chest.

301
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:27,031
Say, Niles, can anyone
 go to the confessionals,
 or is it more like the home club?

302
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:31,642
You in a confessional?  
I'd pay good money to see that.

303
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:33,208
Excuse me.

304
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,880
All is calm, all is bright.

305
00:18:39,271 --> 00:18:41,278
Where's Fran going?

306
00:18:41,278 --> 00:18:43,801
Grace wants to know 
where Fran's going?

307
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:47,207
What's with Fran? 
/ She's gone to confess.

308
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:50,252
She went to play chess.

309
00:18:50,252 --> 00:18:52,667
She went to undress.

310
00:18:56,087 --> 00:18:59,156
Forgive me, Father, 
for I have shopped.

311
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:05,635
Gee, I don't know the penance for that. 
 I suppose you could say ten Hail Macy's.

312
00:19:06,892 --> 00:19:09,035
Good one, Padre.

313
00:19:09,035 --> 00:19:13,270
Oh, these benches are really uncomfortable.  
I guess you don't want people to stay long, huh?

314
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,155
Stay as long as you like. 
 I'm on till midnight.

315
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:20,486
Father Donahue got 
Christmas week off.  Again.

316
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:26,142
I know how you feel. 
 I'm working Christmas myself.

317
00:19:26,142 --> 00:19:30,570
And I was really looking forward to it,
 too, but now it's just gonna be awful.

318
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,628
I mean, the father is in Washington, 
and the kids don't believe in Santa.

319
00:19:34,628 --> 00:19:38,495
I'm in hock up to my ears.  
I just don't know what to do.

320
00:19:38,495 --> 00:19:41,903
I hear the Fountainbleu is 
nice this time of year.

321
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:45,273
At least Father Donahue 
says it is.

322
00:19:46,196 --> 00:19:50,518
Oh, Father, you have more 
experience at this than I do.

323
00:19:50,518 --> 00:19:53,714
Does Christmas ever live up
 to one's expectations?

324
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:56,257
That depends on what one expects.

325
00:19:56,257 --> 00:19:58,808
Oh, you're good.

326
00:19:59,804 --> 00:20:03,480
You see, that's why they shop 
Father Donahue off to Florida

327
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,077
and you're working 
Saint Patty's Christmas Eve.

328
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:09,827
There's someone in here.

329
00:20:10,421 --> 00:20:13,530
Miss, Miss, Miss Fine, it's me.
  May, may I come in?

330
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,372
Oh, Mister Sheffield. 
 What are you doing here?

331
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:21,894
Well, my flight was delayed.  
Look, Miss Fine, Niles told me 
how I got you in trouble.

332
00:20:21,894 --> 00:20:24,771
You've been so generous toward 
me and, and the children,

333
00:20:24,771 --> 00:20:27,412
and you've really made us a very 
special Christmas this year,

334
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:32,374
and I don't see why it should 
cost you your grandmother's watch.

335
00:20:32,374 --> 00:20:35,184
Oh, Mister Sheffield.

336
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:37,323
And I got the name
 of the pawnshop from Val.

337
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:39,634
Oh, I don't know what to say.

338
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:42,810
This isn't my grandmother's watch.

339
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,514
What?  Oh, dear.

340
00:20:45,514 --> 00:20:48,033
I seem to have really
 made a mess of things.

341
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:53,236
Oh, don't feel bad.  At least
 I still have my beautiful...

342
00:20:54,472 --> 00:20:56,272
Ow!

343
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:07,448
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mister Sheffield.

344
00:21:07,448 --> 00:21:11,508
That's quite all right, Miss Fine. 
 It's not so much the pain as the humiliation.

345
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:15,387
Oh, well now there's nothing 
to be humiliated about.

346
00:21:15,387 --> 00:21:19,226
Although they really should 
get backs for these gowns.

347
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:22,496
I hope C.C. will be able to 
handle the benefit by herself.

348
00:21:22,496 --> 00:21:24,264
Well, she should be
 in the air by now.

349
00:21:24,264 --> 00:21:26,807
Oh, there go the friendly skies.

350
00:21:27,532 --> 00:21:29,503
Gracie, don't decorate Father.

351
00:21:29,503 --> 00:21:31,301
Oh, that's all right.

352
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:36,833
Let me go!  It's Christmas Eve 
and I've got things to do!

353
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,599
Don't you know who I am?!

354
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:41,769
Yes, we do.  
And we've been good all year.

355
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:45,844
Why don't you be good and lie still
 till the medication kicks in?

356
00:21:46,117 --> 00:21:52,181
What happened to him? 
/ Some lady at the airport 
knocked him out with his own bell.

357
00:21:54,343 --> 00:21:57,593
And my ears are still ringing.

358
00:21:58,431 --> 00:22:03,238
Thank you, Santa, 
for all my Christmas presents.

359
00:22:07,062 --> 00:22:10,630
What are you thanking him for?
 / Yeah, I thought you didn't
 believe in Santa Claus?

360
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:14,241
Well I do now because 
my Christmas wish came true.

361
00:22:14,241 --> 00:22:18,364
What wish, sweetheart? 
/ That you'd be with us for Christmas.

362
00:22:18,364 --> 00:22:19,596
Oh...

363
00:22:19,596 --> 00:22:23,399
Funny.  That was my wish, too.

364
00:22:23,924 --> 00:22:28,877
Oh, isn't this a positive 
way to look at this disaster?

365
00:22:30,494 --> 00:22:33,421
Oh listen, it's Christmas.

366
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:35,835
Oh, and we're altogether,

367
00:22:35,835 --> 00:22:38,384
and we're happy, 
and we're healthy.

368
00:22:38,384 --> 00:22:40,827
Well, most of us.

369
00:22:41,102 --> 00:22:48,551
Merry Christmas. 
/ Merry Christmas.

370
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:53,911
Say, maybe we should invite the old man. 
No one should be alone on Christmas.

371
00:22:53,911 --> 00:22:58,241
Hey, Santa, are you decent? Funny.

372
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:01,170
Ah!  Where'd he go?

373
00:23:02,856 --> 00:23:06,535
Ho, ho, ho, ho...

374
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,404
I gotta lie down.

375
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:17,193
And a partridge in a pear tree.

376
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:20,500
Oh, that's a weird song.  I mean,
 five golden rings I can understand.

377
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,735
Ten lords a leaping, I am there. 
 But what's with all the birds?

378
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:28,399
I mean, French hens, turtle doves, 
six geese a laying. 
 Who wants to see that?

379
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:29,724
Miss Fine!

380
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:33,727
Happy holidays. 
/ And thanks for watching.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
