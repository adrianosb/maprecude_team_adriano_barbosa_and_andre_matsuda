1
00:00:09,637 --> 00:00:12,284
Oh, if they ring those little
 bells one more time,

2
00:00:12,284 --> 00:00:15,184
I'll wring their little necks.

3
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:21,309
Niles, they're poor sick children 
who need our care and compassion.

4
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:25,120
Enough with the bells already! 
 We're not deaf!

5
00:00:25,494 --> 00:00:27,342
Until now.

6
00:00:27,342 --> 00:00:31,569
Sorry.  Oh, three kids
 sick all at once.

7
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:33,695
I don't think I can
 last much longer.

8
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:38,680
Well, look on the bright side.  Eventually,
 they'll either go back to school or die.

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,151
School, thank God for school.

10
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:46,170
I need those seven hours
 of personal time.

11
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,668
I mean, how else can I continue
 to be the bright and vivacious nanny

12
00:00:50,668 --> 00:00:54,934
that you all know and love if I have to
 spend all day taking care of those kids!

13
00:00:56,552 --> 00:01:01,082
All right, darling,
 how do we feel?

14
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:04,696
What took you so long? 
/ Ice cream, juice...

15
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:07,376
I need the remote control.

16
00:01:08,853 --> 00:01:12,014
Toast in the shape 
of a horsey.

17
00:01:12,014 --> 00:01:14,739
What kind of a horse is this?

18
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,145
A gelding.

19
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,373
Whenever I was feeling a bit wonky,
 mama used to bundle me up
 and seat me by the fire,

20
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:28,139
not too close, and bring me tea
 and crumpets and little soldiers 
cut out of toast.

21
00:01:28,139 --> 00:01:31,443
Niles, you know we love you.

22
00:01:31,443 --> 00:01:36,246
Don't share.  Better you
 should remain an enigma.

23
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:40,610
Silly me, after sitting through endless 
stories about your multifarious relatives.

24
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,032
Hey, only my Uncle Harvey 
is multifarious.

25
00:01:44,032 --> 00:01:49,943
When he sang Somewhere Over the Rainbow,
 you'd swear Judy was in the room.

26
00:02:39,255 --> 00:02:43,017
Maxwell, I am terribly concerned
 about the children.

27
00:02:43,017 --> 00:02:45,340
Oh, why, thank you, C.C.,
 but it's only the flu.

28
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,817
Yes, but if you catch it, who will
 I take to my sorority reunion?

29
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:54,369
Is that this weekend? 
 Let me see if I'm free.

30
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:57,247
Maxwell, you tease.

31
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,484
You wouldn't leave
 me hanging.

32
00:02:59,484 --> 00:03:02,929
No, we'd cut you down
 in a week or two.

33
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,090
I just can't wait to show you 
off to all my old friends,

34
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,004
with their handsome doctor husbands 
and their two-point-five perfect children

35
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:17,455
they juggled while earning
 multiple Phd's.

36
00:03:17,455 --> 00:03:20,102
Oh, C.C., there's no
 need to be jealous.

37
00:03:20,102 --> 00:03:24,100
You have a successful career 
and...and...

38
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,416
Well, successful career.

39
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:31,105
Yes, how do you
 balance them both?

40
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:35,037
Knock, knock.
 / Were you just with the children?

41
00:03:35,037 --> 00:03:36,743
Yeah.  Why?

42
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,675
Mmm... Lysol. 
 My mother's fragrance.

43
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,809
Can't be too careful.  
Germs everywhere.  Nobody touch me.

44
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:47,777
We'll try to restrain ourselves.

45
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,622
So, Maxwell, what do you think I should 
wear to the reunion Friday night?

46
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:56,601
Well, Miss Fine's clothes always make
 a statement.  Why don't you ask her?

47
00:03:56,601 --> 00:04:01,948
Why don't I just pop into K-Mart and 
pick something out of the Jaclyn Smith collection?

48
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:05,234
Meanwhile, she's making 
millions of dollars

49
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:09,472
and they said Kate Jackson
 was the smart one.

50
00:04:09,472 --> 00:04:12,182
Where are you going? 
/ My sorority reunion.

51
00:04:12,182 --> 00:04:15,761
Oh, reunions are so much fun.

52
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:18,180
You get to see how 
old everyone got,

53
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,209
who's had face work, 
who's not married...

54
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:27,061
Oh, you'll be the belle of the ball.

55
00:04:28,258 --> 00:04:30,972
So, Miss Fine, are the children
 feeling any better?

56
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:34,960
Oh, yes, except for Gracie. 
 I think I need to take her to the doctor.

57
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,385
Maybe we should call the doctor 
and have him come to the house.

58
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:39,973
This is New York.  You can't get
 a doctor to make a house call

59
00:04:39,973 --> 00:04:42,913
if your spleen was sitting
 next to you on the couch.

60
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:48,053
Miss Fine, are you feeling
 all right? / Oh, yeah.

61
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:51,952
It's just a little frog in
 my throat.  No biggie...

62
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:06,403
Oh, doctors' scales are always
 six and a half pounds over.

63
00:05:06,403 --> 00:05:09,351
Fran, how come they make 
you wait so long?

64
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,865
To give you a chance to stock up
 on your beauty supplies.

65
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:15,160
See, these are great 
for astringent.

66
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,172
Oh, these are excellent for
 doing your cuticles.

67
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:24,227
And these, well, if I don't take them,
 I'm sure I'll regret it later.

68
00:05:24,227 --> 00:05:26,789
I'm scared.
 / Oh, sweetie,

69
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:29,563
there's nothing 
to be scared about.

70
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:33,126
Mommy, I don't want a shot!

71
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:35,996
I think I feel better. 
 Let's go.

72
00:05:36,568 --> 00:05:39,221
Oh, honey, would you trust me?

73
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:41,599
Believe me, this is 
an absolute cinch.

74
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:45,144
Just be glad that you don't have 
stirrups like at my doctor.

75
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,957
Your doctor has a pony?

76
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:51,857
No, honey, these are for...
 Oh, never mind.

77
00:05:51,857 --> 00:05:55,120
You'll discover the joys 
of womanhood soon enough.

78
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,907
Hey, Gracie.
 / Hi.

79
00:05:56,907 --> 00:05:59,262
Hi.  I'm Doctor Link. 
 I'm covering for Doctor Sherwin.

80
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:01,227
Don't worry. 
 I'm very gentle.

81
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,471
Fran says I don't want
 a gentle doctor.

82
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:06,083
That's gentile.

83
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:10,514
Okay, Gracie,
 I wanna hear you breathe.

84
00:06:10,514 --> 00:06:12,599
You ever seen a stethoscope?

85
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:15,712
Have you ever been
 sued for malpractice?

86
00:06:15,712 --> 00:06:17,733
Gracie!  You haven't, 
have you?

87
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:20,869
We settled out of court.

88
00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:23,787
Okay, I'd like to look 
at your throat.

89
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:27,659
Where are my tongue depressors?

90
00:06:28,284 --> 00:06:32,233
Uh... I may have one. 
 Oh, here, here we go.

91
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,366
Yeah, well, you never know when 
you're gonna run into Monty Hall.

92
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:40,610
Oh, look at all these diplomas.

93
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,256
Harvard, Yale, Columbia. 
 Couldn't settle in, huh?

94
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,009
Actually, I'm certified
 in several specialties.

95
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:52,289
Oh, is there a Mrs. Link? 
/ We're divorced.

96
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:54,428
Oh, so she's like the missing link.

97
00:06:56,712 --> 00:06:59,684
Gee, that's a new one. 
/ Yeah, right.

98
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:02,923
Okay, Gracie, can I get you to 
open your mouth? / Uh-uh.

99
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,551
Oh, come on, honey, 
like this.  Ahhh...

100
00:07:07,463 --> 00:07:08,719
Ahhh...

101
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:15,222
Okay.  Well, you just have the tail end
 of that nasty flu.  You're gonna be fine.

102
00:07:15,222 --> 00:07:19,881
You, on the other hand, 
you have a nasty looking throat.

103
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:22,429
Oh, Doc, no, it's just
 a little tickle.

104
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:24,979
Honestly, I never get sick.
 Healthy as a horse.

105
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:27,223
Come on, Grace, let's get
 out of here. . Say ahhh...

106
00:07:27,223 --> 00:07:30,547
Uh-uh. 
/ Like this Fran.  Ahhh...

107
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:34,129
Ahhh...

108
00:07:34,676 --> 00:07:38,692
Hmm... I'm afraid I'm gonna
 have to take those tonsils out.

109
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,004
Yeah?  Well, unless, you're talking
 about dinner and dancing,

110
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:43,277
they're not interested.

111
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,106
I don't have a good feeling
 about this place.

112
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,302
Oh, Miss Fine, this is one of the 
top medical institutions in the country.

113
00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:59,806
Meanwhile, they've got 
no padded hangers,

114
00:07:59,806 --> 00:08:03,435
no hair conditioner, not even
 a little sewing kit.

115
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:07,270
But they do turn down your bed and 
leave a valium on your pillow.

116
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,082
Oh, all right.  Brighton, get me
 some hangers from the old lady.

117
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:14,833
But she's asleep. 
/ So?  She won't miss them.  Go, grab.

118
00:08:15,613 --> 00:08:17,926
Fran, you know, you're only 
gonna be here overnight.

119
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:20,838
Listen, this is the closest I'll ever 
get to a large group of doctors.

120
00:08:20,838 --> 00:08:23,805
I promised my mother I'd look
 my best.

121
00:08:23,805 --> 00:08:26,238
You know, Fran, you're being really
 brave about this surgery.

122
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:28,221
I'd be afraid I was gonna die.

123
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:30,981
Aren't visiting hours over
 for children?

124
00:08:30,981 --> 00:08:33,072
No one dies from having
 their tonsils out.

125
00:08:33,072 --> 00:08:36,024
Oh, well, that's what they
 told my Aunt Paula.

126
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:39,253
She went in for bursitis, 
but she developed a bed sore,

127
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:43,292
that turned into phlebitis and
 caused a massive stroke.

128
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:47,946
If they ever settle her case, she'll
 be the richest vegetable in Bayside.

129
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:50,493
Oh, I love this vest. 
 Can I have it?...

130
00:08:50,493 --> 00:08:53,653
You know, if you don't make it.

131
00:08:53,653 --> 00:08:56,183
I'll leave it for you in my will.

132
00:08:56,183 --> 00:08:59,302
If you haven't promised your 
Reba McIntyre c.d's to anyone...

133
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:02,766
Can't you all wait until 
they hang the tag on my toe?

134
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:04,893
Will you all stop being
 so morbid? / Yeah.

135
00:09:04,893 --> 00:09:07,561
There's absolutely no risk
 involved. / Right.

136
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:10,761
Your life insurance is
 paid up, isn't it?

137
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,572
I'm Nurse Smith.  Get in bed.

138
00:09:14,572 --> 00:09:17,735
I'm not the patient. 
/ I know.

139
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:21,731
Here, sign these. 
/ What are they?

140
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:24,844
Release forms. 
 Don't talk.

141
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:27,525
That's all it takes?

142
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,403
I should have tried 
that ages ago.

143
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,368
Hey, what's this
 about complications?

144
00:09:32,368 --> 00:09:35,358
Oh, you know, in case they
 leave in a sponge or...

145
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:40,731
Oh, does that happen often?  I already
 retain water two weeks out of the month.

146
00:09:40,731 --> 00:09:44,831
You're going to be just fine. 
 Visiting hours are over.  Say goodbye.

147
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:46,456
You mean goodnight.

148
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:49,893
Whatever.  
I'm off in fifteen minutes.

149
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:52,047
Well, goodnight, Miss Fine.

150
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:55,578
Now you get some rest and we'll be back
 to see you before the operation tomorrow.

151
00:09:55,578 --> 00:09:57,511
Goodnight. 
/ Goodnight, Fran.

152
00:09:57,511 --> 00:09:58,889
Goodnight, Miss Fine.
 / Goodnight.

153
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,123
Remember, Fran, afterwards you can
 have all the ice cream you want.

154
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:05,474
Swell, if I live, I'll be hippy.

155
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,690
Here, Fran, I thought you might
 want someone to sleep with.

156
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,869
Oh, how sweet.  And look 
at his nice furry back.

157
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:14,436
You must come from
 my neighborhood.

158
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:17,216
Thank you, angel.

159
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,041
You gonna be okay? 
/ Hey, what's my last name?

160
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,148
Fine.
 / So I'll be fine.

161
00:10:22,148 --> 00:10:24,097
And I'll take good
 care of Teddy, too.

162
00:10:24,097 --> 00:10:27,347
Just try not to drool. 
 He hates that.

163
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:35,688
Hey, listen you, you think about getting 
frisky during the night, don't wake me.

164
00:10:46,074 --> 00:10:51,901
I'm having an operation tomorrow,
 so I'm not allowed to eat anything.

165
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,053
But you go ahead.

166
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,542
Mmm... Turkey.

167
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:03,079
I wonder if
 it's real or pressed.

168
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:07,230
Well, maybe
 I'll just taste.

169
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:13,118
Oh, you're not missing anything.

170
00:11:13,118 --> 00:11:17,161
No.  You know, you're
 a great little listener.

171
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:23,709
When my mother had her hysterectomy, 
oh did she have a loud mouth roommate.

172
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:28,564
I swear, after one day she wanted
 to reach up and yank it out herself.

173
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,776
Oh look, Hard Copy.  The Menendez boys.

174
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:38,071
Oh, you know, I don't get it.  
They don't have the brains 
to just leave home,

175
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:42,569
but they can figure out how to put
 their pants on over their shackles.

176
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:46,221
See if I can get
 some volume going here...

177
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:53,797
Hey, this thing's
 not working...

178
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,974
What's with this?...

179
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:09,931
What happened in here? 
/ Nothing!  Nothing!

180
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:11,671
I didn't do anything. 
 We were just talking.

181
00:12:11,671 --> 00:12:14,291
Her over there, me over here, 
with all this space in between us,

182
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,270
and then all of a sudden
 all hell broke loose.

183
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,761
Excuse me, sir, when you get 
a chance I could use a remote.

184
00:12:29,786 --> 00:12:37,225
...and finally, "Do you ever lead a man
 on with no intention of following through?"

185
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:39,200
Oh, never.

186
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:41,943
Well, occasionally.

187
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:46,448
All right, always, always.

188
00:12:47,628 --> 00:12:50,186
Oh, never.  Who's gonna know?

189
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,795
Come in.

190
00:12:54,787 --> 00:12:58,587
Oh good, she's fine. 
/ Sure.  They haven't cut her open yet.

191
00:12:58,587 --> 00:13:00,446
Yeah.  That's when things
 can go really wrong.

192
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,667
One slip of that scalpel and...
 Oh, I'll tell you later.

193
00:13:05,142 --> 00:13:08,029
All right, you've seen her.  
She's fine.  Let's go.

194
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:12,413
Oh, Miss Babcock, 
you look gorgeous.

195
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:15,592
Much too young to be
 going to a reunion.

196
00:13:15,592 --> 00:13:18,439
Of redwoods maybe.

197
00:13:19,207 --> 00:13:23,787
Dear Niles, always so witty. 
 Especially for a servant.

198
00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:27,911
At least when I offer
 something people take it.

199
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:32,343
C.C., aren't you gonna
 wish Fran good luck?

200
00:13:32,343 --> 00:13:33,858
All right.

201
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:38,013
Nanny Fine, I know you're scared
 now, but just remember

202
00:13:38,013 --> 00:13:43,779
when you wake up from surgery, you'll 
find that the excruciating agony
 of an adult tonsillectomy

203
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:48,583
is far worse than anything
 you can imagine.  Good luck.

204
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,938
I'm out of here. 
/ No, now, Miss Fine.

205
00:13:51,938 --> 00:13:55,870
Would, would it, would it make you feel 
better if we stayed through the surgery?

206
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,997
Oh, no.  She's a big girl. 
 She doesn't need us to stay.

207
00:13:58,997 --> 00:14:01,315
Sure she does.
 / Hmm...

208
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,346
Well where are those parents 
you're always babbling about?

209
00:14:04,346 --> 00:14:07,763
They happened to be on their
 annual pilgrimage to the Holy Land.

210
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,552
Jerusalem? 
/ Miami.

211
00:14:11,423 --> 00:14:12,900
Maxwell,

212
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:17,750
who's more important,
 me or the nanny?

213
00:14:24,878 --> 00:14:27,974
C.C., for heaven's sake, 
she's going into surgery.

214
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:32,242
You go on, I'll catch up later. 
/ I can't show up without an escort!

215
00:14:32,242 --> 00:14:36,009
Why don't you just inflate one
 like you usually do?

216
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:46,372
And these are my beautiful twins
 playing with me at work.

217
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:50,251
Thank God NASA has day care.
 / So does the U.N.

218
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:54,585
Yo know my little brutus can say
 'jungle gym' in twelve languages.

219
00:14:54,585 --> 00:14:58,499
C.C., does your employer
 provide day care?

220
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:01,834
Well, actually,
 I don't have any children yet.

221
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,388
Oh...

222
00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:08,068
But you are married?

223
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:10,342
Well, not yet.

224
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,838
Oh...

225
00:15:18,394 --> 00:15:24,126
Okay now just relax and count 
backwards from one hundred.

226
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:25,613
One hundred,

227
00:15:25,613 --> 00:15:27,243
ninety-nine,

228
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:29,365
ninety-eight,

229
00:15:29,365 --> 00:15:34,236
ninety-seven bottles
 of beer on the wall...

230
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:39,201
Quick, I've got the release forms, 
you take the pen. 
/ ...ninety-seven bottles of beer...

231
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:42,872
You sure this is legal?
 / Oh, we always get them this way.

232
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:49,088
Oh, now I've lost the children!

233
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:53,349
Shh!  Don't tell Mister Sheffield.

234
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:57,315
It's all right, Miss Fine.
  The children are having dinner in the cafeteria.

235
00:15:57,315 --> 00:16:00,339
Oh, I hope they don't order turkey.

236
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:03,079
It's pressed.

237
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:06,482
She's, uh, dead to the world.

238
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:10,488
Oh, I'm dead?  Oh, that's so sad.

239
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:16,242
I want Maggie to have
 all my clothes.

240
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:20,573
And I want Gracie to have 
all of my Barbi dolls.

241
00:16:20,573 --> 00:16:24,105
About your Reba McIntyre c.d.'s.
 / Niles!

242
00:16:24,105 --> 00:16:26,775
Man, hold on.
 / Sorry, sir.

243
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:28,263
Beep-beep.

244
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:33,299
Shifter Medfield.

245
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:34,831
Oh, I believe 
that's you, sir.

246
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:37,776
Shister Medfield,

247
00:16:37,776 --> 00:16:42,895
I want you to have me...

248
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:52,990
All set?

249
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,013
Where's my pen?
 / Here she blows.

250
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,803
I'm surprised she hasn't 
taken her own tonsils out.

251
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:03,083
All right, come on, young lady.

252
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,398
We'll have you eating ice cream
 before you know it.

253
00:17:05,398 --> 00:17:07,937
Oh, uh, uh, Doctor,
 perhaps while you're in there,

254
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:11,720
if it's not too much trouble,
 you could have a look at her adenoids.

255
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,397
Why?  Do they bother her?
 / Well, not so much her.

256
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:19,647
We have a theory that perhaps
 something's loose in there.

257
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:23,342
Yes.  Anything that jiggles,
 tighten it up.

258
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,314
Well, off you go.

259
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:27,261
Mister Medfield...

260
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:31,718
Yeah, everything's gonna be just fine.
 Don't you worry.  I'll be here
 when you wake up.

261
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:36,136
Shister Medfield, I love you.

262
00:17:48,418 --> 00:17:52,186
C.C., darling, please join us.

263
00:17:52,186 --> 00:17:56,071
Your Maxwell has obviously been 
detained by something more important.

264
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:58,713
Oh, he'll be here any minute.

265
00:17:58,713 --> 00:18:04,451
He adores me.  Absolutely worships 
the ground I walk on.

266
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:08,229
So I guess this evening he'll
 be worshipping from afar?

267
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:13,481
You know, I think it's so nice 
that you two are still friends.

268
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:18,642
I thought you'd never forgive her 
after that weekend in Barbados with Bill.

269
00:18:18,642 --> 00:18:20,398
My Bill?

270
00:18:21,075 --> 00:18:24,022
I thought you knew.  Oops.

271
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:38,063
You know, if you squeeze this I.V.,
 blood comes out of the old lady and into the bag.

272
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,138
Brighton!

273
00:18:40,138 --> 00:18:41,922
Just a theory.

274
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:44,987
She came through just fine.
  She'll be up in a couple of minutes.

275
00:18:44,987 --> 00:18:46,297
Oh, splendid... All right...
 Fine... Good...

276
00:18:46,297 --> 00:18:49,358
Oh by the way, her adenoids
 are quite remarkable.

277
00:18:49,358 --> 00:18:52,766
I'd remove them, but I'm afraid 
her head might cave in.

278
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,007
All right, children, off you go, down
 to the gift shop and get some flowers.

279
00:18:58,007 --> 00:19:01,028
And I think she wants some candy.

280
00:19:01,637 --> 00:19:03,552
And a Playboy.

281
00:19:04,464 --> 00:19:06,536
It was worth a shot.

282
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:08,787
Niles? / Sir?

283
00:19:08,787 --> 00:19:12,259
I didn't want to say anything
 in front of the children, 
but I am worried about Miss Fine.

284
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:14,035
But the doctor said 
she was all right.

285
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:17,906
Well, not that.  Oh, good god, man,
 you heard her.  She's in love with me.

286
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,702
Oh, sir, she was a bit woozy.  
I wouldn't take it too seriously.

287
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:24,293
But I must.  Poor little thing,
 pining away all this time,

288
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:27,688
and I never even noticed.  Well,
 I should have seen the signs,

289
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:31,251
I suppose, but I, I always thought 
of her as just the nanny.

290
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:36,346
Well, a wonderful nanny to be sure. 
 Loving and wise in her way.

291
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:38,473
Funny, sweet.

292
00:19:38,473 --> 00:19:42,509
But just the nanny?
 / Well, exactly.

293
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:46,730
Oh, this is all so awkward.  
Not that I can blame her really.

294
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,299
I suppose she was just dazzled.

295
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:52,613
You are quite a catch, sir.

296
00:19:52,613 --> 00:19:55,626
Oh, the last thing in the 
world I want is to hurt her.

297
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:59,751
I, I, I just hope I can let 
her down gently.

298
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:05,162
I love you...

299
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:09,783
I love you, too.

300
00:20:10,215 --> 00:20:13,523
She was the most popular 
girl in Recovery.

301
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:18,063
Hey, skinny,
 I love you, too.

302
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,800
I don't want to hear it.
 / Not a word, sir.

303
00:20:23,195 --> 00:20:24,593
Excuse me.

304
00:20:36,675 --> 00:20:39,943
C.C., I am so sorry I'm late.

305
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,620
The surgery took a lot longer
 than I was expecting.

306
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,324
But I'm here now, and ready
 to dazzle them.

307
00:20:45,324 --> 00:20:50,791
Everyone, I want you to meet
 the light of me life,

308
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,563
Maxwell Sheffield.

309
00:21:11,362 --> 00:21:14,000
Would you care for some tea?

310
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:17,730
Ice cream? 
 Coming right up...

311
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:22,375
Now what's the problem?

312
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,311
I need a pot of tea,
 properly strained.

313
00:21:25,311 --> 00:21:28,298
And Miss Fine requires
 more ice cream.

314
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,172
With sprinkles. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

315
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:37,416
Who's idea was it to give
 them those bells anyway.

316
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:44,001
So, Nanny Fine, cat got your tongue.

317
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:50,426
Oh, this is a dream come true.  
I feel like I have died and gone to heaven.

318
00:21:50,426 --> 00:21:53,988
I have that dream, too, 
but you go in the other direction.

319
00:21:58,829 --> 00:22:02,755
Oh, Nanny Fine, let's have
 a little chat.

320
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:06,729
Oh, I forgot,
 you can't talk, can you?

321
00:22:07,387 --> 00:22:11,172
Well, I guess for once you'll 
just have to listen.

322
00:22:28,664 --> 00:22:30,403
Oh, shall I help you unpack?

323
00:22:30,403 --> 00:22:34,351
Oh, that's okay. 
 You can just hold it. Here.

324
00:22:34,872 --> 00:22:37,189
Good to soak your feet...

325
00:22:39,308 --> 00:22:41,403
Very fashionable...

326
00:22:44,985 --> 00:22:47,207
What are you going
 to do with that?

327
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:50,895
I thought I'd make
 it into a nice lamp.
