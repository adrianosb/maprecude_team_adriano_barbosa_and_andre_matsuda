1
00:00:02,943 --> 00:00:05,456
Don't touch me.
/ I'm not touching you.

2
00:00:05,456 --> 00:00:07,874
Fran!
/ I'm not touching her.

3
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:11,741
Well, maybe I should
play the game, too.

4
00:00:11,741 --> 00:00:15,428
I'm not touching you.
Oops. / Ow!

5
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:19,222
Well, guess I'm not as good
at this game as you are.

6
00:00:19,963 --> 00:00:21,017
Hello, everyone.

7
00:00:21,017 --> 00:00:22,577
Hello.
/ Hello.

8
00:00:22,577 --> 00:00:25,959
Brighton, that's amazing.
Can you imitate Niles, too?

9
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:30,915
Daddy, Brighton's not
touching me again.

10
00:00:30,915 --> 00:00:34,597
Brighton, I've told you before
not to not touch your sister.

11
00:00:34,597 --> 00:00:36,654
Now go upstairs, both of you.
Get ready for dinner.

12
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:38,074
Put on something nice.

13
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:39,956
Oh, you're taking
the kids out to dinner?

14
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,757
Where're we going?
I'm gonna need at least an hour.

15
00:00:42,757 --> 00:00:45,875
Actually, we're eating in.
/ Oh, well, than I'm gorgeous.

16
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,408
Good.  Because Chloe Simpson's
coming to supper.

17
00:00:48,408 --> 00:00:53,563
Chloe Simpson, the model?  Seventeen
Magazine?  Dippy-Do?  Oh, my God!

18
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:56,522
Look at me, I'm a schlub.

19
00:00:56,522 --> 00:00:59,040
Miss Fine,
she's just a person.

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,222
No, you're just a person.
I'm just a person.

21
00:01:01,222 --> 00:01:05,222
She's the Psst Girl.

22
00:01:05,222 --> 00:01:06,447
I beg your pardon?

23
00:01:06,447 --> 00:01:08,723
Don't you remember
Psst dry Shampoo,

24
00:01:08,723 --> 00:01:11,525
when your hair was too greasy,
but you didn't wanna wash it,

25
00:01:11,525 --> 00:01:15,694
so you'd spray in some Psst
and it would be great for weeks.

26
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,347
What, did you sleep through
the sixties?

27
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:22,132
No, actually I bathed.

28
00:01:22,464 --> 00:01:25,899
Oh, Niles, there you are, good.
We have a dinner guest arriving
in half-an-hour.

29
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:29,577
Half-an-hour?  What, did your finger
break?  You couldn't have called?

30
00:01:29,577 --> 00:01:32,177
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart,
I got held up in a meeting, I...

31
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:35,078
What am I saying?

32
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:37,885
Niles, we'll have the Chateaubriand,
the asparagus Hollandaise.

33
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:40,518
Get a couple of bottles of the
Rothchild out of the cellar

34
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:45,137
and, oh yes, your hazel nut souffles.
/ Straight away, sir.

35
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:48,583
Well, you're taking this a lot better
than I am.  How do you do it?

36
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,159
Oh, please, Miss Fine,
I'm a trained professional.

37
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:53,730
I have thirty years experience.

38
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:48,875
Why is it whenever someone important is
coming over your hair never comes out big enough?

39
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:52,851
Oh yes, I've been there.

40
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:56,471
Oh, can you believe Chloe Simpson
is coming to my mansion?

41
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:59,005
That's who I'm making dinner for?
/ Uh-huh.

42
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:01,488
Madame Psst?

43
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:07,611
Why did I cook the meat?
Why not throw it to her raw?

44
00:03:07,611 --> 00:03:11,447
Niles, I'm sensing some
hostility here.  Now dish.

45
00:03:11,447 --> 00:03:14,723
Divulge the details of their
torrid love affair

46
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:19,327
which ended with Mister Sheffield's heart,
still beating being torn from his chest?

47
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:21,679
No, I couldn't.

48
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:25,245
Oh, yeah, you know,
it's best left unsaid.

49
00:03:25,245 --> 00:03:27,218
Now don't tell me more.

50
00:03:27,218 --> 00:03:29,561
Not, not if you tortured me

51
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:33,666
would I reveal the way he kept going back
to her for more like a moth to a flame.

52
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,027
An incredibly stupid moth.

53
00:03:36,027 --> 00:03:38,309
Oh, it's just like Liz and Dick.

54
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:40,833
On again, off again.
On again, off again.

55
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,726
Dead. / Hmm...

56
00:03:44,102 --> 00:03:46,437
Niles, you gonna get that?

57
00:03:46,437 --> 00:03:49,513
Maybe if we're very still
she'll go away.

58
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:52,331
Oh, Niles, this over protective
thing is adorable,

59
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:56,015
if not a little sick, but meanwhile
I'm dying to meet her.

60
00:03:57,023 --> 00:03:58,250
Hmm...

61
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:04,141
Oh, Chloe Simpson, are you gorgeous?
Can I take a picture of you?

62
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:09,892
Honey, come on in.  Don't just
stand there.  Step, step.

63
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:13,871
Chloe...
/ Oh, you feel familiar.

64
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:17,814
Oh, Maxwell,
don't you look smashing.

65
00:04:17,814 --> 00:04:20,886
You're still not a bad
looking bird yourself.

66
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:24,276
How long has it been?
/ Oh, twenty years.

67
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:26,408
Well, moving on.

68
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:30,737
Oh, who could ever forget those three
glorious weeks we spent in Cornwell?

69
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,408
We were never in Cornwell.

70
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:34,002
Devon?
/ No.

71
00:04:34,002 --> 00:04:36,796
The cozy little room with the fireplace
and the four poster bed?

72
00:04:36,796 --> 00:04:40,013
No, not me.
/ Well, I had a good time.

73
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:45,930
We were in Luxembourg.
/ I remember it well.

74
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,032
Who's this? / Hmm?  Oh, oh, yes.

75
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:51,977
These are my children...
Uh... Oh...

76
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:54,096
She's back.

77
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:57,281
Brighton, Grace and Maggie.
/ Oh.

78
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:58,359
Hi.

79
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:00,412
You are beautiful.

80
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:02,777
Oh, stop.

81
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:05,686
Have you ever
considered modeling?

82
00:05:05,686 --> 00:05:11,413
Well, actually, I did complete two
years at the Barbizon School.

83
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,626
Uh, Miss Fine, I think she's
talking to Margaret.

84
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:17,745
Oh, well, that's a natural...

85
00:05:19,137 --> 00:05:21,851
Chloe Simpson;
how do you do, darling?

86
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:24,625
Chloe Simpson.
Like the modeling agency?

87
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,501
That's right.  And I'm always
looking for new faces.

88
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:31,238
Well, if she finds one,
she'll give you a call.

89
00:05:31,238 --> 00:05:36,574
Darling, be nice to your sister.
Hmm?  / Okay.

90
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:43,589
You know, not to gush, but you
were my idol. / Oh...

91
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:48,713
This woman dated the Beatles!
All of them. / Not Ringo.

92
00:05:48,713 --> 00:05:51,559
Oh, well, honey, who could
blame you?  I mean,

93
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:55,915
with all his money why he never
fixed that schnooz.

94
00:05:55,915 --> 00:06:00,303
Streisand I understand,
she needs it to sing.

95
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:05,328
Maxwell, what an aqueous nanny
you have. / Oh, thank you.

96
00:06:05,328 --> 00:06:08,422
I try to get to the gym
at least once a week.

97
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:13,091
Niles, will supper be long?
/ Interminable, sir.

98
00:06:20,028 --> 00:06:24,269
C.C., I've decided to hold the backers
auditions in Southampton this weekend.

99
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:28,404
Four hours on the Long Island
Expressway?  I would rather die.

100
00:06:28,404 --> 00:06:32,522
Well, not to worry.  I've asked
Chloe to come with me.

101
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:38,946
Oh, oh, Southampton?
Oh, marvelous!  All right!

102
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:43,853
Oh, I won't hear of it.  No, Chloe
knows lots of people there,
so I'm letting you off the hook.

103
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:47,862
I don't wanna be let off the hook.
/ She wants her hooks in.

104
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,502
It's just that if you're
having a business meeting,

105
00:06:53,502 --> 00:06:56,091
you'd think you'd wanna take
your business partner.

106
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:59,005
Yes, you'd think, wouldn't you?

107
00:06:59,908 --> 00:07:02,935
Niles, that'll be all.
/ Hm-hmm.

108
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:06,637
Oh, C.C., don't be jealous.

109
00:07:06,637 --> 00:07:09,651
Look, Chloe and I might want to take
a little walk down memory lane,

110
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:13,247
but you and I will always
be business partners.

111
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:14,905
Groovy.

112
00:07:15,953 --> 00:07:18,138
Can I come in?

113
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:20,524
Miss Fine, come on down.

114
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,426
Have you been to the Hamptons?
I hear everyone's going.

115
00:07:23,426 --> 00:07:27,455
Excuse me.  Do you need a Pamprin?

116
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:35,881
No!

117
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:41,657
You sure?

118
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:45,578
All right.  Must be a full moon.

119
00:07:47,302 --> 00:07:51,260
Meanwhile, the cookie jar's empty
and Gracie needs tights.

120
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,180
Really?  What color?

121
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,334
Oh, she needs a forest green and
a navy... What do you care?

122
00:07:56,334 --> 00:07:59,177
I'm interested in anyone who
isn't Chloe Simpson.

123
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:02,845
Oh, doesn't she look fabulous!

124
00:08:02,845 --> 00:08:06,487
Oh, why weren't you there last night?
How come you didn't invite her?

125
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:09,815
Oh, I could have had a V-Eight.

126
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:14,591
Hello...

127
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,030
Oh, hello, Chloe.

128
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,404
Hello, Chloe.

129
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:24,275
You know, your face could
freeze like that.

130
00:08:24,275 --> 00:08:28,361
Oh, well, this is all
a bit sudden I...

131
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:31,542
well, I, I really don't
know what to think.

132
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:33,774
Maybe she proposed.

133
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:35,706
Where would that leave you?

134
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:37,975
Same place, really.

135
00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:41,433
Let, let, let me think about it.

136
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,690
I'll call you back.  Bye.

137
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,614
No, no.  you hang up first....

138
00:08:47,957 --> 00:08:50,947
No, you...

139
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:55,558
Well, I know I'm
a little nauseous.

140
00:08:56,631 --> 00:08:59,490
Chloe, I'm not hanging up.

141
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,130
Oh, were you through?
/ Apparently.

142
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,490
Well, Chloe has set up a test
for Maggie with a photographer.

143
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,729
She thinks Maggie could be
a top model. / Really?!

144
00:09:14,729 --> 00:09:17,999
Oh, now she's pretending to be
interested in the children.

145
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:21,477
That woman is so transparent.

146
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,396
Yeah, but what a piece of glass.

147
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,521
Oh, I can't wait to tell Maggie.

148
00:09:29,263 --> 00:09:32,410
Miss, Miss Fine, Miss Fine,
I haven't said yes yet.

149
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,679
Yeah.  But you're going to.
Thank God my father didn't stop me

150
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,412
when the Barbizon scout picked me
out of a crowd at Woolworths.

151
00:09:41,328 --> 00:09:44,857
And you know, they don't take
just anybody's money.

152
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:48,338
Sorry.  I, I tried to follow you.

153
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:53,629
Oh, Maggie, Chloe Simpson just called.
She wants to set up a modeling test for you.

154
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:57,753
Oh, I can't believe it!
/ We're gonna be a model!

155
00:09:58,104 --> 00:10:00,124
Oh, I'm gonna go
call all my friends.

156
00:10:00,124 --> 00:10:02,780
Oh... You made the right decision.

157
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,029
When, when exactly did I do that?

158
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:07,081
Oh, would you just trust me?

159
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:10,523
It'll be great for her,
and she's got nothing to lose.

160
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:13,616
Miss Fine, tell me, why didn't you
pursue a career in modeling?

161
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:16,735
Oh, they all expect you
to sleep around.

162
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:34,387
Oh, Fran, I think
I sprained my cheek.

163
00:10:34,727 --> 00:10:37,999
Now you should have
warmed up first.

164
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:40,764
Oh, Mags, I'm so excited for you.

165
00:10:40,764 --> 00:10:42,795
'Cause you know
I used to be a model.

166
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:45,770
Oh, really?  What did you model?
/ Feet.

167
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,379
All the Fines have
fabulous feet.

168
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:52,829
There's not a corn, bunion
or fungus among us.

169
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:54,704
Oh, Fran, I'm so nervous.

170
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:56,486
I mean, what if
I'm not good at this?

171
00:10:56,486 --> 00:10:59,820
Then I win twenty bucks.
Gracie has a lot of faith in you.

172
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,225
Where did you get
twenty bucks from, miss?

173
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:05,422
I won it when Maggie didn't
make cheerleader.

174
00:11:05,422 --> 00:11:08,273
I don't know what
I was thinking.

175
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:12,636
Oh, forget them.  Come on, here's
the most important thing.

176
00:11:12,636 --> 00:11:18,333
You have to look subtle, natural
and understated.  Like this.

177
00:11:20,474 --> 00:11:22,728
Well, that doesn't
look very natural.

178
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:25,692
Yeah, but look at my feet.

179
00:11:26,474 --> 00:11:30,471
Oh, they still have
so much left to say.

180
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:32,758
Fran, you're so great
to do this for me.

181
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,207
Oh, sweetheart, we're
just getting started.

182
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:37,682
I have so much wisdom to impart.

183
00:11:37,682 --> 00:11:41,240
Like how to purse your lips to
get that little pouty look.

184
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,213
How to smell cauliflower, you know,
for that "who cares about you" look.

185
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:48,709
And then the best look of all.

186
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,074
What's that for?

187
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:53,956
That's for when they give you
the check for the other two looks.

188
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,574
Ah, just the woman
I've been looking for.

189
00:11:58,574 --> 00:12:01,045
Oh, I didn't do it.
Niles left it on.

190
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:03,846
What? / Nothing.

191
00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:07,208
Ahh.  I meant Maggie.  Hello,
sweetheart. / Hello, Daddy.

192
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,109
Fern?
/ Fran.

193
00:12:09,109 --> 00:12:12,111
Are you sure?
/ I'm almost positive.

194
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:15,735
How's my bright new star?
/ Oh, fabulous.

195
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,234
I've been giving her tips all afternoon,
and later I'm gonna take her upstairs,

196
00:12:19,234 --> 00:12:23,258
show her how to do her hair, make-up.
/ No!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

197
00:12:23,258 --> 00:12:28,540
No! / My stylist is waiting for us
at Barney's Designer Floor right now.

198
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,344
Come on, sweetheart,
I'll get your coat.

199
00:12:30,344 --> 00:12:33,151
Oh, Daddy, I can't believe it.
This is so exciting.

200
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,345
And I know just who to thank
for it. / Oh...

201
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:41,025
Chloe! / My pleasure, darling.

202
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:43,692
I'll take it from here.

203
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:47,505
Yeah.  And I could tell you
just where to put it, too.

204
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:55,315
I mean, who does that Chloe
Simpson think she is?

205
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:59,410
The nerve of that woman trespassing
on my field of expertise.

206
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,227
And, uh, what exactly
would that be?

207
00:13:02,227 --> 00:13:05,228
Glamour!

208
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:09,065
This reminds me of that
movie The Turning Point.

209
00:13:09,065 --> 00:13:13,424
Except they were dancers, and one
was a mother, and they were old friends.

210
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:16,337
I should really rent that again.

211
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,146
I haven't seen Maxwell
in three days.

212
00:13:21,146 --> 00:13:24,536
I don't know why I bother
coming over anymore...

213
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:26,632
Aren't you gonna say
anything obnoxious?

214
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:29,662
I wouldn't kick
a dog when she's down.

215
00:13:30,867 --> 00:13:33,736
I don't know what
you're talking about.

216
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:36,778
I am perfectly fine.

217
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:42,465
He's taking her to Southampton
instead of me! / Oh, honey...

218
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:45,918
It's just a business trip.

219
00:13:45,918 --> 00:13:51,144
Now how many times have you gone
away with him and gotten nowhere.

220
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:55,380
Here.  Here.

221
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,852
Just plain tomato juice?
Don't you have anything hard?

222
00:13:58,852 --> 00:14:01,122
Not for you.

223
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:14,080
Look what the years have
done to that Chloe.

224
00:14:14,434 --> 00:14:18,746
Absolutely nothing.
Oh...I hate her.

225
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:24,301
Do you think she's had...
/ Asians?

226
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:30,771
I don't know.
She's had everybody else.

227
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:34,649
No.  Surgery.

228
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:39,512
Oh, honey, please. They did
less work on Mount Rushmore.

229
00:14:54,404 --> 00:14:57,200
Um, excuse me, nanny person.

230
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,642
Please, please, stand over here.
I can't see over your hair.

231
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:08,141
Oh, thanks, Pepe.

232
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:11,077
No, no, no.
It's Pep-Pay.  Okay?

233
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:16,592
Oh, let me guess.
Arnold.  Right?

234
00:15:16,592 --> 00:15:18,495
No.  Bernie.

235
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:21,508
Oh... Well, Bernie, now that
we understand each other,

236
00:15:21,508 --> 00:15:24,297
I think you went a little
O.D.'d with that blush there.

237
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:29,349
Oh, so now the nanny's an expert.
/ I used to be a model.

238
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:32,340
And what happened?
You shrinked in the dryer?

239
00:15:33,548 --> 00:15:35,286
Putz.

240
00:15:37,261 --> 00:15:43,039
Oh my God, you turned out just perfect.
I wish I could just sign you.

241
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:49,755
Maggie, you look gorgeous.
/ Doesn't she?

242
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,220
Oh, Chloe,
I just love my outfit.

243
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,750
Oh, I'm sure, darling.  It's a
twenty-five hundred dollar Gautier.

244
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,837
Oh, I hope you got the receipt.
Eighty-nine-ninety-five at Loehmans.

245
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:05,120
Oh, knock 'em dead, Mags.
You look gorgeous.

246
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:09,502
Hello, Maggie.  This is Carlo.

247
00:16:10,286 --> 00:16:11,713
You like?

248
00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:18,758
Okay, darling, make love
to the camera.

249
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:22,435
Hey, wa-la!  That's it.
That's beautiful.

250
00:16:22,435 --> 00:16:27,201
Yes.  I am such a turn-on.

251
00:16:29,177 --> 00:16:33,853
Now dance for me! Dance!
Dance!  Yes!

252
00:16:33,853 --> 00:16:37,127
Wait, Carlo.  She's only fifteen.

253
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:40,643
Who is giving me a wedgie
I don't like so much?

254
00:16:42,611 --> 00:16:46,146
I'm her nanny.
Plus I used to model.

255
00:16:46,146 --> 00:16:48,502
What?  Feet?

256
00:16:51,323 --> 00:16:53,907
Euro-trash.

257
00:16:53,907 --> 00:16:58,467
Maggie, you rest.
We reload the camera.  Okay?

258
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:02,322
Carlo, what do you think?

259
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:05,394
Oh, how do you say...

260
00:17:05,394 --> 00:17:07,592
She stink.

261
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:11,577
Take a few more rolls, would you?
I mean, just make a fuss.
You know what to do.

262
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:15,545
I'm an artist.  You think I just
point the camera and take a picture?

263
00:17:15,545 --> 00:17:18,367
If you want to get paid.

264
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:21,805
Maggie, love to love you, baby.

265
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:32,812
Oh yes, I'll probably have to go off
to Milan for the fall fashion shows...

266
00:17:32,812 --> 00:17:36,871
School?  Oh, Chloe says
I might have to get a tutor.

267
00:17:36,871 --> 00:17:41,093
Yeah, 'cause you know I'll probably
have a lot of location shoots....

268
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,882
Oh, Chloe is so cool.

269
00:17:45,706 --> 00:17:48,839
No, she's not a phony at all!

270
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:52,211
Rotten one.

271
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:56,969
Okay.  Ciao, darling.  Yeah,
I'll talk to you later.

272
00:17:56,969 --> 00:17:58,687
Fran, do you know yoga?

273
00:17:58,687 --> 00:18:01,454
The bear?  Oh, that's Yogi.

274
00:18:01,983 --> 00:18:05,848
'Cause Chloe says it's the best
way to keep your energy up.

275
00:18:05,848 --> 00:18:11,244
Oh.  Um, listen, Mags, aren't you getting
just like a little ahead of yourself.

276
00:18:11,244 --> 00:18:12,823
What do you mean?

277
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:16,330
Well, I mean, shouldn't we just wait
and see how the pictures come out first

278
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,860
before we start planning big trips
to Milan and everything?

279
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,168
Well, Chloe says that I'm...
/ Yeah, I know what Chloe says.

280
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:25,391
But can't we just cross that
bitch when we get to it?

281
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,011
Excuse me?

282
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:32,102
That's an expression.
Bridge, crossing it.

283
00:18:32,102 --> 00:18:36,420
I'm only saying that not every beautiful
girl has to be a model.

284
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:42,255
I mean, you could be a gorgeous astronaut.
A, a leggy lawyer.  Grape?

285
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,953
You know what I think?
/ What?

286
00:18:43,953 --> 00:18:46,461
I think you're jealous.
/ What?

287
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:49,368
Because I'm living out
my dreams and you're not!

288
00:18:49,368 --> 00:18:51,755
Oh, Maggie...

289
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:56,361
It's all right, Niles, I'll get it.
It's probably Chloe.

290
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:59,138
Don't trip over your
hormones, sir.

291
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:04,654
Niles, I'm perfectly
in control of my hormones.

292
00:19:04,654 --> 00:19:07,974
Chloe, let me take
your dress, uh, coat.

293
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:10,468
Oh, smooth operator, sir.

294
00:19:10,468 --> 00:19:12,543
I'll be with you
in a minute, darling.

295
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:18,358
Me jealous of that fake?  That phony?
That... Oh honey, hi.

296
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:22,050
Hello, Fern.  Darling, I've got
the photographs.  Let's sit down.

297
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,834
Oh, how did they turn out?
/ Not good.

298
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:26,692
Well, see here...
/ Oh...

299
00:19:26,692 --> 00:19:31,220
You were just a little bit stiff,
and the eyes are just a little bit dead.

300
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,185
So what are you saying?
/ Oh, what am I trying to say?

301
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:39,659
That you're vacant, lifeless...

302
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:42,004
I stink?
/ Bingo!

303
00:19:43,122 --> 00:19:48,400
I just can't believe this.
/ Oh, she's so sensitive.

304
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:53,413
I can't believe I used
to idolize you.

305
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:57,641
You are the most insensitive,
self-centered woman I've ever met.

306
00:19:57,641 --> 00:20:02,058
Oh, you've got great feet.
/ You think? You know I used to...

307
00:20:02,058 --> 00:20:04,672
Whoa, what am I doing?
You're sucking me in again.

308
00:20:04,672 --> 00:20:08,088
Get back.  A woman needs
garlic around you.

309
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:11,368
Love to stay and chat,
but I've got a plane to catch.

310
00:20:11,368 --> 00:20:14,406
A plane?  Where are you going?
/ Paris.

311
00:20:14,406 --> 00:20:17,766
You're supposed to be going to
Southampton with Mister Sheffield.

312
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:20,910
Oh, dash it all, I completely forgot.
I should have put that in my book.

313
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:26,206
Yeah, well, he's counting on you.
/ Oh, nonsense.  He knows me better than that.

314
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:29,607
Twenty years ago I left him a total
wreck.  I can't believe he forgave me.

315
00:20:29,607 --> 00:20:33,684
I would never have forgiven me.
Oh, perhaps I would.  I am endearing.

316
00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:36,567
Oh, if I didn't just
get my nails done.

317
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:40,093
But you know this time
I should say goodbye.

318
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:44,239
I have grown.  Where is Maxwell?
/ No.  No, no, no, no, no, no.

319
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:47,343
No? / With your light touch,
I'll tell him.

320
00:20:47,343 --> 00:20:49,882
Oh, what a dear.

321
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:53,558
Well have a nice trip.

322
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:54,916
Oh...

323
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,599
Well, you've still got it.

324
00:21:10,328 --> 00:21:12,322
You knew all along, didn't you?

325
00:21:12,322 --> 00:21:14,580
Oh, honey, don't listen
to that witch.

326
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,983
You have so much more
going for you.

327
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:22,530
Her whole life is about her beauty.
Is that what you want?  At her age?

328
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,286
Jetsetting around the world going
from party to party,

329
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,990
one gorgeous man after the other.

330
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,386
I mean, to me it's
not a bad life.

331
00:21:31,386 --> 00:21:34,196
Wait, I'm, I'm losing my whole
point here.  What...

332
00:21:34,196 --> 00:21:37,052
Oh, Fran, I'm so sorry for
what I said to you.

333
00:21:37,052 --> 00:21:39,531
Sweetie, you weren't so far off.

334
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,840
I was jealous.
But not of you.  Never.

335
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,318
I just thought that you liked
Chloe better than me.

336
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:49,272
Fran, no way.
You're my best friend.

337
00:21:49,272 --> 00:21:52,610
Oh, really?  I don't know,
maybe I overreacted.

338
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,157
I'm just not used to rejection.

339
00:21:55,157 --> 00:21:59,602
It's hard. / Yes, I know,
angel, and I'm sorry.

340
00:21:59,602 --> 00:22:01,668
Well, I hope I've packed enough.

341
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:03,791
I wonder what the weather's
like in the Hamptons?

342
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,774
Very cold.

343
00:22:07,096 --> 00:22:09,514
Margaret, sweetheart,
what's the matter?

344
00:22:09,514 --> 00:22:11,803
Oh, the pictures stink.
I stink.

345
00:22:11,803 --> 00:22:14,273
Oh, I'm sure they don't stink...

346
00:22:17,246 --> 00:22:21,153
Well, pictures don't matter,
sweetheart.

347
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:23,706
If you want the world to see
how beautiful you are,

348
00:22:23,706 --> 00:22:27,595
you only have to step out into
it, and they'll see.

349
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:30,054
And if they're really lucky,
like me,

350
00:22:30,054 --> 00:22:34,239
they'll get to see how lovely
you are on the inside, too.

351
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:37,846
Oh, Daddy...
/ Oh, Mister Sheffield...

352
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:43,280
Oh, I've had a lot of disappointments
in my life, but I haven't let them stop me.

353
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,049
It's made me stronger.
/ I'll be all right.

354
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:55,365
Oh, I can't stand
to see her heart broken.

355
00:22:55,365 --> 00:22:58,120
Maybe I'll have a word with Chloe
when we get to Southampton.

356
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,840
Uh, Mister Sheffield, maybe
you ought to have a seat,

357
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,477
because in a couple of minutes,
oy, are you gonna be strong.

358
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:17,882
Make-up.

359
00:23:17,882 --> 00:23:20,851
Not too much, Pepe,
they'll look cheap.

360
00:23:20,851 --> 00:23:25,042
Now happy feet.
Yes, now sad feet.

361
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:27,605
Oh, your feet,
they have such soul.

362
00:23:27,605 --> 00:23:30,821
Now sexy feet.  Sexy...
Oh, yes, I like.

363
00:23:30,821 --> 00:23:34,187
Not that angle.
They don't wanna look fat.
