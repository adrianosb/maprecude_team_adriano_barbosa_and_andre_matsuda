1
00:00:04,517 --> 00:00:07,887
Now listen, Gwen, Mister Fluffy 
would like to share.

2
00:00:07,887 --> 00:00:10,733
Oh, I just love playing
 with dolls.

3
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:12,805
We're not playing. 
/ Oh?

4
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:15,000
We're in group therapy.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,682
Oh, thank God, because you know, 
I heard Ken and Barbie are on the skids.

6
00:00:22,682 --> 00:00:24,009
Really?

7
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:26,872
I heard it directly
 from Chatty Cathy.

8
00:00:26,872 --> 00:00:35,821
It seems Ken found out that Barbie
 had a fling with G.I. Joe right
 before Desert Storm.

9
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:38,464
Poor Ken. / Poor Barbie.

10
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:44,082
One little indiscretion in thirty
 years and it cost her the dream house.

11
00:00:44,082 --> 00:00:47,804
Barbie never said a word.  
She must be in denial.

12
00:00:47,804 --> 00:00:52,238
Sure.  Look at her feet.  
That's all from frustration.

13
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,565
Never trust a woman 
who can't wear flats.

14
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,034
All right!  All right!  I confess.  
Just make her stop playing! 
 It's torture!

15
00:02:04,403 --> 00:02:08,348
You don't know what torture is.  
My sister played the zephyr.

16
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:11,849
Once my ears actually bled.

17
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:17,660
My teacher says I have nimble fingers. 
/ You know, sign language is an excellent hobby.

18
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,252
Come on, Imogene, king me.

19
00:02:20,252 --> 00:02:22,651
Who's she talking to? / No one.

20
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:27,764
Okay, I'll do it myself.

21
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:33,597
Submit this for your approval.
 A girl, who has a friend,
 who isn't there.

22
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:38,156
An imaginary friend, 
here in the Gracie Zone.

23
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,494
Give her a break. 
 She's only six.

24
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:45,570
When she invites an imaginary guy 
to the prom, we'll start worrying.

25
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,987
I win.  You wanna play
 hide-and-go-seek?

26
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:52,083
Okay, you hide.

27
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,540
Where'd she go?

28
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,118
She is good.

29
00:02:57,915 --> 00:02:59,810
Gracie?  Yoo-hoo?  Honey?

30
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,640
Maybe we should all play
 a game together now.

31
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,818
You know, like Go Fish. 
 Or my favorite, Old Maid.

32
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,929
Exactly... 
/ Shut-up, Brighton.

33
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,744
Oops.  A bit too much polish.

34
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:23,300
Excuse me, is this
 Doctor Voort's office?

35
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,378
Oh, yeah.  Of course.

36
00:03:27,378 --> 00:03:32,240
I'm sorry.  I'm just a little
 new at this whole therapy thing.

37
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:34,302
May I help you?

38
00:03:34,302 --> 00:03:37,988
Well, what's that supposed to mean?
  I'm okay, you're okay.

39
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:42,180
Are they okay?

40
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:45,765
You must be a new patient. 
/ Me?  A patient?

41
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:48,693
What, are you nuts?

42
00:03:48,693 --> 00:03:51,867
Not that there's 
anything wrong with it.

43
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:54,642
I'm just here to
 pick-up Grace Sheffield.

44
00:03:54,642 --> 00:03:56,206
You must be the new nanny.

45
00:03:56,206 --> 00:04:00,816
Yes, Fran Fine.  I'm sort of
 a role model for her.

46
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:02,648
I'm sure she's mentioned me.

47
00:04:02,648 --> 00:04:05,702
Anything Grace may have said about
 you is strictly confidential.

48
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:07,221
Well, what do you mean?

49
00:04:07,221 --> 00:04:12,210
Oh, if she blabbed about that little
 Chutes and Ladders incident, I did not cheat.

50
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,621
She just can't count.

51
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:17,833
Please sit down.  You're
 disturbing the other patients.

52
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,750
Like they're not 
disturbed already.

53
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:29,955
Alligator handbag, two thousand bucks.  
Ha!  We should all have her problems.

54
00:04:31,307 --> 00:04:33,880
Hi ya, Gracie. 
 How was your session?

55
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,591
It was great.  I'm starting 
to make real progress.

56
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:39,461
Good for you. 
/ Come on, Imogene,

57
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:44,857
let's try...(Unintelligible) 
I was gonna say the same thing.

58
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:49,280
That's after a hundred 
and fifty dollar session.

59
00:04:56,605 --> 00:05:00,716
Well, what can one say 
about these costumes?

60
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:03,536
They're, they're awfully
 well drawn.

61
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:07,454
You stayed almost completely 
inside the lines.

62
00:05:08,414 --> 00:05:12,928
They're grotesque.  You couldn't design
 a dingy, you talentless hack!

63
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:15,600
He hung up on me.

64
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:21,257
You catch a lot more flies 
with honey than you do with vinegar.

65
00:05:21,257 --> 00:05:24,226
Although what anybody would want
 with a whole bunch of flies.

66
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:29,810
Unless, of course, you had a lizard
 to feed or a salamander or something.

67
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,999
Miss Fine, may I ask why you're 
in my office babbling about reptiles?

68
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:38,270
Well, actually, I wanted to talk 
to you about one of the kids.

69
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:43,137
Oh.  And if this is about canceling
 Maggie's piano lessons, God, yes.

70
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:46,562
So she's not Liberace. 
 Is that such a crime?

71
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:50,481
Yes.  In some countries 
they'd cut off her hands...

72
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,936
What?

73
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:58,817
Question: When they 
shot Bambi's mother,

74
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:02,143
did you find that a sad moment?...

75
00:06:08,085 --> 00:06:10,268
At all?

76
00:06:14,064 --> 00:06:19,360
I'm sure she's mounted on a nice
 wall in a fine home somewhere.

77
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:21,891
Ah-ha...

78
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:25,362
Well, now I'll talk to you.

79
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:29,449
Yeah, um, I took Gracie 
out to lunch

80
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:32,407
and that figment of her
 imagination tagged along.

81
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:34,071
Ah, Imogene.

82
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:38,569
Well, not that I mind eating two BLT's,
 but she stuck me for the check.

83
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:41,270
Yes.  She has been cropping up
 quite a bit lately.

84
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,064
Oh, you should have seen 
poor Gracie in the park,

85
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:47,420
sitting on the teeter-totter
 with her little tush in the dirt,

86
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,070
not budging an inch, just
 waiting and waiting.

87
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,583
I'll tell you, 
it broke my heart.

88
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,101
Well, perhaps we should
 increase her therapy.

89
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:58,881
Well, I was thinking of doing 
just the opposite.

90
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:00,899
I mean, she's six years old.

91
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:05,188
Does she really have to lie on some 
couch getting her head shrunk twice a week?

92
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:09,422
Miss Fine, they don't actually 
shrink the child's head.

93
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:11,909
What am I, an ignoramus?

94
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:17,117
Who recommended 
this quack anyway?

95
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,190
She happens to be one of the finest 
therapists in New York.

96
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:27,024
You can't even get in to see her 
unless one of her patients commits suicide.

97
00:07:27,024 --> 00:07:28,408
Oh.

98
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:31,435
That's just like my pedicurist, 
Thelma.

99
00:07:31,435 --> 00:07:36,216
Boy, that woman knows her way around 
a hammer toe like nobody's business.

100
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:38,522
Miss Fine, while I appreciate
 your concern,

101
00:07:38,522 --> 00:07:43,228
Gracie's a very complex child and therapy
 is an important outlet for her.

102
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:45,862
Well, look, if she needs an outlet
 I'll take her to Jersey.

103
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:49,704
They got a Ralph Lauren outlet,
 a Donna Karan outlet.

104
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:53,351
I'm not saying the kid's
 gotta go cold turkey.

105
00:07:53,351 --> 00:07:57,465
I'm just saying I think she needs 
a little less Freud and a little more fun.

106
00:07:57,465 --> 00:08:00,366
Therapy happens 
to be very beneficial.

107
00:08:00,366 --> 00:08:03,636
I've been going 
for twenty years.

108
00:08:07,676 --> 00:08:10,652
Nah.  Too easy.

109
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,636
How come they call them 
Toll House cookies?

110
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:24,839
Because you eat now
 and you pay later.

111
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,869
Don't eat raw dough, 
it'll make you sick.

112
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:29,687
Oh, that's not true. 
 Grown-ups just say that. / Why?

113
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:32,854
More dough for them.
 / Grown-ups lie sometimes.

114
00:08:32,854 --> 00:08:36,838
You know, you don't really have to wait
 an hour before you go into the pool.

115
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:41,466
Oh, unless you've eaten my mother's
 cooking, then you gotta wait a week.

116
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:45,191
No, Imogene's sitting there. 
/ Oh, whoops, I'm sorry.

117
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,035
I'll sit here. 
/ No.  Now she's sitting there.

118
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:51,468
Oh, she's a zippy little
 thing, isn't she?

119
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:55,112
Excuse me?... Oh, sure. 
/ What?

120
00:08:55,112 --> 00:08:59,049
She wants to sit on the counter. 
/ What are you doing?  She's only this big.

121
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:02,182
She's only this big and she's 
causing me this much trouble?

122
00:09:02,182 --> 00:09:04,570
Here, get in the tea cup.

123
00:09:05,475 --> 00:09:09,351
She's bored. 
/ She's bored?  Oh, here...

124
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:15,054
She just went 
to Disneyland.

125
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:18,403
Hi, Daddy. 
/ Hello, sweetheart.

126
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:22,033
Oh, don't eat raw dough, 
it'll make you sick. / Yeah, right.

127
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:27,197
The eggs are pasteurized.  
Here, live it up.  Take a finger full.

128
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:30,017
Mmm... Very tasty.
 / You know it.

129
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:33,919
So what did you ladies do today? 
/ We shopped till we dropped.

130
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,099
We tried on every pair of shoes
 and didn't buy a thing.

131
00:09:37,099 --> 00:09:41,654
I made a salesman cry.

132
00:09:41,654 --> 00:09:44,246
I'll tell you, 
she's got a real gift.

133
00:09:44,246 --> 00:09:47,655
Well, I have to say, Miss Fine, cutting 
down on her therapy seems to have done some good.

134
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:49,375
Well, you know what they say.

135
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,725
Who needs Freud when
 you've got Taragamo?

136
00:09:53,045 --> 00:09:55,449
The man should put 
out a shingle. / Stop!

137
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:57,152
What?  What?  What is it? 
/ What's the matter?

138
00:09:57,152 --> 00:09:59,657
You killed Imogene!
 / How?  What did I do?!

139
00:09:59,657 --> 00:10:02,440
You ate her! 
/ You ate her?

140
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,525
I did not eat her. / She was
 sitting on the cookie and you ate her!

141
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:08,968
Oh, come on, phooey. 
 There.

142
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:12,396
Oh, great, great.  She's got her
 out. There she is, Imogene's fine.

143
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:16,353
Yeah.  She's not dead.  She's just
 a little stunned.  You okay, honey?

144
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:19,797
Help her! 
/ Do something!

145
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:24,654
Well, what should I do?  CPR? 
/ CPR, CPR, right.  Over here.

146
00:10:25,018 --> 00:10:29,490
Well, I've only done it on a dummy. 
 I hope I know... What am I saying?

147
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,245
Daddy, hurry!
  She's getting cold!

148
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:34,727
All right, all right, the first thing
 we have to do is clear the air passageway.

149
00:10:34,727 --> 00:10:39,211
There.  Her throat's clear.
 / That wasn't her throat.  Ew...

150
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,513
All right, you'll wash your 
hands later.  Keep going.

151
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:48,366
All right now, now I have to breathe 
in her mouth.  This is her mouth?

152
00:10:50,308 --> 00:10:55,428
I'll pump her little heart. 
/ Don't break her, don't break her neck.

153
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:58,863
She's not breathing!
 / Oy, okay.

154
00:10:59,646 --> 00:11:01,435
Clear...

155
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:11,518
You take her pulse. 
/ Oh, oh.  Yes, right.

156
00:11:11,518 --> 00:11:14,301
Come on, I'm getting a pulse. 
 Oh look, she's coming around.

157
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:17,845
Well, she's a bit disheveled,
 but she's a plucky one.

158
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,841
She's come through! 
/ We've done it!

159
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:26,418
It's too late. 
 She's gone.

160
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:33,561
This is terrible. / I'll say.  
My malpractice insurance is gonna skyrocket.

161
00:11:33,561 --> 00:11:37,562
I can't believe this. 
/ Well it was an accident.

162
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,814
I'm telling you,
 I didn't eat anyone.

163
00:11:42,814 --> 00:11:45,091
A hair.

164
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:57,990
If I told her once, I told her 
a thousand times, don't sit on food.

165
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:03,375
Oh, angel, I'm so sorry. 
 I didn't mean to eat her.

166
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:09,248
The house is so empty without her.  
What am I gonna do with all of her stuff?

167
00:12:09,248 --> 00:12:13,496
Maybe we could call 
the Salvation Army.

168
00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:17,445
Oh, I'm sure they'll have 
room in the truck.

169
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:21,952
I keep expecting her 
to walk through that door.

170
00:12:21,952 --> 00:12:23,656
Well, you know, sweetheart,

171
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:28,954
since she was an imaginary friend, 
couldn't you just imagine she was alive again?

172
00:12:28,954 --> 00:12:31,913
If only it were that simple.

173
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:36,023
Well, she's not God, 
you know.

174
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:38,562
If you don't mind,
 I'd like to be alone.

175
00:12:38,562 --> 00:12:41,512
Of course, angel. 
 Well, we understand.

176
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:45,164
You just call us
 if you need anything.  Okay?

177
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,327
Oy...

178
00:12:52,776 --> 00:12:56,273
Do we have our hands full, Mister. 
/ I just don't know what to do for her.

179
00:12:56,273 --> 00:12:59,107
This, this whole imaginary friend thing 
has gotten completely out of hand.

180
00:12:59,107 --> 00:13:01,331
Well, you called the shrink. 
 What did she say?

181
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:04,558
Oh, I couldn't reach her.  
She's seeing her therapist.

182
00:13:04,558 --> 00:13:09,107
The therapist is in therapy? 
 No comment.

183
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:12,192
Poor little Gracie,
 she's taking this all so hard.

184
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,306
God, there must be something
 we could do.

185
00:13:14,306 --> 00:13:17,759
I remember when Goldie died. 
 May she rest in peace.

186
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,843
Your grandmother?
 / No.  My goldfish.

187
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:24,648
Goldie the goldfish.  Clever. 
 You should write.

188
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:29,452
I loved her so, and then there she was,
 one day, belly up in her bowl.

189
00:13:29,452 --> 00:13:33,354
Her little body 
just covered with ick.

190
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,787
We gave her a twenty-one 
flush salute.

191
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:39,966
A lovely tribute.
 / No.

192
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:43,120
She just wouldn't go down.

193
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,296
Miss Fine, I understand 
you're fond of your fish,

194
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:48,971
but are we floating anywhere
 near a point here?

195
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:53,835
The point is, and by the way, 
thank you so much for your sympathy,

196
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:56,621
is that when death comes
 tapping at your tank,

197
00:13:56,621 --> 00:14:01,781
you need to have some kind 
of closure.  Like a funeral.

198
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:04,198
Oh, so let me get this straight.

199
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:07,954
We're gonna have a mock funeral
 for an imaginary friend? / Yeah.

200
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:10,479
And Grace is the one in therapy?

201
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:19,511
Now when you give the eulogy, 
make sure you mention how much
 Imogene loved peanut butter.

202
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:22,492
Why do I have to do the eulogy? 
 Why not you?

203
00:14:22,492 --> 00:14:26,361
Well, wouldn't that be in poor 
taste?  I ate her.

204
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:29,438
Good point, Nanny Letcher.

205
00:14:29,438 --> 00:14:32,826
Hey, behave, or I'll take 
a bite out of you...

206
00:14:40,702 --> 00:14:42,824
Grace dear, 
how are you holding up?

207
00:14:42,824 --> 00:14:48,016
It's still a shock. 
 I always thought I'd go first.

208
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:52,349
I see you went with the
 open casket. But, um,

209
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:58,263
wouldn't Imogene rest more comfortably
 without my expensive new boots in there?

210
00:14:58,263 --> 00:15:03,194
No.  She always wanted to be
 buried with her boots on.

211
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:06,440
But they're my boots!

212
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,746
Lord and Taylor giveth and Lord 
and Taylor taketh away.

213
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:15,231
She couldn't have gone with
 a nice casket from Kinney's?

214
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:20,614
Grace, I know you miss Imogene,
 but remember, part of her will 
always be with you.

215
00:15:20,614 --> 00:15:23,856
And the rest of her's
 in Fran's stomach.

216
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:27,176
Unless she's already 
been passed on.

217
00:15:28,998 --> 00:15:33,521
Okay.  Your father has a few words
 to say about the dearly departed.

218
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:39,279
Um, oh yes, well, what can
 one say about Imogene?

219
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,189
Faithful friend,
 constant companion,

220
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:45,664
peanut butter lover.

221
00:15:45,664 --> 00:15:49,297
Now, Niles.
 / Oh, I'm too overcome, sir.

222
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:52,201
I have a few words prepared.
 / No!

223
00:15:53,628 --> 00:15:57,251
Well, perhaps we can take some 
solace from the immortal words,

224
00:15:57,251 --> 00:16:01,206
'Therefore, ask not for 
whom the bell tolls...'

225
00:16:01,206 --> 00:16:03,248
Thank God it tolled for me.

226
00:16:03,248 --> 00:16:05,926
That's Doctor Voort. 
 I'll take it in the office.

227
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:08,104
Oh, Maggie, play something. 
/ Really?

228
00:16:08,104 --> 00:16:11,635
Any requests?
 / Gee, how about 'Heart and Soul'?

229
00:16:11,635 --> 00:16:13,144
Okay.

230
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:20,699
As if there isn't enough
 pain in this house.

231
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:24,434
Ah yes, Doctor,
 it's Grace.

232
00:16:24,434 --> 00:16:29,940
No, well, she's okay, but I'm 
afraid Imogene has been better.

233
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,394
She's dead.

234
00:16:32,394 --> 00:16:36,036
Eaten, actually.
 By the nanny.

235
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:39,650
I spit her out. 
 She died on the table.

236
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,598
All right, all right. 
 Thank you, Doctor Voort.

237
00:16:42,598 --> 00:16:44,069
She wants to see 
us immediately.

238
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,975
Us?  Oy, shrinks.

239
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:49,686
They always blame 
it on the nanny.

240
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,580
Hi, Gracie.  Doctor Voort 
is waiting for you.

241
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,717
We're late.  Can't you ever 
be on time for anything?

242
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:05,530
You think this look 
happens by accident?

243
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,332
You think these clothes
 just fall on me?

244
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:12,582
The only shoes that work with 
this outfit are six feet under.

245
00:17:14,997 --> 00:17:18,730
That's how we used to talk to 
each other.  Remember, sweetheart?

246
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,518
Yes, dear.

247
00:17:20,518 --> 00:17:24,730
But then Doctor Voort gave us 
the tools to rebuild our marriage.

248
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,861
And now it's perfect.

249
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:32,142
We're not married.
 / Get out now!

250
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,922
You know what the doctor's
 gonna do, don't you?

251
00:17:40,922 --> 00:17:43,720
She's gonna try and pin this
 whole thing on me.

252
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,866
And she'd be wrong exactly how?

253
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:50,420
Well, I'm not like the one that 
cut back on Gracie's therapy.

254
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:55,089
You're the one who suggested it. 
/ Since when do you listen to me?

255
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:57,708
Oh, he walked right
 into that one.

256
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:01,991
Besides, I never would have suggested 
it if I knew then what I know now.

257
00:18:01,991 --> 00:18:04,380
What do you know? / Oh, you know.

258
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:10,128
Niles told me all about your family tree.
  It's just crawling with mahsuganers.

259
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:14,562
Translation?
 / Nuts.  Kooks.  Whackos.

260
00:18:14,562 --> 00:18:17,755
My family's demeanor is
 a vicious rumor. / Hm-hmm.

261
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:21,749
Just 'cause my Great Aunt Herminie
 lived in the gazebo with 
a giant hoot owl.

262
00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:25,246
There's the Queen of Normal.

263
00:18:25,246 --> 00:18:29,958
Not to mention your Uncle 
Duncan with the magic kilt.

264
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,418
It was magic!

265
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,668
Gracie darling,
 how are you feeling?

266
00:18:35,668 --> 00:18:40,515
I'm drained.  I don't bounce
 back like I used to.

267
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,789
Have a seat, Gracie.

268
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:46,941
Hello, Mister Sheffield.
 And you must be the nanny.

269
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:49,522
Is that what she told you?
 / You are the nanny.

270
00:18:49,522 --> 00:18:51,695
Oh, right.

271
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,495
'Get out?'  Is that
 what you want?  Out?

272
00:18:57,495 --> 00:19:01,956
Yes, I want out. 
/ Forget it.  You're in.  Forever!

273
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:04,291
Okay.

274
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:10,550
I'm sure it's been
 a difficult time for everyone.

275
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,671
Would you like a cookie?

276
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,467
I think not.

277
00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:25,211
Look, before you start blaming 
me for everything, I just
 wanted you to know

278
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:28,250
that I've always had Gracie's
 best interest at heart.

279
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,651
And I think I've done 
a pretty good job with her,

280
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:34,356
except for this one measly 
little dead friend thing.

281
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:37,427
You know what I think? 
/ That's it?

282
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,722
Two seconds of conversation and 
you're ready to pass judgment?

283
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:43,685
I think you've done 
a good job with Grace.

284
00:19:43,685 --> 00:19:46,627
Oh, she is very insightful.

285
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:53,155
She's really starting to open up. 
 Not to mention a marked 
improvement in her wardrobe.

286
00:19:53,155 --> 00:19:55,912
Oh, thank you.

287
00:19:57,054 --> 00:19:58,968
We'll talk.

288
00:19:58,968 --> 00:20:02,472
Lujean, would you please
 send Grace in?

289
00:20:02,472 --> 00:20:06,425
You know, Grace first started 
seeing me after her mother died.

290
00:20:06,425 --> 00:20:08,924
Which is about the time
 Imogene first appeared.

291
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:11,765
To help fill the void
 in Gracie's life.

292
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:14,257
Ah, I think I see what
 you're getting at, Doctor.

293
00:20:14,257 --> 00:20:18,414
Well, will somebody
 buy me a vowel?

294
00:20:19,368 --> 00:20:23,482
Hello, sweetheart. 
/ Hi, angel, come sit between us.

295
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:29,742
You know, Grace, Fran's feeling 
really bad about what happened to Imogene.

296
00:20:29,742 --> 00:20:31,954
Well, sure.  
She killed her.

297
00:20:33,043 --> 00:20:35,923
Well, she didn't really 
kill her, did she?

298
00:20:35,923 --> 00:20:38,975
Yeah, I was there.
  She ate her.

299
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:41,472
I tried to save her.

300
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:47,815
Now, Grace, I want you to think. 
 Was it really Fran's fault?

301
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:51,558
You mean, 'cause Imogene 
was just my pretend friend?

302
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:55,814
That's right.  And maybe you just 
didn't want to play with her anymore.

303
00:20:55,814 --> 00:20:59,635
Yeah.  She was kind of 
getting on my nerves.

304
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:05,841
Now what's the real reason 
you don't need Imogene anymore?

305
00:21:05,841 --> 00:21:08,352
'Cause now I have Fran.

306
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:14,519
I'm speechless.
 / This is a miracle.

307
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:17,738
No, it's really a common 
psychological occurrence.

308
00:21:17,738 --> 00:21:20,951
No.  The miracle is 
her being speechless.

309
00:21:24,487 --> 00:21:28,578
I feel much better now.
 / Me, too.

310
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,937
Maybe this whole therapy
 thing isn't such a crock.

311
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:34,329
Well, thank you, Miss Fine.

312
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:37,505
Here, Fran, you want a cookie?

313
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:41,168
Oh, I don't think so. 
/ It's all right, Fran.

314
00:21:41,168 --> 00:21:42,472
Go ahead.

315
00:21:42,472 --> 00:21:47,962
Hmm... You sure you don't
 see anybody sitting on this?

316
00:21:47,962 --> 00:21:51,372
No.  Do you?

317
00:21:58,686 --> 00:22:01,182
Miss Fine, it's three 
o'clock in the morning.

318
00:22:01,182 --> 00:22:03,288
Thank you, Big Ben.

319
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,231
Lose something?

320
00:22:06,231 --> 00:22:09,213
No.  I've always wanted 
to visit China.

321
00:22:09,213 --> 00:22:10,829
Give it up, Miss Fine.

322
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:14,750
You'd be singing a different tune 
if your wing tips were pushing up daisies.

323
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,187
Let the poor souls 
rest in peace.

324
00:22:18,727 --> 00:22:22,087
I can't.  I'm still 
making payments on them.

325
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:23,494
Oh, here.

326
00:22:24,692 --> 00:22:27,564
Oh, Niles, you doll you.

327
00:22:27,564 --> 00:22:31,579
Well, I just figured if we dig a deep 
enough hole we can bury the piano.
