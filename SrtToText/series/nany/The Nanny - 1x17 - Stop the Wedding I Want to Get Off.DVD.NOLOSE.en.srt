1
00:00:04,452 --> 00:00:06,910
Yeah, I love you, too. 
 And I miss you terribly.

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,474
Who's he talking to? 
/ What's it worth to you?

3
00:00:10,474 --> 00:00:14,168
It's my sister from London.
 / I didn't know Maxwell had a sister.

4
00:00:14,168 --> 00:00:17,608
Well, now we know what
 you're worth to him.

5
00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:20,063
All right, I'll see you then,
 Jocelyn.  Goodbye.

6
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:24,961
Oh, was that your sister? 
 Oh, I hope you said hi for me.

7
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:27,116
Why does Miss Fine
 know about it?

8
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:30,008
He talks in his sleep.

9
00:00:31,386 --> 00:00:35,536
Is everything all right, sir?
 / Yes.  Jocelyn's coming for a visit.

10
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,024
And she's bringing a man.

11
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:41,693
Oh, what a great hostess gift. 
 Gee, I hope she knows my size.

12
00:00:41,693 --> 00:00:46,085
Are you sure you heard her correctly, sir?
  She's not bringing a ham?

13
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:48,735
No, I distinctly heard a man.
 / Astounding.

14
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:53,525
Unbelievable. / Boy, this poor girl
 must be the hound of the Baskervilles.

15
00:00:53,758 --> 00:00:57,455
No, on the contrary, Miss Fine, 
Jocelyn's very attractive and terribly effusive.

16
00:00:57,455 --> 00:01:00,610
A good roll-on could 
take care of that.

17
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,255
It's just that Miss Jocelyn has never
 brought someone home to meet the family.

18
00:01:04,255 --> 00:01:07,574
Yeah, she's never gotten serious 
about any particular gentleman.

19
00:01:07,574 --> 00:01:12,293
Oh, I got you.  Yeah, that's just
 like my cousin Gladys.

20
00:01:12,293 --> 00:01:16,332
But you know, she's very happy. 
 And if you ever need your radiator flushed,

21
00:01:16,332 --> 00:01:18,645
she's your man.

22
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,388
Oh, Niles, I wanna make a good impression
 on Mister Sheffield's sister.

23
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:13,626
You think this outfit is okay?

24
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:16,411
Oh, perhaps something 
a bit more conservative?

25
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:20,093
You haven't even looked yet.
 / All right, I looked.

26
00:02:20,934 --> 00:02:24,127
Oh, it's all right, Niles. 
 That'll be Jocelyn. I'll get it.

27
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:28,014
Puddle Duck.
 / Mopsey.

28
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:30,499
Got you last.

29
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:34,947
Joce, haven't we grown 
out of these childish games?

30
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,494
Ah, made you flinch.

31
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,211
Puddle Duck?  Mopsey?

32
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:43,333
Why, Miss Fine, didn't you
 have a nickname for your sister?

33
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,771
Yeah.  Moron.

34
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:50,623
Hi.  Fran Fine.  I'm the nanny.
 / Oh, lovely to meet you.

35
00:02:50,623 --> 00:02:54,271
And I'd like you all to meet Nigel
 Waters, the Duke of Salisbury.

36
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:57,678
Oh, I love your steaks.

37
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:01,451
Thank you.

38
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:06,307
Lord Worcheshire and I get together
 every Sunday for a barbecue.

39
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:10,291
And the Earl of Sandwich pops
 by for leftovers.

40
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:15,561
Oh, I never got Benny Hill either.

41
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:18,828
Oh, thank you, Lester.  
You remember Lester, don't you, Maxie?

42
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:22,456
Sorry, no. / Oh, sir, he's been
 her chauffeur for twenty years.

43
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:24,270
Oh, don't blame yourself, sir.

44
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,925
You've probably only ever 
seen the back of my head.

45
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:30,050
Oh, Lester!  Yes, of course!  
Oh, good to see you again, old man.

46
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,257
Thank you, sir.

47
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:34,274
So, you're a duke. 
 Have you got a brother?

48
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:39,702
Maxwell, you described her laugh 
all wrong in your letters.

49
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:43,753
It's nothing like the Q.E.
 Two adrift in a fog.

50
00:03:45,046 --> 00:03:48,288
Mister Sheffield, you've
 been writing about me?

51
00:03:48,288 --> 00:03:51,314
Yes, well ....  So, uh, how was 
your flight? / Marvelous.

52
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:55,412
We even had a massage on the plane.
 / Oh, wow, some plane.

53
00:03:55,412 --> 00:04:00,610
The last supersaver I took, I didn't 
need a brassiere.  I had my knees.

54
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:04,884
Let's just pop some food in there,
 shall we?

55
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:07,851
So this is wonderful.
  How long have you two known each other?

56
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:10,582
Yes.  Was it love at first sight? 
/ Yes.

57
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:15,597
The moment I laid eyes on her, 
I thought, my god, she's suitable.

58
00:04:15,817 --> 00:04:20,808
**** And the moment I saw him, 
I thought, he seems nice.

59
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,920
Oh, dash it all, darling.  
You want to tell them or shall I?

60
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,792
We're engaged. 
/ You go ahead.

61
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:31,061
Oh, that's wonderful. 
/ Oh, oh ....

62
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:35,703
Oh, this is so exciting.
 I gotta call my mother.

63
00:04:35,703 --> 00:04:39,873
We have never had a duke in the 
family before.  Well, we did once,

64
00:04:39,873 --> 00:04:42,554
but we had to have
 him put to sleep.

65
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:54,154
This is so scrummy, Niles. / Yes, I remembered 
steak and kidney pie was your favorite.

66
00:04:54,154 --> 00:04:56,519
And you all complained 
about my mother's cooking?

67
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:00,063
At least she steered clear 
of the urinary tract.

68
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:07,007
So, did you and Uncle Nigel
 have fun on the boat?

69
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:10,600
What boat, darling? / Fran said 
you hooked a really big fish.

70
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,122
Oh, eat up.

71
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:16,484
Maxwell, your children are charming.

72
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:20,291
Oh, dear, we forgot to buy them
 presents.  Well, let me give you money.

73
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,248
Oh, Nigel, that's not necessary.
 / Are you sure?  I have lots.

74
00:05:23,248 --> 00:05:26,559
I wouldn't miss it at all.
 / Quite sure.

75
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:30,317
Excuse me, Dad, but I believe 
he was talking to us.

76
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:34,235
Brighton, don't be greedy.  
God'll punish you.

77
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:37,879
Good evening, everyone. 
/ See?

78
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,572
Jocelyn, Nigel, I'd like you to meet
 my business partner, Miss C.C. Babcock.

79
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:45,275
Hello. Actually, I'm more 
like part of the family.

80
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:49,664
Yes, we keep putting her out at night,
 and she keeps finding her way back.

81
00:05:51,556 --> 00:05:54,856
So, have you two set a date?
 / Oh, who's had time?

82
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:58,267
I'm still exhausted from
 our month in Tahiti.

83
00:05:58,267 --> 00:06:02,433
Oh, you know, you really ought to set
 a date if you want to book a catering hall.

84
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:07,362
And if you want an accordion, oh, 
you're really gonna have to move fast.

85
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,902
Fran was a bridal consultant 
at Danny's Parisian Brides for Less.

86
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:14,898
Maggie, please.
  Head bridal consultant.

87
00:06:14,898 --> 00:06:17,515
Say, why don't you two have
 the wedding right here?

88
00:06:17,515 --> 00:06:21,948
I could throw you an affair that's
 to die for.  I kept their rolodex.

89
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:25,065
Miss Fine, that's a splendid idea.

90
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:28,594
I can just see the wedding pictures now.  
The Duke and Duchess of Salisbury

91
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:32,107
at opposite ends of a ten foot hero.

92
00:06:37,027 --> 00:06:39,618
Darling, are we free this Sunday?

93
00:06:39,618 --> 00:06:41,979
No, we're, we're golfing
 with the Worthingtons.

94
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:46,475
Oh, pooh.  I hate the Worthingtons.  
I don't much care for golf.

95
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:49,354
Then let's get married.  
It's a perfect excuse.

96
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:51,728
Okay.  But let's keep it simple.

97
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:56,287
Smart.  I always say, put 
the money towards the castle.

98
00:06:56,665 --> 00:07:00,696
Then it's settled.  We'll get married 
this Sunday.  Pass the salt.

99
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:03,312
I'm so happy for both of you.

100
00:07:03,312 --> 00:07:07,583
Oh, mazel tov.  That's pip, 
pip in Yiddish.

101
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:14,243
Meanwhile, Niles, this is one recipe 
that you can pull from your repertoire.

102
00:07:14,243 --> 00:07:18,251
Oh, as it happens, steak and kidney pie 
is also Lady Diana's favorite.

103
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:21,539
Oh, and they wonder why 
she's always throwing up.

104
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:31,080
Gracie, sweetheart, 
what's the matter?

105
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,861
I can't be a flower girl.  
It's too much pressure.

106
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,643
What if Aunt Jocelyn slips on my petals 
and falls and breaks her leg?

107
00:07:39,643 --> 00:07:42,902
Then we'd have to shoot
 her like my pony.

108
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:48,536
Oh, sweetie, why don't you go upstairs 
and take a nice, hot, relaxing bath.

109
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:51,315
Put in some of that aroma
 therapy I bought you.

110
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:55,005
The sage?
 / No, I think that's for P.M.S.

111
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:57,121
Try the lavender.

112
00:07:57,614 --> 00:07:59,566
I'll get it.

113
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:01,812
Oh, finally.

114
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:03,064
Hi. 
/ Hey.

115
00:08:03,064 --> 00:08:05,948
Wow. 
/ Nice place, huh?

116
00:08:05,948 --> 00:08:08,780
Where's Ellie May and Jethro?

117
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,993
I don't know how I'm gonna top it unless 
I get a job working for Seigfried and Roy.

118
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,293
Something tells me they're not 
gonna be needing a nanny.

119
00:08:16,545 --> 00:08:19,072
Here's the stuff I brought you
 from the bridal shop. / Oh.

120
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:20,753
See ya. / Well, what's your rush?

121
00:08:20,753 --> 00:08:24,384
I thought you were gonna help me
 with the wedding plans so that 
you can hang out with Maggie.

122
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:27,809
Oh, I was.  But after seeing how she lives, 
I realize I'm not in her league.

123
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:30,443
Oh, don't be thrown 
by all these trappings.

124
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,082
This is just an average,
 ordinary house.

125
00:08:33,082 --> 00:08:37,335
Oh, excuse me, I just gotta ask
 the butler something.  Have you seen the Duke?

126
00:08:37,335 --> 00:08:40,637
Oh, he and Mister Sheffield 
have gone yacht shopping.

127
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:45,287
Smart.  Avoid the Christmas rush. 
/ Sweetie, don't be intimidated.

128
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:49,581
I'm telling you, Maggie is just
 a normal down-to-earth girl.

129
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:51,015
Oh, hi, ho. 
/ Hi.

130
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:52,627
Gotta go.

131
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:55,698
Hi, Kenny.
 / Bye, Maggie.

132
00:08:55,698 --> 00:09:00,791
Where's he going? / I think the leather
 boots probably scared him off. 
 It's a Jewish thing.

133
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:05,715
Jocelyn, come on, I want you to see what
 I just had brought over from the bridal shop.

134
00:09:05,715 --> 00:09:09,963
It's a genuine copy of a knock off 
of an Ives Saint Laurent.

135
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:13,286
It kind of screams, "I'm getting 
married," don't you think?

136
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,423
Well, honey, you're marrying a Duke.

137
00:09:15,423 --> 00:09:18,222
If it were me, I would be throwing 
leaflets out of the Goodyear blimp.

138
00:09:18,222 --> 00:09:22,123
And my mother would be flying it.

139
00:09:22,123 --> 00:09:25,986
Come on, I need some information from you 
and the betrothed about the wedding.

140
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:29,609
Now, what's your favorite song? 
/ I don't believe we have one.

141
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:33,014
Oh, come on, you gotta have one. 
 Evergreen?

142
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:34,764
Close To You?

143
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:38,050
Not even Duke of Earl? / No.

144
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:42,798
What's your favorite song? 
/ Well, I'm partial to You Better Shop Around.

145
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:47,003
But that would be more 
appropriate for a shower.

146
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,258
Maybe we should just flip a coin.

147
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:54,978
Gee, no offense, but you're really pretty 
blase about this whole event.

148
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:57,113
You love the Duke, right?

149
00:09:57,113 --> 00:10:00,281
Who wouldn't? 
 He's solid and dependable.

150
00:10:00,281 --> 00:10:04,194
And best of all, his mother's dead.

151
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:11,285
Enough said.  Well, we still gotta deal
 with the matchbooks, the napkins,
 the seating charts, the yamukas.

152
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:15,918
Oh, yeah, well, that should take some of the pressure off.

153
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:20,354
I think I'll leave the little details
 to you.  I'm going to go for a drive.

154
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,499
Lester?
 / Yes, miss?

155
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,481
What took you so long?

156
00:10:25,481 --> 00:10:27,877
Would you like to go ... 
/ ... go to the park, miss.

157
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,944
You read my mind. / Oh, well,
 then maybe you can tell me.

158
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:34,682
What's her favorite flower?
  Her favorite color?  What she likes to drink?

159
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:38,306
Roses, peach, perianguline.

160
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:39,671
Oh, well ....

161
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:42,921
He's better than Dionne Warwick.

162
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:52,423
Oh, I'm telling you, Niles, I got 
a strange vibe from this whole marriage.

163
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:54,824
Bridal consultant's intuition?

164
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:57,779
The last time I did a wedding 
with this level of excitement

165
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:01,615
involved my cleaning girl
 and a green card.

166
00:11:02,154 --> 00:11:05,825
And even she requested 
Quanton Amera.

167
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:09,763
Oh, mark my words, Jocelyn
 don't love the Duke.

168
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:12,928
Oh, British women are not known 
for displaying their passion.

169
00:11:12,928 --> 00:11:15,395
Believe me, I've been there.

170
00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:20,189
Niles, I'm telling you, be it
 Great Britain or Great Neck,

171
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:23,958
women in love are all the same. 
 When I was engaged to Danny ....

172
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,866
Hmm .... 
/ All right, pre-engaged.

173
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:31,546
I knew his favorite song, his favorite
 food, his favorite back wax.

174
00:11:32,394 --> 00:11:36,552
I didn't miss a thing.  Except
 that little affair with Heather Biblow.

175
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:40,241
Well, now you know
 his favorite hobby.

176
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:42,563
Don't start with me, Niles.

177
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:45,151
I'm telling you, when a woman
 is in love with a man,

178
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:48,640
she should be swept off her feet.

179
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:53,960
Oh, hello there.  Oh, I took a bit of a spill.  
You can put me down now, Lester.  I'm fine.

180
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,721
No, miss, I insist on taking
 you up to your room.

181
00:11:56,721 --> 00:11:59,896
Oh, he spoils me so.

182
00:12:04,461 --> 00:12:07,281
Well, I got the song.

183
00:12:07,281 --> 00:12:10,334
Baby You Could Drive My Car.

184
00:12:17,242 --> 00:12:18,651
Mister Sheffield?

185
00:12:19,574 --> 00:12:22,063
Mister Sheffield, are you up?

186
00:12:22,063 --> 00:12:24,272
Mister Sheffield, it's me.

187
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:29,822
What is it?
 / You couldn't sleep either, huh?

188
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:34,310
Miss Fine .... / Oh, look, I never
 pictured you in pajamas like that.

189
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,417
Not that I pictured you without pajamas,
 although I could.  I've seen you naked.

190
00:12:37,417 --> 00:12:39,970
Should I start again?

191
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,611
No, let's forge ahead, shall we?

192
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:46,171
I think you should call off the wedding
 'cause your sister doesn't love the Duke.

193
00:12:46,171 --> 00:12:48,959
She's in love with her chauffeur.

194
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,402
Jocelyn and Lester? 
/ Hm-hmm.

195
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:53,616
Oh, my god! 
 When did she tell you this?

196
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:57,765
Oh, she has no idea. 
 Only you know and I know.

197
00:12:57,765 --> 00:13:00,153
Even he don't know.

198
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,501
Let me get this straight. 
 My sister should not marry the Duke

199
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:06,287
because she's in love 
with the chauffeur. / Right.

200
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:08,480
But she doesn't know it.
 / Nope.

201
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,574
Oh, well, then by all means,
 let's convince her.

202
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:14,143
Come on, let's, 
let's wake up the whole house.

203
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:19,046
We'll insist that she dump the Duke and 
all he has to offer, 
and run off with her penniless driver.

204
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:21,958
Oh, I knew you'd understand!

205
00:13:23,084 --> 00:13:25,800
Right.  We can talk about 
it in the morning.

206
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:34,720
Shrimp, baby lobster tails,
 and cracked crab.

207
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,574
Yeah.  If we were serving this 
in Flushing, we'd need a police barricade.

208
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:44,025
By the way, sharp outfit. / Oh, thanks. 
 Sonny Bono was having a yard sale.

209
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:47,951
Funny. / Think so.  Maybe
 I'll do it in my stand-up act.

210
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:50,751
You know, that would be a good 
thing to invite Maggie to.

211
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:54,778
Somehow I can't picture Maggie 
in the Half Shell Room at Benny's Clam Bar.

212
00:13:54,778 --> 00:14:00,664
Oh, don't be so hard on yourself.
  Just because she's rich doesn't 
mean she can't fall for a schlep like you.

213
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,769
Gee, thanks.

214
00:14:03,355 --> 00:14:07,455
Okay, who ate half
 the tush off the cupid?

215
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:09,323
Gracie.

216
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,402
Not me.  I'm too nervous to eat.

217
00:14:13,748 --> 00:14:16,569
She's very sensitive. 
 She senses doom.

218
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:20,283
Miss Fine, Grace senses 
doom at Disneyland.

219
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:24,055
Look, my sister has finally found the person 
she wants to settle down with,

220
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:27,914
and I am not about to ruin her
 wedding day because you have a hunch.

221
00:14:27,914 --> 00:14:30,487
Oh, you're probably right. 
 I mean,

222
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:35,276
if your sister was really in love
 with the chauffeur, she would
 have told him years ago.

223
00:14:35,276 --> 00:14:38,507
Oh, no, no, no, don't try that
 reverse psychology on me.

224
00:14:38,507 --> 00:14:41,524
No, I'm agreeing with you.  
Passion, smassion.

225
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:45,082
I've been reading too many books
 with Fabio on the cover.

226
00:14:45,365 --> 00:14:47,578
So you're not going to interfere?

227
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:52,864
Look, if you're asking me if I'm gonna bang
 on the church doors and scream "Elaine!",

228
00:14:52,864 --> 00:14:54,505
no.

229
00:14:55,404 --> 00:14:56,710
Good.

230
00:14:59,863 --> 00:15:06,206
Oh, would you just trust me? I promise
 you I am not going to say a word to Jocelyn.

231
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:08,159
Lester!

232
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,398
Yes, Miss Fine?

233
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:12,766
Les, I know that we haven't really
 spoken much, but I was thinking,

234
00:15:12,766 --> 00:15:16,086
why haven't you told Jocelyn
 that you're in love with her!?

235
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:18,507
What!?  I beg your pardon!

236
00:15:18,507 --> 00:15:21,588
You know, seize the day,
 car bay deon.

237
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,761
You speak Latin? 
/ Well, pig.

238
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:32,311
Are my feelings that obvious? 
/ Well, to a trained eye.

239
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:35,278
I could never presume to tell
 her such a thing.

240
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:40,131
Miss Jocelyn is beyond my reach. 
 She's back seat, I'm front seat.

241
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:42,845
You know, if you ever bothered
 to look in your rearview mirror,

242
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:46,671
you would see that she's in love
 with you, too. / You sure?

243
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:50,526
Yes.  She loves you,
 you love her ....

244
00:15:50,526 --> 00:15:54,044
Oh, boy, I've been watching 
too much Barney.

245
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:57,491
Oh, Miss Jocelyn and me ....

246
00:15:57,491 --> 00:16:00,448
It's just a fantasy.

247
00:16:00,448 --> 00:16:03,490
You see, I have nothing to offer.

248
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,968
Except your undying love.

249
00:16:05,968 --> 00:16:10,973
Ah, well, if only
 that were enough.

250
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:19,270
Mmm ....  All this 
shrimp is fabulous.

251
00:16:25,956 --> 00:16:28,995
I don't know why, I just love weddings.

252
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:32,443
Yeah, we all want what 
we can't have.

253
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:36,811
Maxwell, do you think
 you'll ever get married again?

254
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:41,905
I hope so.  Oh, I love my children,
 but it does get a little lonely at times.

255
00:16:41,905 --> 00:16:46,194
Poor baby, you know 
I'm always there for you.

256
00:16:46,194 --> 00:16:49,408
Making lazy circles in the sky.

257
00:16:52,852 --> 00:16:54,300
Lester ....

258
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,823
Oh ....

259
00:16:55,823 --> 00:16:58,187
You look like an angel, miss.

260
00:16:58,187 --> 00:17:00,016
Well, what are you doing here?

261
00:17:00,016 --> 00:17:03,686
Well, actually, miss, 
I've come to say goodbye.

262
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,045
You're leaving me? / Yes.

263
00:17:07,045 --> 00:17:11,200
Well, you'll be living with the Duke 
and he's got his own staff.

264
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,307
But of course you'll 
be coming with me.

265
00:17:13,307 --> 00:17:16,041
You'll love your new room. 
 It has a view of the moat.

266
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,392
You can barely hear the drawbridge.

267
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:23,467
Thank you, miss, but I'd rather not.

268
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:24,759
Well,

269
00:17:26,098 --> 00:17:29,020
best of luck.
 / Thank you ....

270
00:17:34,195 --> 00:17:37,308
May I kiss your hand, miss? 
/ Please.

271
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:42,729
I've been very happy in my work.

272
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:48,107
You'll be awfully 
hard to replace.

273
00:17:48,421 --> 00:17:52,324
I wish I could have done
 more for you, miss.

274
00:17:53,165 --> 00:17:56,328
You're off to a jolly good start.

275
00:17:57,626 --> 00:18:00,037
You look good, kid. 
 You look tough.  You feel okay?

276
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,629
Yeah, yeah.
 / All right.

277
00:18:02,629 --> 00:18:07,035
Go on out there and splatter 
those petals all over the floor....

278
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,363
Where is she?

279
00:18:16,214 --> 00:18:17,631
... Oy ....

280
00:18:20,271 --> 00:18:22,561
Miss Fine, where's Jocelyn? 
 It's time to give her away.

281
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:25,189
Too late. She's already gone.

282
00:18:29,323 --> 00:18:30,921
My God, what did you do!?

283
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:33,465
Well, I didn't say anything to her.

284
00:18:33,465 --> 00:18:36,811
Did you speak to Lester? 
/ Oh, I talked to a million people today.

285
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:40,022
You think I remember every Tom,
 Dick and Harry?

286
00:18:41,278 --> 00:18:45,832
Um, ladies and gentlemen, we're 
experiencing a little technical difficulties,

287
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:49,399
so, uh, for your prenuptial enjoyment,

288
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:52,676
the comic stylings of 
Mister Kenny Keroucas.

289
00:18:52,676 --> 00:18:54,143
Huh?

290
00:18:56,532 --> 00:18:59,907
So how many of you have
 been Bar Mitzvahed?

291
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:05,566
What's happened?
 / Oh, Nigel ....

292
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:07,635
Jocelyn, is she all right? 
/ Don't go in there.

293
00:19:07,635 --> 00:19:11,516
Why not? / It's bad luck to see 
the bride before the wedding.

294
00:19:14,795 --> 00:19:17,036
I'll say.

295
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:24,561
Oh, Nigel, I'm terribly sorry.
 / I'm sorry, sir, but we're in love.

296
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:27,838
Yes, I see that.  Thank you.

297
00:19:29,388 --> 00:19:31,767
Wow, he's taking it well.

298
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:34,197
Can't you see I'm heartbroken?

299
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:38,388
Really, Miss Fine, how insensitive.

300
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:41,030
Oh, well, how are you supposed to
 know what you British are feeling?

301
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,685
What do you all wear, mood rings?

302
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:47,242
Nigel, please say
 you'll forgive me.

303
00:19:47,242 --> 00:19:50,818
Well, it won't be easy, Joce.
  We did have a bit of fun together.

304
00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:54,298
Granted, not as much fun as 
you've had with the chauffeur.

305
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:58,779
I shall bow out gracefully 
with my head held high.

306
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:02,456
You know, you could sneak out 
that way. / Better yet.

307
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:06,856
All the best.
 / Ta-ta.

308
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:13,781
Puddle Duck, are you awfully 
disappointed in me?

309
00:20:13,781 --> 00:20:17,120
Oh, of course not, Mopsey.

310
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,027
I'm just sorry you didn't find happiness 
with Lester twenty years ago.

311
00:20:21,027 --> 00:20:25,440
Who knew you could find true love
 in the back seat of a car?

312
00:20:27,544 --> 00:20:30,948
Anyone that's still living 
at home with their parents.

313
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:38,047
I've been thinking, seems a shame 
to waste all that food.

314
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,924
Oh, Lester, the answer's yes.

315
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:43,301
Yes, yes, yes.

316
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:44,995
Oh ....

317
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:51,329
Well, next time I get a hunch, 
I say we go to the track.

318
00:20:53,838 --> 00:20:55,930
I remember what my dad told me. 
 He said, "Kenny,

319
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,756
it doesn't matter what religion you are,
 or what the color of your skin is.

320
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:03,425
There'll always be people out there 
who aren't gonna like you, 
'cause you're irritating."

321
00:21:04,776 --> 00:21:10,988
Oh, thank you, Kenny Kerocuas.
  Ladies and gentlemen.

322
00:21:10,988 --> 00:21:12,200
Kenny, you were great.

323
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,351
I'll be doing my whole act 
at Benny's Clam Bar this weekend

324
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:18,675
Maybe you wanna go? 
/ I'd love to.

325
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:22,744
Really?  I just lost 
all respect for you.

326
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:27,415
Well, as they say,
 the show must go on.

327
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:31,119
So, all those on the bride's side,
 please remain seated.

328
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,845
All those on the groom's side can 
pick up their gifts on the way out.

329
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:35,828
Hit it ....

330
00:21:50,854 --> 00:21:54,857
Oh, I just love weddings. 
/ Yes, me, too.

331
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:58,224
Oh, Niles, such 
a display for a Brit.

332
00:21:58,224 --> 00:22:00,895
Well, I'm part French.

333
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,950
Miss Fine, you left
 the bouquet out there.

334
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,921
C.C. almost ran off with it. 
Great catch, by the way.

335
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:20,395
Hey, I've been a bridesmaid so many times,
 I could out-jump the Shack.

336
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:23,509
It was a beautiful wedding, 
Miss Fine. / Hm-hmm.

337
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:28,074
I think Lester and Jocelyn really 
looked happy. / Yes, they did.

338
00:22:28,074 --> 00:22:31,008
And to think they almost missed
 their chance. / Oh, I know.

339
00:22:31,008 --> 00:22:37,215
In this day and age to have two people
 rule out love just because of class.

340
00:22:37,215 --> 00:22:42,269
Imagine, being blind to the fact that 
you love someone just because they work for you.

341
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:45,060
I know.  It's unbelievable.

342
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,722
Yes, well, goodnight, Miss Fine.

343
00:22:47,722 --> 00:22:49,536
Goodnight, Mister Sheffield.

344
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:11,551
Smart.  Put the money 
towards a castle.

345
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:13,884
That's not the line.

346
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:17,792
I got it, Morris.  
I always, I say, I say.

347
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:21,604
I always say, save up 
for a house.  Sorry.

348
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:27,208
It is contagious. 
/ Oh, no, I'm so sorry, audience.



9999
