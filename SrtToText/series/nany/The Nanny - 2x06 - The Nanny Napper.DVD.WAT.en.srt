1
00:00:09,057 --> 00:00:12,287
Okay, kids, come one, come on. 
 Everyone hold on to me.

2
00:00:12,287 --> 00:00:15,935
Not you, you pervert.

3
00:00:16,188 --> 00:00:19,463
Wow!  This is so cool.  
Dad never let's us take the subway.

4
00:00:19,463 --> 00:00:21,668
Well, the entire city is in gridlock.

5
00:00:21,668 --> 00:00:24,425
I don't know who schedules 
a gay pride parade on the same day

6
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:27,798
they're unveiling
 a Calvin Klein billboard.

7
00:00:28,065 --> 00:00:29,291
Give me a dollar!

8
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,090
Don't worry, kids,
 I'll take care of this.

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,047
What am I, Santa Claus?
  You give me a dollar!

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,971
Yeah!

11
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,950
You weren't even afraid of him.

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,140
Oh, honey, just cause 
he yelled in my face?

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,002
You obviously have never seen 
my mother watch "The Price is Right."

14
00:00:50,836 --> 00:00:53,016
Oh, it's creepy down here.

15
00:00:53,016 --> 00:00:55,400
Oh, honey, the subway's not creepy.

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,075
It's just that nobody 
gives a damn anymore.

17
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:01,579
What do I do with my soda?
 / Just leave it on the floor.

18
00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:07,597
Oh, would you look at that poor woman
 with all those kids and bags.

19
00:01:07,597 --> 00:01:09,267
Hold your sister a minute.

20
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:11,652
Excuse me.  Can I give you a hand?

21
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,642
Can I hold something for you?

22
00:01:19,642 --> 00:01:23,319
Oh, wow.  I would have
 given me the salami,

23
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:26,844
but you're a lot cuter.

24
00:01:26,844 --> 00:01:32,852
You see, kids, one simple act of kindness
 and already the world is a better place.

25
00:01:33,824 --> 00:01:37,091
Of course this is America, 
she could speak English.

26
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:43,896
Hi, you're sweet.  
Oh, good, a seat.

27
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:49,567
Yes, you're such a doll; 
you're such a doll.

28
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:54,005
That's right, shaupaneua.

29
00:02:03,563 --> 00:02:06,145
Oh, what a shaupaneua,

30
00:02:06,145 --> 00:02:09,303
what a little bubbula.

31
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:11,645
Excuse me, Yentel.

32
00:02:12,378 --> 00:02:13,874
Yeah?  What?

33
00:02:13,874 --> 00:02:15,650
Where's the mother?

34
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,722
Oh, my God. 
 She abandoned her baby.

35
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,902
Ah, what is 
this world coming to.

36
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:26,078
The salami she guards
 with her life.

37
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:27,890
What are we going to did?

38
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,258
Oh, you poor defenseless
 little thing.  Ow!

39
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:35,118
Someone's hungry.

40
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:39,443
Can you believe that wasn't the first time 
that ever happened to me in the subway.

41
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:31,541
Oh, I can't believe
 I'm holding a baby.

42
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:35,136
If only you came with a husband 
and a house in Great Neck.

43
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:39,339
Okay, we gotta act fast here.  
Gracie, go bring down your pink blanket.

44
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:40,872
Not my blankie.

45
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:43,357
Oh, God, I can't believe 
you still have that thing.

46
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:46,107
And, Brighten, bring down
 the Snoopy up in your closet.

47
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:48,202
What Snoopy up in my closet?

48
00:03:48,202 --> 00:03:49,635
You know, you're 
just like my mother.

49
00:03:49,635 --> 00:03:53,336
What Nestles Crunch bar 
under my Nordic Track? Go ...

50
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,326
Oh, what a day I had today.

51
00:03:57,326 --> 00:04:01,216
Oh, let me guess.  
Yard sale at Mia Farrow's?

52
00:04:01,604 --> 00:04:07,903
Maggie, go see 
if you can find some bottles.

53
00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:11,456
Niles, do we have any old nipples
 around the house?

54
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,997
Hello, hello

55
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:23,043
Good afternoon, Cee Cee, 
Niles, Miss Fine, baby.

56
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:24,725
Why?

57
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:27,693
Some woman just abandoned
 this baby on the subway.

58
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:29,543
I'll tell you it's 
a good thing I was there,

59
00:04:29,543 --> 00:04:31,930
or he could have been
 found by some whacko.

60
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,365
You know, one of those people who walk 
around talking to themselves.

61
00:04:35,365 --> 00:04:39,015
Although, what the hell I'm going 
to do with a baby, I'll never know.

62
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:40,738
I'll call 911.

63
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:45,903
What kind of evil, cold-hearted woman abandons
 a poor little defenseless creature?

64
00:04:45,903 --> 00:04:51,033
Oh, that reminds me.  Yellow cab called, 
you left your dog in the taxi again.

65
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:52,958
Oh, my God.

66
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:56,222
That's where
 I left my Gucci umbrella.

67
00:04:56,222 --> 00:04:59,946
Ten to one she comes back with 
a Gucci and not a poochie.

68
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:02,997
Hello, you've reached emergency 911.

69
00:05:02,997 --> 00:05:06,953
To report a murder, press 1, 
for mugging, press 2.

70
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:10,420
For bomb threats below
 34th Street, press 3;

71
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,746
34th Street to 72nd, press 4.

72
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,378
Oh, you gotta love the NYPD.

73
00:05:16,378 --> 00:05:21,738
Meanwhile, where's that David Carruso going 
so fast with that big white freckly butt of his?

74
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,334
Miss Fine, why the devil did 
you bring the baby here?

75
00:05:25,334 --> 00:05:28,056
Why didn't you just pass him over 
to a policeman straight-away?

76
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:30,187
They're very busy.  It's Sunday.

77
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:32,898
The gays are coming out; 
the yuppies are working out;

78
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:35,758
and the Jews are eating out.

79
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:41,593
Be careful. Mr. Snoopy's really old.

80
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:45,501
Look, his tail's loose; 
his hair's falling out,
 and he's busting at the seams.

81
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:48,934
Oh, give him a remote control.
  He could be my father.

82
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:52,191
Fran .../ Here, you hold. 
 What sweetie?  What?

83
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:55,454
Fran, I can't find
 my blankie anywhere.

84
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:00,653
Fran?

85
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:04,758
Yes, honey. / I can't find any bottles 
anywhere.  How about a turkey baster?

86
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:09,160
Oh, sweetie.  We're trying to feed 
a baby, not impregnate Ling-Ling.

87
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:10,697
Oh, all right, Miss Fine that's it.

88
00:06:10,697 --> 00:06:13,378
Here's your coat. We're going down 
to the police station.

89
00:06:13,378 --> 00:06:16,430
Oh, all right, but I'm telling you,
 we're never going to get through.

90
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,114
How many gay people can 
there be in New York?

91
00:06:19,114 --> 00:06:23,121
This from a man who
 produces Broadway musicals?

92
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:28,481
It's a bloody mob scene out there.

93
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:32,978
I mean, I'm proud I'm British. 
 But you won't see me marching 
around dressed as Queen Victoria.

94
00:06:34,036 --> 00:06:36,684
I told you we should have 
taken the subway.

95
00:06:36,684 --> 00:06:38,982
Why?  Hoping to pick up a few more?

96
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,363
Maybe start a bowling team?

97
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:44,729
Hey, a hundred sexy men
 wanted your phone number.

98
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:49,451
All they asked me was 
if my boots came in a Size 13.

99
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,611
The baby's back.
 / Oh, Daddy, can we keep him?

100
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:56,907
Gracie, he's not a lost puppy. 
 He's somebody's baby.

101
00:06:56,907 --> 00:07:00,021
All right.  Can I have a puppy?

102
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:01,992
No, you may not have a puppy.

103
00:07:01,992 --> 00:07:05,018
Well, I don't know. 
It might help fill the void

104
00:07:05,018 --> 00:07:08,631
after we have to give
 away our baby boy.

105
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:11,693
Miss Fine / We need another
 boy in this hen house.

106
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:14,871
There's far too much
 "Blossom" on the tube.

107
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:18,483
Here, Maggie, hold
 little Joshua Elliott.

108
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:20,084
Who?

109
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:25,111
Well, Elliott after your father,
 and Joshua I just always liked.

110
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:28,494
Oh, I can't wait to have 
a baby of my own.

111
00:07:28,494 --> 00:07:31,176
Yes, you can wait.

112
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,824
You can wait a lot.

113
00:07:34,824 --> 00:07:37,744
Can you say Nintendo?

114
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:40,200
Oh, he's so cute.

115
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:44,357
We can't give him up.
 / No.

116
00:07:44,357 --> 00:07:46,947
Euu, he's pooping. 
/ Oh, God.

117
00:07:46,947 --> 00:07:51,711
Oh, no, give him to Brighten. 
/ No, give him to Fran.  She's getting paid.

118
00:07:52,908 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, what are they making 
such a fuss about?

119
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,870
You'd think that they'd
 never ever seen a...

120
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:13,371
Oh ...  Oh, this kid's got far 
too many lentils in his diet.

121
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:16,204
Oh, for God's sake, 
just give him to me.

122
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:20,361
Come here, little fella.  Hoe ...

123
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,719
All right.  I know what I'm going to do. 
I'm going to call the Department of Social Services.

124
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:35,169
Oh, yeah, Sunday at 4:30, 
they're waiting for you.

125
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:38,807
Oh, there's that vein 
in your forehead again.

126
00:08:38,807 --> 00:08:40,081
You know, Miss Fine, it's very odd.

127
00:08:40,081 --> 00:08:42,399
But that vein wasn't there a year ago.

128
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,570
Just like the gray 
streak in your hair?

129
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,863
Yes, exactly like 
the bloody gray streak.

130
00:08:46,863 --> 00:08:51,011
Oh, now, would you calm down. 
 You're getting all wound up.

131
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:53,847
Pretty soon you're going to say
 something that you're going to regret.

132
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:56,454
I already did when I said,
 "You're hired."

133
00:08:56,454 --> 00:09:00,014
All right.  Fine.  I'll just dump 
the kid at the white zone at the airport.

134
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:03,905
There'll be 40 cops on top of him
 before he's done unloading.

135
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,471
Oh, Maxwell, I'm so glad you got
 that baby to the authorities.

136
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:11,812
I was very worried about 
that poor little defenseless thing.

137
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:17,438
Oh, slap that kid's picture on 
a milk carton, and let's get back to work.

138
00:09:24,862 --> 00:09:29,114
Oh, Joshy, what's the matter? 
 Why aren't you eating?

139
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,037
Oh, Niles, what the hell is this?

140
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:35,299
Pureed liver and Brussels sprouts.

141
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:40,216
Oh, the stuff that came out of him
 was more appetizing than that.

142
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:45,943
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, now don't get mad.

143
00:09:45,943 --> 00:09:50,322
I'm just giving him one last feeding before
 I have to take him to the orphanage.

144
00:09:50,322 --> 00:09:53,719
Can you say, "Please, sir, 
I want some more."

145
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,986
That's enough, Miss Fine.

146
00:09:55,986 --> 00:10:00,285
Well, what's with the box?  Are you planning 
on mailing him to the police station?

147
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:03,031
Because then you better punch 
some holes in the top.

148
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:05,989
As a matter of fact, these are 
some of Brighten's old baby clothes.

149
00:10:05,989 --> 00:10:07,766
I thought they might 
come in handy.

150
00:10:07,766 --> 00:10:10,383
Oh, that was very sweet of you.

151
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:15,539
Isn't he a nice man?  
Isn't he a good man?  Yes.

152
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:22,170
Miss Fine, I think you're becoming far 
too emotionally attached to this child.

153
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,776
Yes, isn't she, little fella.

154
00:10:24,776 --> 00:10:28,369
She, she is.  
I think she is.

155
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,720
I think she is. 
/ Well, you look very natural.

156
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,937
I've been there 
three times, Miss Fine.

157
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:38,245
And if my expertise serves me,
 I think we need changing again.  Excuse us.

158
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:39,860
Oh, give him to me. 
 I'll take him.

159
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,448
No, no, that's all right. 
 I've got him.  I'll do it.

160
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:43,604
All right.  Wait a minute here. 
/ Let's just lay him down there.

161
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:46,408
Lay him down. / Yeah, little fella.
  We're gonna change you.

162
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:50,388
Yeah, good boy, yeah, 
good boy, good boy.

163
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:52,478
Well, Miss Fine, 
I wouldn't stay there.

164
00:10:52,478 --> 00:10:54,591
You never know with little boys.

165
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,702
Brighten once shorted a wall clock.

166
00:10:59,816 --> 00:11:01,811
There we go.
 / Oh, yeah.

167
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:07,262
Well, we know one thing for sure. 
 His mother was not speaking Hebrew.

168
00:11:12,543 --> 00:11:17,492
They love it when you blow
 on their tummies. / Who doesn't?

169
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:20,040
Who's the handsome
 fella there, huh?

170
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,892
Yes, who's the handsome fella?  
You know he reminds me of Brighten.

171
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,312
Heads up.
 / Oh, exactly like Brighten.

172
00:11:28,757 --> 00:11:31,902
What did you do? 
 What did you do?

173
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:35,510
We'll get you dry.  Yes, we will. 
/ You're a good boy.

174
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:40,409
You know, Miss Fine, I apologize 
for blowing up at you earlier.

175
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:45,577
Well, Mr. Sheffield, I apologize for...
 actually, I didn't do anything.

176
00:11:45,577 --> 00:11:47,117
You're quite right.

177
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:49,476
Come here, little guy.  Come here.

178
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:53,633
Oh, oh, honey, would you
 I mean, Mr. Sheffield,

179
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:55,490
put the TV on.

180
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,669
They like the background noise.

181
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:00,070
Senator Doll said 
he hasn't read the bill,

182
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,011
but he's 100 percent against it.

183
00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:06,807
And in the local news, police
are looking for this woman

184
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:11,517
in connection with the mid-morning
 kidnapping on the subway.

185
00:12:11,517 --> 00:12:13,750
Oh, would you look at that nut.

186
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,802
And she's running around free.

187
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,400
Oh, my God, Miss Fine, that's you.

188
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,155
No way.

189
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:22,333
Suspect is said
 to be five foot, seven;

190
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,634
approximately 105 pounds, 
and in her early 20's.

191
00:12:25,634 --> 00:12:28,813
Oh, you're right.  It is me.

192
00:12:29,106 --> 00:12:30,612
Miss Fine ...

193
00:12:30,612 --> 00:12:32,526
Well, now, it's obviously a mistake.

194
00:12:32,526 --> 00:12:35,414
And it's all my problem. 
 It has nothing to do with you.

195
00:12:35,414 --> 00:12:37,853
Suspect is believed 
to work for this man,

196
00:12:37,853 --> 00:12:41,201
the Broadway producer 
Maxwell Sheffield.

197
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:43,408
All right, that's it.  
We're going down to the police station.

198
00:12:43,408 --> 00:12:48,420
Oh, can't we just call Al Cowlings 
and drive around for a while first?

199
00:13:04,837 --> 00:13:09,199
Oh, wow!  This looks just like
 the police station on Cagney and Lacey.

200
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,439
No wonder they had so much
 crime in that precinct.

201
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:16,256
All you had to do was 
out run Tyne Daily.

202
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,599
Mr. Sheffield, maybe you should
 take a number?

203
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:21,852
Miss Fine, this isn't a bakery. 
 They don't give you numbers.

204
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:24,392
Oh, all right.
 / 62.

205
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:26,761
Would you go get
 a number, please.

206
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:29,264
Men, what are you going
 to do with them?

207
00:13:29,264 --> 00:13:32,328
Well, I'm not going
 to shoot him next time.

208
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,837
Oh, little Jeremy Mathew,
 how are you?

209
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:42,649
What happened to Joshua Elliott?

210
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:45,048
I got tired of it.

211
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:47,086
I like the name Joshua.

212
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:48,857
63.

213
00:13:48,857 --> 00:13:52,130
Oh, that's us. Now may 
I do the talking, please.

214
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:57,481
Now, Mr. Sheffield.  I got us into this,
 let me.  Now, look, Dick / Sergeant.

215
00:13:57,481 --> 00:13:58,906
I'm sorry, Seargeant.

216
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:02,234
Dick Sergeant,
 what are the odds?

217
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,698
Miss Fine ...

218
00:14:04,698 --> 00:14:07,145
Oh, all right, you better 
talk to him.  I'm exhausted.

219
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:10,239
I've been taking care of 
a strange baby all day.

220
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:14,144
Sergeant, this woman,
 my nanny, Fran Fine,

221
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:17,082
is charged with a crime that 
I can assure you she didn't commit.

222
00:14:17,082 --> 00:14:18,569
Prostitution?

223
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:20,754
Excuse me.

224
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:22,828
I'm not a hooker.

225
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,572
I'm a kidnapper.

226
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:27,390
Well, my lawyer will 
finally get that house

227
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,054
in the south of France 
he's always wanted.

228
00:14:30,054 --> 00:14:33,270
Fran Fine, you're under arrest.

229
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:38,312
Oh, my God.  Mr. Sheffield, 
call Jacoby & Meyers.

230
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:42,606
I want the fat one, not the thin one. 
 He's got an attitude.

231
00:14:42,606 --> 00:14:45,369
Or is that Siskel and Ebert?

232
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:47,375
You have the right to remain silent.

233
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,381
Obviously you don't 
know her very well.

234
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:54,055
Shoes

235
00:14:59,204 --> 00:15:01,053
Hair

236
00:15:08,664 --> 00:15:10,667
Well, height is one thing,
 but if you think

237
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:13,086
that I'm going to set
 one foot on a scale,

238
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:17,292
you might as well just put me into
 a cell and throw away the key.

239
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:20,468
What next?  Because frankly
 I'm feeling very violated.

240
00:15:20,468 --> 00:15:24,634
We're going to have to
 strip search you.

241
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:28,066
Oh, no.  Not until there's
 a ring on this finger

242
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:31,397
and two tickets to Aruba.

243
00:15:32,151 --> 00:15:37,259
Oh ...  Well, I wouldn't
 want to obstruct justice.

244
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:55,206
Oh, sir 
/ Niles, what are you doing here?

245
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:59,310
Well, I was watching "America's 
Most Wanted" and low and behold ...

246
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,579
I brought you a fresh shirt and 
your shaving things. / Oh, thank you.

247
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,931
I don't plan on being 
here very long.

248
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:07,743
How on earth did you get here 
with that gay pride parade going on?

249
00:16:07,743 --> 00:16:11,523
Oh, I borrowed a poodle and walked.

250
00:16:11,523 --> 00:16:17,327
In fact, I got several job offers.  
What's the difference between 
a butler and a houseboy?

251
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:21,187
Well, in your case, 
about 30 years, Niles.

252
00:16:21,187 --> 00:16:23,684
Rot in jail, sir.

253
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:31,057
Well, there's one 
fantasy shot to hell.

254
00:16:42,976 --> 00:16:44,192
Niles ...

255
00:16:44,192 --> 00:16:48,892
Didn't you see me fall in that
 Con Ed ditch?  I nearly killed myself.

256
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:53,951
All I saw was a blond woman in 
an olive overcoat, and then she was gone.

257
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:56,737
Well, what am I wearing?

258
00:16:56,737 --> 00:16:59,809
Oh, looky there.

259
00:17:01,162 --> 00:17:03,844
Maxwell, is everything all right?

260
00:17:03,844 --> 00:17:07,059
Has she been incarcerated yet?
  Did I miss it?

261
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,056
Cee Cee, you could show 
some concern for Miss Fine.

262
00:17:10,056 --> 00:17:13,809
Maxwell, my concern is for you.

263
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:18,145
Before Nanny Fine entered our lives, 
we never had to step foot
 in a place like this.

264
00:17:18,145 --> 00:17:22,170
Cee Cee?  Girlfriend.

265
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,398
Got you again, huh?

266
00:17:25,398 --> 00:17:28,125
You must have me confused
 with someone else.

267
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,168
I've never seen 
this person before in my life.

268
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:33,198
Oh, is that your game,
 that's cool.

269
00:17:33,198 --> 00:17:37,927
Just stay off Second Avenue. 
 Leon's looking for you.

270
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,724
Maxwell, I swear.

271
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:45,296
Here you go.

272
00:17:51,116 --> 00:17:55,940
How'd you like it, sugar? / Oh, it was so good,
 I could do it again and again and again.

273
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:01,962
Maxwell, you can't seriously 
believe that... I know.

274
00:18:01,962 --> 00:18:05,530
Did you go to Brinmar?

275
00:18:08,198 --> 00:18:10,611
Miss Fine, 
what did they do to you?

276
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:12,688
Oh, it was horrible.

277
00:18:12,688 --> 00:18:16,407
Seven women, one toilet, no door.

278
00:18:16,407 --> 00:18:19,371
Here's Big Bertha doing her business
 right out there in the open

279
00:18:19,371 --> 00:18:23,177
like she's on "Wild Kingdom" 
or something.

280
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:31,056
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, I'm scared. 
 I can't go to prison.

281
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:34,662
I went to the bathroom maybe 
three times in all of summer camp.

282
00:18:34,662 --> 00:18:37,754
I can't hold it in
 for five to twenty.

283
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:39,339
You're going to have
 to come with me.

284
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:42,638
Oh, I can't believe
 this is happening.

285
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:44,982
I was just trying to be helpful.

286
00:18:44,982 --> 00:18:48,901
This is just like Nickie
 on the "Young and the Restless."

287
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:51,849
Young and Restless? / Yeah.

288
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:54,581
Nickie Newman.  (Inaudible.)
 / Yes, yes,

289
00:18:54,581 --> 00:18:58,692
remember Nickie was accused of stealing
 Cricket's baby at Gibo Cosmetics.

290
00:18:58,692 --> 00:19:00,409
Cricket's ...  (Inaudible.)

291
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,461
Only she wasn't stealing the baby.

292
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:06,479
She was looking or a woman
 that was putting on blush.

293
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:10,263
Mascara. / Oh, yeah,
 she's right, she's right.

294
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:15,077
And then Cricket thought that the baby
 was stolen and Nickie went to jail,

295
00:19:15,077 --> 00:19:20,267
and that shower scene was more 
than we should have seen on daytime.

296
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:22,826
Quiet, quiet.

297
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:25,826
It wasn't Cricket's baby.

298
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,329
It was Ashley and Snapper's.
 / Snapper.

299
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:35,322
All right.
  Considering the circumstances,

300
00:19:35,322 --> 00:19:37,546
I guess you're free to go, Miss Fine.

301
00:19:38,822 --> 00:19:41,994
Can I at least say
 good-bye to the baby?

302
00:19:42,174 --> 00:19:45,390
Just wave, Miss Fine. 
/ Oh ...  Bye, Joshy.

303
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:50,769
Oh, Cibignia. 
/ Cibignia.

304
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:55,875
Oh, that ought to go over
 big on the playgrounds.

305
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,039
Well, I only knew him 
for a couple of hours,

306
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:01,338
but I'll never forget him.

307
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:07,101
I'll never forget her either. 
 Quick, act like we're together.

308
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:23,266
You know what?  I sort of liked
 having a baby in the house,

309
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:26,820
except I had no idea 
how much work they were.

310
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,874
And they're always making a mess.

311
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:36,708
You know what, Niles, 
on second thought,

312
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,387
could you bring these upstairs
 so we can watch some TV? / Thanks.

313
00:20:39,387 --> 00:20:44,132
I have two words for you. 
 Hansel and Gretel.

314
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:46,655
Well, actually, 
that's three words.

315
00:20:55,655 --> 00:21:00,072
Oh, my, would you look
 at this mess.

316
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:03,654
I'm binging.  I'm a little depressed 
about giving back the baby.

317
00:21:03,654 --> 00:21:07,842
Oh, well, sweetie, we had to 
give him back.  He wasn't ours.

318
00:21:07,842 --> 00:21:10,409
That's right.  
He didn't belong to our family.

319
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:13,530
Then why don't
 you two make a baby?

320
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,158
Take it away, Mr. Sheffield.

321
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:20,860
Well, I mean, we'd have to be... 
well, you know, you have to be married first.

322
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,941
Oh, right, married. 
/ Has to be an engagement.

323
00:21:22,941 --> 00:21:26,009
I'd want a big ring,
 a party... don't ask.

324
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:29,624
Then why don't you two get married?

325
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:32,819
I did the last one.
 / Thanks.

326
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:36,239
Well, you have to be in love
 with the person.

327
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:39,971
Don't you love, Fran?
 / Yeah.  Don't you love Fran?

328
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,273
Well, in a nanny-Fran-boss
 type of way.

329
00:21:44,273 --> 00:21:49,615
Yeah.  And I love your father in 
a thanks-a-lot-you-British-cold-fish type of way.

330
00:21:49,615 --> 00:21:54,461
But you could have a baby and
 get married if you wanted to.

331
00:21:56,195 --> 00:22:00,201
Well, we'd have to be best friends
 to see if we can live together,

332
00:22:00,201 --> 00:22:03,672
and of course there'd have to be
 a very strong physical attraction...

333
00:22:03,672 --> 00:22:06,482
would you go to bed.  Geez.

334
00:22:07,374 --> 00:22:12,704
Kids, huh?  Always asking questions. 
/ And such vivid imaginations.

335
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:16,233
Why is the sky blue? 
 Where's heaven?

336
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:20,173
Why don't you and I have a baby?
 / Ha, ha, ha, ha.

337
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,576
Meanwhile, I wonder
 if I'll ever be a mother.

338
00:22:22,576 --> 00:22:25,579
Well, there's always 
the subway, Miss Fine.

339
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:27,511
Forget it.  Next time
 I bring home a baby,

340
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:30,348
it's going to be after nine months
 of swollen ankles and an epidural

341
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:34,064
that could bring down Secretariat.

342
00:22:54,797 --> 00:22:57,585
Please, no putting on makeup.

343
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:01,316
What are you going to do?  
Charge me with lipstick?

344
00:23:01,474 --> 00:23:05,692
Let's not play games. 
 Did you take the baby, Fran?

345
00:23:05,692 --> 00:23:09,711
Now, I'd have to be pretty
 stupid to take a baby

346
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:13,290
when I could have
 taken the salami,

347
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,060
and I'm not stupid ...

348
00:23:21,594 --> 00:23:25,335
Can I get a little eye contact here?

349
00:23:25,335 --> 00:23:31,072
Oh ...  You got a better chance of seeing 
Tania Harding on a box of Wheaties.
