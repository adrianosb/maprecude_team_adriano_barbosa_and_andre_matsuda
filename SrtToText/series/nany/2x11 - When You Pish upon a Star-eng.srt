1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,627
Maxwell, we can get this kid. His parents said yes.  His agent said yes.

2
00:00:07,627 --> 00:00:09,992
Now, shall I call Elaine and close the deal or not?

3
00:00:09,992 --> 00:00:14,554
I don't know, Cee Cee.  A sitcom star in a revival of "Oliver"?

4
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:18,902
What are we going to call it?  "Eight Orphans is Enough"?

5
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:22,721
Maxwell, this kid is on every lunch box in America.

6
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:25,508
This is little Kippy from "Royal Flush."

7
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:29,113
Never heard of it.  Niles? / Oh, I'm not much for sitcoms, sir.

8
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:33,034
Well, "Mr. Belvedere," "Benson,"

9
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:37,630
anything really where the butler is the smartest member of the family.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,991
Maxwell, I am telling you Jack Walker spells box office.

11
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:46,464
He will appeal to even the least-cultured, lowest common denominator.

12
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:50,617
Oh, you have got to try these pepperoni pockets.

13
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:55,803
You will never order from Pizza Hut again.  What?

14
00:00:55,803 --> 00:00:59,434
Miss Fine, have you by any chance heard of a young actor named Jack --

15
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:03,923
Walker from "Royal Flush"?  Oh, the kid is a genius.

16
00:01:03,923 --> 00:01:07,575
When he goes "Hey!  Yoe!  Whoa!"

17
00:01:09,218 --> 00:01:12,151
You see, Maxwell, if we've got Jack, we've got a success.

18
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:14,317
I will bet my reputation on it.

19
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:17,896
Oh, sorry, there's a $5.00 minimum.

20
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:20,297
Oh!

21
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:24,740
Look, he's walked off his show.  He wants to do quality,

22
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,097
and he thinks that's what we do.  Ha, ha.

23
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,193
All right.  I'll think about making him an offer.

24
00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:34,693
Yeah, well, don't give it as much thought as you did when you turned down "Cats."

25
00:01:34,693 --> 00:01:38,379
What is the bloody statute of limitations on that mistake, Miss Fine?

26
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:43,296
I would say now and forever.

27
00:01:43,296 --> 00:01:45,846
Have you ever even seen "Royal Flush"?

28
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:49,505
Oh, God, now she's sitting on the desk.  This is going to be an hour at least.

29
00:01:49,505 --> 00:01:53,237
I'll be brief.  See, it's all about this rich handsome widower

30
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:57,320
who hires this really streetwise maid to take care of his kids,

31
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,804
only she's really gorgeous so there's this major sexual tension.

32
00:02:02,804 --> 00:02:04,190
Oh, please. / What?

33
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,294
He's in love with his business partner.  She's got all the class.

34
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:13,080
Oh, what show are you watching?  The butler shuts her up every time she opens her mouth.

35
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,934
There's a butler?

36
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:17,731
All right.  Make the bloody deal.

37
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:20,522
Anything to put an end to this insipid discussion.

38
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:24,924
Oh, this is exciting.  So, you put him up at a really nice hotel,

39
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:29,242
give him the red carpet treatment, you know, room service, limos, theater tickets --

40
00:02:29,242 --> 00:02:34,427
oh, and, you know, just so that he shouldn't feel alone, I'll go with him and take care of him.

41
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:40,286
Max -- Maxwell, Nanny Fine is not qualified to take care of him. He's a very important child.

42
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:44,914
Unlike my own children? / Woopsie!

43
00:02:46,492 --> 00:02:53,108
I'm picturing the Plaza, which is right down the road from Elizabeth Arden in case he needs a bikini wax.

44
00:02:53,108 --> 00:02:57,493
He'll stay here with us until his parents can join him.

45
00:02:57,493 --> 00:03:00,953
Oh, right. Well, whatever's best for the boy ...

46
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:03,390
This close.

47
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:56,524
Come on, kids, "Royal Flush" is going on.

48
00:03:56,524 --> 00:04:02,560
I like "Full House" better. / No way.  "Royal Flush" beats "Full House" every time.

49
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,573
Oh, look, there he is.

50
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:07,576
Hey!  Yoe!  Whoa!

51
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:10,221
It's a gift from God.

52
00:04:10,221 --> 00:04:12,743
Like Streisand.

53
00:04:12,743 --> 00:04:16,603
No.  He is so obnoxious. / It's TV, Mags. It's a formula.

54
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:20,418
Look, the big sister's an airhead and the little kit's obnoxious,

55
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:24,066
but then he erupts into a teen heartthrob.

56
00:04:24,777 --> 00:04:26,830
Yeah, but he better keep his ego in check.

57
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,800
Otherwise, he's going to be knocking over video stores with Dana Plato.

58
00:04:33,702 --> 00:04:35,622
What happens to the cute little one?

59
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:39,718
She gets a breast reduction and goes to Yale.

60
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:45,128
Please, would you turn that off.  Jack will be here any minute.

61
00:04:45,128 --> 00:04:48,210
Oh, God, look at him.  He can't act.

62
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,184
Ssshhh ...  Here comes the maid.

63
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:54,555
Don't start with me, Clyde.

64
00:04:59,443 --> 00:05:02,058
Oh, just look at the clothes she's wearing.

65
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:06,049
How could she afford to dress like that on her salary?

66
00:05:06,227 --> 00:05:08,533
I know I can't.

67
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:13,192
This is absurd.  The father just stands there like a stunned beast

68
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:17,156
and gives his bloody servants the run of the house.

69
00:05:18,055 --> 00:05:20,897
The servants don't have the run of the house.

70
00:05:20,897 --> 00:05:25,287
Oh,by the way, my mother's coming over to use your jacuzzi tub.

71
00:05:25,696 --> 00:05:28,730
Tell her Level III bubbles and pulsates.

72
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,927
So I've heard.

73
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,148
Okay.  Kids, shut the TV off.

74
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:39,901
The last thing Jack Walker wants to hear is lines from his own show.

75
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,496
Hey!  Yoe!  Whoa!

76
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:46,968
Yeah, like, I haven't heard that in about two seconds.

77
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:50,388
Jack, how was the flight? / Oh, I hate airplane food.  It's loaded with salt.

78
00:05:50,388 --> 00:05:54,096
Look at me.  I'm all bloated.  I look nine.

79
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,414
Jack, I'm Maxwell Sheffield.

80
00:05:56,414 --> 00:05:59,116
Yeah, yeah, how you doing?  Love that tie, babe.

81
00:05:59,116 --> 00:06:01,176
Who is this?

82
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:03,352
Oh, I'm Fran.  And I'm such a big fan.

83
00:06:03,352 --> 00:06:05,337
I've seen every one of your episodes

84
00:06:05,337 --> 00:06:07,513
except for the one that the president interrupted,

85
00:06:07,513 --> 00:06:11,653
like he couldn't invade Haiti during "Blossom."

86
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:17,344
Babbling, Miss Fine. / Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm just so excited.

87
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:19,846
I can't believe I'm meeting little Kippy Cooper.

88
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:23,313
Please pinch me.  Oh!

89
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:27,749
That's just an expression.

90
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:30,497
Jack, come on, let me introduce you to my children.

91
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:32,614
This is Brighten, Grace, and Maggie.

92
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:35,712
Hey, I really dug that episode where you lost your virginity.

93
00:06:35,712 --> 00:06:38,710
Yeah, like I had to act.

94
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:44,166
Brighten, since you'll be sharing a room, why don't you go up and put away your toys, huh?

95
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,828
Toys?  Toys?

96
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:53,615
Why don't you just bring out the home movies of me going pee pee in a cowboy hat and holster.

97
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:58,666
Do you know the Olsen twins? / Intimately.

98
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,257
In fact, I remember when the three of us went to Palm Springs.  We were all in a hot tub and --

99
00:07:02,257 --> 00:07:05,583
Oh, Gracie, it's your bedtime, bedtime.

100
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,546
When's my bedtime?  Want to tuck me in?

101
00:07:08,546 --> 00:07:13,923
You know, you must be a very good actor because on the show you're so endearing.

102
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,832
I don't know why you hired him.

103
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,717
Well, well, well, I guess it just leaves me and you.

104
00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:28,103
Not unless that head screws off and you can put on Jason Priestly's.

105
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:31,716
Right.  Look how she just cuts him off at the knees,

106
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:35,417
from a lump of clay.

107
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:41,742
If you'll excuse me, Jack, I promised your parents I'd telephone that you arrived safely.

108
00:07:41,742 --> 00:07:44,268
How you leave is another matter.

109
00:07:44,268 --> 00:07:47,728
May I take your bags, sir? / Oh, thank you very much, my good man.

110
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:51,557
Here's a hundred.  What do I call you?

111
00:07:51,557 --> 00:07:54,220
Oh, just whistle.

112
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:00,598
All right.  Come on, Damian --

113
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:05,355
I, I mean, Jack. I'll show you around.

114
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:08,749
Yeah, I've been around, but I'll watch you walk. / Oh!

115
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:12,502
JACK:Sorry, just a reflection. / Yeah, so is.

116
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:26,052
How's your pudding, Miss Babcock? / It's delicious.  Why?

117
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:30,708
Just as I thought.  These expiration dates are meaningless.

118
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:40,064
How do you become a full-fledged moron by 12?

119
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:45,798
What are you talking about? / Oh, that Walker kid, the eighth dwarf, Horny.

120
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:52,266
I love Johnny Walker -- I mean, Jack Daniels -- I mean, Jack Walker.

121
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:58,590
Ever since Rob Roy and Tom Collins left her, they've all been a blur.

122
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:04,036
I think he's the most obnoxious sexist brat.

123
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:07,331
He thinks that he can come here, look me up and down,

124
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:09,876
and pinch me just because he makes millions.

125
00:09:09,876 --> 00:09:14,276
Well, he's got a good ten years before he can get away with that.

126
00:09:14,276 --> 00:09:17,145
Who cares?  Your job is to make him happy.

127
00:09:17,145 --> 00:09:19,104
Not at the expense of my kids.

128
00:09:19,104 --> 00:09:23,053
And I'll tell you that Jack Walker is making everyone miserable.

129
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:26,006
God bless Jack Walker.

130
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:27,976
This was the best day of my life.

131
00:09:27,976 --> 00:09:31,868
Good call, Nanny Fine.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

132
00:09:31,868 --> 00:09:34,544
Fran, you should have seen it.  People were hanging all over me.

133
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:39,483
I have finally found my calling in life, sucking up to a famous guy.

134
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:43,709
Oh, honey, you're underestimating yourself.

135
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,952
You don't need Jack Walker to be popular.

136
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:50,507
You got a trust fund that could choke a horse.

137
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:54,013
Do you think it would be okay if I grabbed a bite with Jack and some girls from school?

138
00:09:54,013 --> 00:09:57,360
Oh, your first date.

139
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:05,306
I remember when I was your age. No, I don't.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I do, I do.

140
00:10:05,306 --> 00:10:08,441
You know, Alby Malcolm and I went home for burritos.

141
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,133
Don't do that.

142
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:17,917
Hi, Brighten / Hi, Brighten.

143
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,521
Hi, girls.  I'm Fran, the nanny.

144
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:23,866
Cute bustier.

145
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:26,579
Would you excuse us?

146
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:31,172
Noooooo. / Oh, but, Fran.

147
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:35,183
Just what did you think you were going to do with an eighteen-year-old girl?

148
00:10:35,183 --> 00:10:38,942
I was hoping to feel my way through the situation.

149
00:10:39,757 --> 00:10:42,292
All right, I'll go to my room.

150
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:46,187
Heidi, go to his room. / Heidi, if you ever want to see the Alps again,

151
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:51,318
hit the road.  You too, honey, yod-do-la-e-oo.

152
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:54,242
All right.  We're going to have to lay down some ground rules here.

153
00:10:54,242 --> 00:10:56,113
Oh, yeah?  Who says I gotta listen to you?

154
00:10:56,113 --> 00:11:00,329
Listen, Mister Pister, when you've got a house of your own,

155
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:03,410
you can do whatever you want, but as long as you're under my roof --

156
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,978
Ma, stop throwing your voice.

157
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:10,955
If you don't lay off me, I'm going to call my agent; I'm going to get you fired.

158
00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:15,334
Good.  What do you think?  I'm scared of a little bald man with a cigar?

159
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:17,734
Oh, yeah?  My agent happens to be 34,

160
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:21,423
six-two, with a mansion in Beverly Hills and a Porche.

161
00:11:21,423 --> 00:11:25,531
Oh, well, go ahead and call him.  Better yet, I'll call him.

162
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:31,420
Give me his number and a little privacy because this is right up my alley.

163
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,942
I'm not happy.

164
00:11:34,942 --> 00:11:38,586
You know, you think that you're such a big shot just because you're in show business?

165
00:11:38,586 --> 00:11:40,507
Why don't you act like a normal kid?

166
00:11:40,507 --> 00:11:45,782
You should be out riding your bicycle, torturing your sister, buying fake dooty.

167
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:48,208
Don't you even have any friends?

168
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:52,238
Sure, I do.  My agent, my manager, my publicist.

169
00:11:52,514 --> 00:11:55,351
Yes, little buddy.

170
00:11:57,727 --> 00:12:01,437
Right on time.  Here.  Just for being you.

171
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:04,229
Love to love you, baby.

172
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:11,741
Name me one person that doesn't make a buck off of you besides your parents?

173
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:14,963
Well, actually, we're in litigation.

174
00:12:14,963 --> 00:12:20,025
You're suing your own parents?  How can you do that? / They're riping me off.

175
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:22,610
No, I mean how can you do that because my folks --

176
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,272
ah, they don't have any money.

177
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:29,902
You know, Niles, I've had it up to here with that kid.  Either he goes or I do.

178
00:12:29,902 --> 00:12:32,321
Well, let's see.  For bringing him a glass of milk,

179
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:37,522
he gave me $100, for my birthday, you gave me a comb.

180
00:12:41,124 --> 00:12:43,510
Mr. Sheffield, I have to talk to you.

181
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,325
Oh, no, Miss Fine.  I want to talk to you.

182
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:49,429
Oh, if it's about the clogged Jacuzzi, I'm sorry,

183
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:54,974
but once my mother starts scrubbing with a loofa, it's like making snow in Lillehammer.

184
00:12:57,101 --> 00:13:02,326
No, Miss Fine.  I want to thank you for convincing me to hire Jack.

185
00:13:02,326 --> 00:13:05,253
Maxwell, that was my idea.

186
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:09,050
What do I have to do to please anyone around this house?

187
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,428
Niles ...

188
00:13:13,678 --> 00:13:17,519
But, sir, fish gotta swim.

189
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,131
Control yourself, man. / Oh, very well, sir.

190
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:25,083
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. / Lemon?

191
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:32,940
Look, Miss Fine, his marquee value alone has the investors throwing money at me.

192
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,165
You wonderful woman you.  Oh, I could just kiss you.

193
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:46,071
Well, how long's the kid going to be here, a week?

194
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:50,127
Mr. Sheffield? / Oh, let me get that for you, sir.

195
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:54,362
Thanks, old man. / Pleasure.

196
00:13:56,809 --> 00:14:00,689
Here's my little "Oliver."  Ha, ha.

197
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:04,217
Oh, please, sir, I want some more.

198
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:06,655
No, I haven't memorized all my lines yet.

199
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:10,686
Well, it's the first one.  We're opening soon. / Hoo-hoo, tick-tock.

200
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:15,404
Yeah.  That's what I want to talk to you about. I'm quitting show business.

201
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:20,159
You're quitting what? / I just want to be a normal kid, and I want out.

202
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,239
And out you shall be just as soon as "Oliver" finishes its three-year run.

203
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:30,803
No, now.  I'm sorry.

204
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:36,816
Ohhhhh!

205
00:14:37,951 --> 00:14:40,056
How can this happen?

206
00:14:40,056 --> 00:14:45,903
Oh, I don't know.  Probably some whacko putting ideas into his head.

207
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:52,764
Fran, I just wanted to thank you. / Oh, honey, there's no reason to thank me.

208
00:14:52,764 --> 00:14:55,604
No, no, I wanted to thank you -- / Please, I just made you a sandwich.

209
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,817
If it wasn't for your advice -- / Honey, you're embarrassing me.

210
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:04,571
No.  If it wasn't for your advice, I would have spent the rest of my life as an actor making other people rich.

211
00:15:07,803 --> 00:15:11,010
Do you smell gas?

212
00:15:18,975 --> 00:15:23,106
Nanny Fine, you're alone in the room with the kid for two minutes

213
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:26,772
and he wants to quit show business?

214
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:31,314
God, if only we could put her in a room with Tori Spelling.

215
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,882
I could kill you.

216
00:15:36,882 --> 00:15:42,541
I could rip out your heart with my bare lands.

217
00:15:43,502 --> 00:15:47,311
She doesn't have a key to the house, does she?

218
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:53,149
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, maybe it's all for the best.

219
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:56,351
No, it is not all for the best, Miss Fine.

220
00:15:56,351 --> 00:15:58,889
It is not all for the best at all.

221
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:02,653
But you yourself said that the kid was a pain in the butt.

222
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:05,651
All right, Miss Fine.  Let me see if you can follow this, huh?

223
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:10,097
Sky -- blue.  Fire -- hot.

224
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:13,668
Actor -- pain in the butt.

225
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:19,829
You are going to rectify this situation. / Wow!  That sounds painful.

226
00:16:22,034 --> 00:16:27,067
Yes.  Thanks to you, in eight weeks the curtain goes up on a six-foot,

227
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:33,975
300-pound stage manager with a Mohawk singing "Consider Yourself One of Us."

228
00:16:34,212 --> 00:16:37,742
Well, all right.  What do you have in mind?

229
00:16:37,742 --> 00:16:40,848
You're going to talk him back into the show. / Oh, but Mr. Sheffield ...

230
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:44,728
No butts, Miss Fine.  You are going to march yourself upstairs,

231
00:16:44,728 --> 00:16:48,047
put on something smashing, take him to the best restaurant in town,

232
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:50,885
and order the most expensive thing on the menu.

233
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:57,249
Well, all right, but I'm not taking the limo. / Oh, yes, you are.

234
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,835
Slave driver ...

235
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:09,736
But there is no way you're going to buy me a new dress.

236
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:11,989
Get out!

237
00:17:14,182 --> 00:17:16,184
This close.

238
00:17:20,075 --> 00:17:22,012
Right this way.

239
00:17:23,954 --> 00:17:26,469
Oh, how's the fish?

240
00:17:28,354 --> 00:17:32,981
Boy, I cannot believe who is sitting right over there.

241
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:37,821
Oh, you mean Jack Nickelson?  Jack, Jack, over here.  How you doing?

242
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,743
No, no, to the right, to the right.

243
00:17:41,743 --> 00:17:44,570
Oh, you mean Whoopie?  Whoopie, over here.

244
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,141
What's up?  How you doing?

245
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:53,933
What are you blind?  Behind me, behind me.  It's Bob Barker.

246
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:56,448
Who?

247
00:17:56,773 --> 00:18:01,334
Oh, sir, this table is definitely not going to work.  I'm in a terrible draft.

248
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:08,371
Hello, I'm Fran. / Hello ...  Bob Barker.

249
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,408
Oh, Bob Barker.  I'm your biggest fan.

250
00:18:14,408 --> 00:18:17,821
You know, I know that I'm wearing an animal print, but it's fake,

251
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:22,185
not these.  These are real.  I mean the dress.

252
00:18:22,438 --> 00:18:27,129
I just want you to know everyone in my family has been spayed and neutered.

253
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:31,943
Their pets. Did I tell you I just love the "Price is Right"?

254
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:35,189
I was just getting the check. / Oh, wait, let me guess.

255
00:18:35,189 --> 00:18:38,332
Pasta primavera, 18.95? / Higher.

256
00:18:38,332 --> 00:18:41,945
Oh, I don't want to go over.

257
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,752
Excuse me.

258
00:18:45,034 --> 00:18:48,429
Bye, Bob, my table's ready.

259
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:52,820
Oh, I can't believe you want to give all of this up.

260
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,318
Fran, I'm been schmoozing since I was two.

261
00:18:55,318 --> 00:18:58,910
My first words were "I want to renegotiate."

262
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:03,026
My first words were "Can I take a bath if I wore it?"

263
00:19:03,987 --> 00:19:08,379
Fran, I want you to know that you were right.  I just want to be a regular kid.

264
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:15,005
Oh, honey, you can be a regular kid and still be a big star with an exciting life.

265
00:19:15,005 --> 00:19:17,497
Or you can be the kid sitting at home watching TV

266
00:19:17,497 --> 00:19:21,518
night after night neglecting his studies, getting fired from the bridal shop,

267
00:19:21,518 --> 00:19:25,584
ending up being a nanny -- I'm getting sidetracked here.

268
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:29,174
But you said that you --/ Oh, forget about what I said.  You've got a gift.

269
00:19:29,174 --> 00:19:35,923
Do you think Einstein listened to his nanny when she said "Put down the books and comb your hair"?

270
00:19:36,507 --> 00:19:40,027
Fran, I'm no Einstein.  He wrote the theory of relatively.

271
00:19:40,027 --> 00:19:42,074
I wrote "Hey!  Yoe!  Whoa!"

272
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:49,243
Oh, big deal.  He said MC's a square.  Well, Ed McMahan's been proving that for years.

273
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:55,654
Fran, is Mr. Sheffield going to hold me to my contract?

274
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:59,784
Well, I don't know, honey.  I mean, I'm not a lawyer.

275
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:04,220
Maybe you should ask the people that you hired to sue your mommy and your daddy.

276
00:20:07,602 --> 00:20:12,382
Fran, I can't do this anymore. / Oh, sweetie.

277
00:20:12,382 --> 00:20:17,386
Ah, look, you know what?  I'll talk to Mr. Sheffield.  How's that?

278
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:19,015
Hey, Kippy ...

279
00:20:26,898 --> 00:20:28,477
Your aspirin, sir.

280
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,839
Ssshhh ...  You hear that sucking sound?

281
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,688
That's the investors pulling their money out of my show.

282
00:20:35,688 --> 00:20:38,296
Oh, I too shall lament the loss of Mr. Walker.

283
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:41,182
He filled the house with tips ...

284
00:20:42,155 --> 00:20:44,287
joy.

285
00:20:46,229 --> 00:20:52,154
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, I'm so proud of you. You're really doing the right thing.

286
00:20:52,154 --> 00:20:55,382
Every kid deserves to have a normal childhood.

287
00:20:55,382 --> 00:21:00,536
Excuse me.  Brighten, if you throw darts at your Picasso one more time,

288
00:21:00,536 --> 00:21:03,874
I'm taking it out of your room.

289
00:21:03,874 --> 00:21:05,719
Oh, there he is. Be nice.

290
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:09,019
I am being nice, Miss Fine.  If I weren't, you'd be going with him.

291
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:13,443
Oh, more of that British humor I've become so fond of.

292
00:21:13,443 --> 00:21:16,215
Well, I guess I have everything.  Hey, Brighten, see you, man.

293
00:21:16,215 --> 00:21:22,079
Yeah, we'll see you.  I could cry.  I came this close to having a life.

294
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:26,591
No, you didn't. / Oh, Maggie, by the way, I called Jason Priestly for you.

295
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:30,150
You did? / Yeah, but he doesn't date women taller than him,

296
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:34,166
so maybe if you unscrewed your head ...

297
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,762
Don't go.

298
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:40,163
Hey, so long, Grace.  Sorry we didn't get to know each other better.

299
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:44,409
That's okay.  Fran and I went through all your luggage.

300
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:49,131
Sweetie, we were just playing midnight express.

301
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:50,535
Bye, Fran.

302
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:53,979
Oh, bye, honey.  Have a good childhood. / Thanks.

303
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,486
Mr. Sheffield, thanks a lot for helping me get out of my contract.

304
00:21:57,486 --> 00:22:03,746
Well, it was a pleasure, Jack, and all the very best of luck to you. / You too.

305
00:22:03,746 --> 00:22:07,523
Safe trip, sir. / Thanks a lot, Niles.

306
00:22:08,397 --> 00:22:10,897
Well, don't you feel good?

307
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:15,094
I feel poor.  I feel good and poor.

308
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:19,347
Oh, God, we just got rid of that twerp and now he's on "Good Day New York."

309
00:22:19,347 --> 00:22:23,828
What a life.  The poor guy can't even go back to his childhood in privacy.

310
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:28,265
Hey!  Yoe!  Whoa!  Jack Walker,  America's favorite boy next door

311
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:34,133
has settled with the producers of "Royal Flush" for a staggering $85,000 a week ...

312
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:37,201
... providing he can get out of his Broadway contract.

313
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:42,077
In this reporter's opinion, you'd have to be a pretty big Broadway boob to let that happen.

314
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:45,061
This is Liz Smith.

315
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,809
Miss Fine?

316
00:22:47,221 --> 00:22:51,370
And you said he couldn't act.
