1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,625
So, Fran, did you finish 
sewing my bear? / Uh-huh.

2
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:13,459
And while I was in there, 
I took some of the stuffing out of
 her stomach and I put it in her lips.

3
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:17,179
I wanted her to look
 like a Care Bear.

4
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:20,423
Well, now she looks
 like a Cher Bear.

5
00:00:21,785 --> 00:00:24,277
Oh, wow.  Hi, Mr. Sheffield.

6
00:00:24,277 --> 00:00:26,922
Don't you look handsome. 
 Got a hot date tonight?

7
00:00:26,922 --> 00:00:31,142
Yes, but I'm missing a stud.
 / Yeah, well, who isn't?

8
00:00:32,388 --> 00:00:35,138
Forget it, I'm not taking you
 to the movies, you little worm!

9
00:00:35,138 --> 00:00:37,633
Well, why not, your friends won't mind. 
 They're really nice to me.

10
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:41,016
That's 'cause I told them you
 only had six months to live.

11
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:43,484
So what time is my curfew tonight?

12
00:00:43,484 --> 00:00:46,814
Ten if you go with the worm,
 nine if you go wormless.

13
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,456
There.  Now you're perfect.
 / Thank you, Miss Fein.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,185
Oh, where are you goin'?
 / Oh, tonight is my Butler's Association Meeting.

15
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:57,682
Oh, a walk on the wild side? 
/ Hm, you said it.

16
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:02,161
Sometimes we listen to recordings
 of doorbells and don't get up.

17
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:08,053
Ah, yeah.  Well, Gracie, it looks
 like it's just you and me, babe.

18
00:01:08,053 --> 00:01:11,680
I've got a dinner date.
 Spaghetti-O's at Bernard's

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,194
Well, can I come
 if I bring my own can?

20
00:01:14,194 --> 00:01:18,779
Sorry.  Our relationship's
 at that fragile stage.

21
00:01:21,158 --> 00:01:23,773
Everybody's got their own 
life but me.

22
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:26,331
Well, Cher, "I Got You Babe."

23
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,835
Oh, thank God.

24
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:33,784
Hi, Fran. I knew you'd be home. 
/ Hi, Val.  Yeah, well, it's official.

25
00:01:33,784 --> 00:01:35,558
I peeked in high school.

26
00:01:35,558 --> 00:01:39,279
I rented "Single White Female" 
and I picked up a box of Slim Fast Bars.

27
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:43,374
You know, Val, after ten bars 
you don't get slim so fast.

28
00:01:43,374 --> 00:01:47,426
Do I have news for you. 
/ Danny broke up with Heather Biblow?

29
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:52,132
How'd you hear that? / Oh, from
 the information super- highway:  my mother.

30
00:01:52,132 --> 00:01:55,838
Did she tell you Danny's been 
askin' about you non-stop?

31
00:01:55,838 --> 00:01:57,546
Oh, I could care less.

32
00:01:57,546 --> 00:02:00,841
You know, when I dumped him and marched
 myself out of that bridal shop ....

33
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:03,477
No, remember, Danny dumped 
you for Heather Biblow,

34
00:02:03,477 --> 00:02:06,045
and then he fired you so 
she could have your job.

35
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:10,679
Val, it was a while ago. 
 It's all very fuzzy.  Okay?

36
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,304
Just go talk to him, Frannie. 
 You two are meant for each other.

37
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:17,841
Look, Val, the guy dumped me. 
 There isn't anything that you're gonna say

38
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:21,347
or do that's gonna make me wanna 
set foot into that bridal shop.

39
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:24,287
This time you can dump him.

40
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:27,241
Hm.  What time does he open?

41
00:03:16,951 --> 00:03:20,231
We got a customer, Mr. Imperiale.
 / Hi.

42
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:25,202
You brought the kids here? 
/ Well, I woulda tied 'em to the meter,
 but Mr. Sheffield frowns on that.

43
00:03:25,202 --> 00:03:31,210
Maggie, look.  It's your new boyfriend.
  Ah, he's got your personality, too.

44
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,782
And your equipment.

45
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,314
Fran?  Babe?  Look at you! 
 You look like a million bucks.

46
00:03:40,314 --> 00:03:45,158
Well, just somethin' I threw together. 
/ You changed your outfit fifteen times.

47
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,073
Ah, she can't count.  She's only six.
 / I'm seven.

48
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:50,051
See what I mean?

49
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:54,399
C'mon, kids.  Let's go check
 the pay phones for quarters.

50
00:03:56,274 --> 00:04:00,137
Fran, I .... You know,
 my mother really misses you.

51
00:04:00,137 --> 00:04:03,058
Oh, did she get the Isotoners
 I sent her for Christmas?

52
00:04:03,058 --> 00:04:07,466
Yeah, that was really sweet.  You know,
 especially considering the ... circumstances.

53
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:12,135
Hm-hm.  Well, I don't hate her guts. 
 She didn't dump me for Heather Biblow!

54
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:17,929
Look, I'm sorry.  I had to have a cheap
 tawdry affair just to really appreciate you.

55
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:20,702
You were with her for six months.

56
00:04:20,702 --> 00:04:23,194
I had to be sure.

57
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,775
Well, I could care less.
 / Look, if you could care less ...

58
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:29,645
then why do you come down here
 lookin' like you're lookin'?

59
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:33,611
Just to let you know what you're 
never gonna have again.  Suffer.

60
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:34,948
I am ....

61
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:38,072
Frannie, I still want you.

62
00:04:38,072 --> 00:04:42,216
And ... somethin' tells me
 you still want me, too.

63
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:46,125
I don't!

64
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:52,917
I don't ....

65
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:00,757
Ah ... ah ....

66
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:07,759
No, I'm not comin' 
back here so that

67
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,810
I can waste another three years of my life 
waiting for you not to ask me to marry you.

68
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,607
All right.  All right. 
 I'm gonna do it right now.

69
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:19,043
Come here.  Frannie Fein ...

70
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,749
will you marry me?
 / What?

71
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:24,560
I'm askin' you to marry me. 
 I miss ya.  I love you.

72
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,504
C'mon, whadaya say? 
/ What do I say?

73
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:33,391
You led me on for three years.  
You cheated on me.  You fired me ....

74
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:41,261
So?

75
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,889
So, I'm gonna have to
 think about it.

76
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:49,162
Ma?

77
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:52,318
... Ma, good news. 
 It finally happened.

78
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,540
I got proposed to.

79
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,035
Thank you!

80
00:05:57,386 --> 00:06:02,364
Sima bon, mazel tov, 
mazel tov, sima bon ....

81
00:06:02,364 --> 00:06:04,611
Ma!  Ma!  Calm down.

82
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:08,152
You're gonna make it start to rain.

83
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:14,871
Oh, Frannie, your father and I have been 
waiting for this day since the moment you were born.

84
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:17,831
Now we can die.

85
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:21,658
Morty, you can start smoking again!

86
00:06:21,868 --> 00:06:26,896
Ma, I haven't said yes yet. 
/ Morty, put away the cigar!

87
00:06:26,896 --> 00:06:30,390
What is to think about?  
He's handsome, he's rich,

88
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:36,233
he's already got three children, which,
 trust me, your pelvis will thank you for.

89
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:39,411
Ma, it's not Mr. Sheffield.
 / It's not?

90
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:43,667
No!  The boss never marries the help.
  Look at Tony and Angela.

91
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:48,328
Eight years he wasted on her. 
 He was so heartbroken. 
 He skied into a tree.

92
00:06:48,328 --> 00:06:51,971
Major Nelson and Jeannie 
tied the knot.

93
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:54,645
If she had any commitment 
at all to that relationship,

94
00:06:54,645 --> 00:06:56,678
she would have given up her apartment.

95
00:06:56,678 --> 00:07:00,872
It was a bottle. 
 They kept it on top of the mantle.

96
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:04,008
All I'm sayin' is ... 
what the hell am I sayin'?

97
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:06,479
How the hell should I know? 
 So who are you marrying?

98
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,243
Danny!  Who do you think!? 
/ Oy!

99
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:14,128
What?  What's the matter?  You were 
always so hot to see me and Danny together.

100
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:16,307
Now you're givin' me
 a lukewarm "oy"?

101
00:07:16,307 --> 00:07:20,273
I didn't like the way he treated
 you during that whole Heather Biblow thing.

102
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,460
He's a real trumpanick.

103
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,069
So he made a mistake.  
He begged me to come back.

104
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:30,379
He cried that he loved me. 
/ He cried?

105
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:33,604
Oh, I love a man who cries.

106
00:07:33,604 --> 00:07:37,580
Except Jerry Lewis at the
 end of the telethon.

107
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:42,655
Ma, I don't know what to do. 
 Tell me what to do.

108
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:44,333
I don't know.  Do you love him?

109
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:48,694
How do you ever know?  How did you know
 that you were in love with Dad?

110
00:07:48,694 --> 00:07:52,124
Hm.  His dimples. 
/ Daddy doesn't have dimples.

111
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:54,630
Not where you could see.

112
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,663
And he always treated me like a lady.

113
00:07:58,663 --> 00:08:01,736
Every weekend he would take me
 to his favorite restaurant

114
00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:06,652
and he never once let me 
carry my own tray.

115
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:13,032
Well, Danny is not quite as gallant 
as Dad was, but I'll tell ya ...

116
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:19,021
when he took me in his arms today and
 kissed me, boy, did he bring back memories.

117
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:22,203
It reminded me of the time when
 you and Dad went to Puerto Rico

118
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:25,186
and Danny came over and I said,

119
00:08:25,186 --> 00:08:29,459
"You can't come in here, Danny Imperiale,
 because my parents said ...

120
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:33,282
no boys allowed."
 / Hm-hm.

121
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:37,640
Oh, Ma.  I don't know what to do.

122
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,618
I mean, all my life I've been wanting 
Danny to propose, and now that he finally does,

123
00:08:42,618 --> 00:08:45,909
all I keep thinkin' about is 
how much I love those three kids.

124
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:50,120
I know, sweetheart, 
but it's still just a job.

125
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,024
Don't you want
 a life of your own?

126
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:55,062
You know I do.

127
00:08:55,062 --> 00:08:57,367
So?

128
00:08:57,642 --> 00:09:00,389
So, I ... I guess I'm gettin' married.

129
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:03,410
Mazel Tov.  Light up, Morty!

130
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,422
Mazel Tov im kumo tas ... 
mazel tov im kumo tas ... mazel tov im ...

131
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:12,241
hey ney ... noo .... 
/ Ma!!!!

132
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:20,342
Oh, Niles, don't take it so hard.

133
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:23,270
Ah ... it's the onions.

134
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,482
I mean, I can still come 
and visit.

135
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,975
You can come to Queens. 
 We can go bowling. / Oh ... oh ....

136
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:33,008
You don't like bowling?  We can
 play miniature golf. / That's better.

137
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:35,368
Say, where should 
I have the engagement party?

138
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:39,405
Mongolian Barbecue or
 Benny's Clam Bar?

139
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:43,123
Tough choice. 
 Which has the indoor restrooms?

140
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:47,247
Oh ... you think that's important? 
 All right.  Benny's.

141
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:50,521
Why don't you have it at your favorite 
little Italian place in the Village?

142
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:54,510
Oh, nah.  Danny doesn't really
 like to come into the city.

143
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,153
Oh, yes.  Manhattan has 
so little to offer.

144
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:00,897
All right, so we don't have
 as much in common as we used to,

145
00:10:00,897 --> 00:10:03,207
but I'll work on all 
that after we're married.

146
00:10:03,207 --> 00:10:07,331
Good thinking.  
Men are so easy to change.

147
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,074
What's that supposed to mean?

148
00:10:11,074 --> 00:10:13,214
Oh, nothing.

149
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:15,480
Have you told Mr. Sheffield yet?

150
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,459
No, but ... you know ... 
he's so busy and ...

151
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:24,159
I don't wanna just barge in. 
/ Yes, I know how you hate to do that.

152
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:27,239
Mr. Sheffield, I'm getting married.

153
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:29,585
Ya-hoo ....

154
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:31,608
I mean, you?  To who?

155
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:34,813
Oh, it doesn't matter. 
 You need a dress?  A ring?  A ride to Temple?

156
00:10:34,813 --> 00:10:37,283
Oh ... I'm feeling positively giddy!

157
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:39,935
I have a million phone calls
 to make.  I am so happy!

158
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:42,064
For you, dear.

159
00:10:45,971 --> 00:10:49,252
Happy is not 
a good color for that woman.

160
00:10:49,252 --> 00:10:54,103
So ... who's the lucky man? 
/ Danny Imperiale.

161
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:56,606
What!?  I can't believe it! 
 After he lied

162
00:10:56,606 --> 00:11:00,664
and cheated on you with
 Heather Biblow?  How could you?

163
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,195
Well ... if I could forgive him,

164
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:07,968
I would think you certainly could.

165
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:12,298
Right.  Oh, well, then, 
this is good news.

166
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:15,119
Well, I couldn't be happier for you.

167
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:17,939
You couldn't?  Ah, me, too.

168
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:22,324
I ... I ... I suppose this 
means you'll be leaving us?

169
00:11:22,324 --> 00:11:26,735
Ah, guess so.  But I'll stay on 
until you find someone to replace me.

170
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:29,888
Oh, oh, no one could ever replace you, 
Miss Fein. / Oh.

171
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:33,810
Who else is gonna turn out to breakfast 
in those loud, inappropriate bathrobes?

172
00:11:34,303 --> 00:11:37,209
I'll leave a few for Niles.

173
00:11:38,977 --> 00:11:46,647
Well ... you'll be greatly missed
 ... by the children.

174
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:48,671
I'll miss them, too.

175
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:51,013
Well, I wish you all the luck
 in the world. / Thank you.

176
00:11:51,013 --> 00:11:53,898
And ... listen, I'd ... I'd like
 to help you with your honeymoon.

177
00:11:53,898 --> 00:11:57,380
Oh, well, that's a little breaking
 with tradition, but I'll ask Danny.

178
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,805
Oh ... no, Miss Fein, I ... 
I ... I meant financially.

179
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,400
Oh, well ... that'll be nice, too.

180
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,423
So w-would you like me to be there 
when you tell the children?

181
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:10,874
Oh, do we have to tell the children?

182
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:14,244
I think they'll notice
 you're missing.

183
00:12:14,244 --> 00:12:17,194
Can't you just tell them
 I'm taking a bath?

184
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,094
Miss Fein, you'll be gone forever.

185
00:12:19,094 --> 00:12:21,887
Tell me I'm puttin' on my make-up.

186
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:31,332
Children, Miss Fein has
 something to tell you.

187
00:12:31,332 --> 00:12:33,918
Oh, sorry.  Go on.

188
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:40,297
I can't. / Oh, c'mon, Miss Fein. It ...
 it won't be as hard as you think.

189
00:12:44,017 --> 00:12:46,652
Well, remember Danny 
from the Bridal Shop?

190
00:12:46,652 --> 00:12:50,502
Oh, you mean that back-stabbing, 
two-timing creep? / Uh-huh.

191
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:53,819
Well, he's getting married 
and you're all invited.

192
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:55,737
Oh, that's great ....  
That'll be fun ....

193
00:12:55,737 --> 00:12:59,190
So ... where did
 he find that loser?

194
00:12:59,823 --> 00:13:01,970
I know, I know.

195
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,289
Oh, my God.  You're getting married?

196
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:09,714
Well, that is going to be a problem.

197
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:13,624
Your closet's barely big enough 
for your clothes.

198
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:18,930
He's not moving in with her. 
/ Well, that's not gonna be much of a marriage.

199
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,622
Wake up, twerp.  Fran's leaving us.

200
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:30,506
Don't worry, children, 
you still have Aunt C.C.

201
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:34,782
Oh, c'mon, children. 
 You'll still be able to see Miss Fein.

202
00:13:34,782 --> 00:13:37,757
Yeah, yeah, that's right, 
on all the major holidays.

203
00:13:37,757 --> 00:13:40,357
We'll spend Christmas together,
 Fourth of July,

204
00:13:40,357 --> 00:13:43,125
the back room sale at Lohman's.

205
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,535
Oh, sure, we'll stay in touch for a while, 
but then you'll just forget us.

206
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:49,220
And we'll forget her.

207
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,260
Hey, kids, you know when 
I'm down in the dumps what cheers me up?

208
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,494
A fifth of Scotch and 
a fresh pack of batteries?

209
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:06,360
Oh, oh, Nanny Fein. 
 How I'll miss that wit.

210
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,716
No.  Actually,
 I was referring to singing.

211
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:14,355
"For she's a jolly good fellow, 
for she's a jolly good fellow,

212
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:19,583
for she's a jolly good fellow,
 which nobody can deny.

213
00:14:22,472 --> 00:14:27,625
Which nobody can deny ...
 which nobody can deny ...."

214
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:36,916
Oh, thank you so much. 
 We'll call you

215
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,625
when hell freezes over.

216
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:43,303
What was wrong with her, sir? 
 She has twenty years experience,

217
00:14:43,303 --> 00:14:46,216
speaks five languages, 
is a registered nurse.

218
00:14:46,216 --> 00:14:48,993
She had no style.  
No sense of humor.

219
00:14:48,993 --> 00:14:52,900
And her hair was oddly flat.

220
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,281
You're right, sir. 
 I don't know what I was thinking.

221
00:14:57,281 --> 00:15:01,233
Well, the truth is, Niles, I've come 
to depend on Miss Fein for everything.

222
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:05,789
Everything, sir? / Well, all those things 
I don't depend on you for.

223
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:09,837
Who could have known it would 
be so hard to say goodbye?

224
00:15:09,837 --> 00:15:11,918
Well, actually, it's not
 goodbye for me, sir.

225
00:15:11,918 --> 00:15:15,704
Miss Fein is taking me miniature
 golfing next week.

226
00:15:15,704 --> 00:15:18,552
I just wish to God there 
was some way to ...

227
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:23,155
no, no.  It just wouldn't be right to
 interfere with Miss Fein's chance of happiness.

228
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:28,084
Yes ... after all, some of us 
only get one shot at it, don't we, sir?

229
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:31,158
I was in love once.

230
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:34,490
I say I was in love once.

231
00:15:34,744 --> 00:15:37,205
Oh, I'm sorry, Niles.  
Do you want to tell me about it?

232
00:15:37,205 --> 00:15:39,632
It was Katherine, 
the housekeeper.

233
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:41,887
We never spoke of it,
 but there were signs.

234
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:46,202
A look, a wink, a shared laugh.  
But I never did anything about it.

235
00:15:46,202 --> 00:15:49,147
So she married someone else and
 I never saw her again.

236
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:53,023
Of course, no one ever knew. 
/ Oh, good God, man, the whole house knew.

237
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:57,207
We were taking bets on when
 you two would get together.

238
00:15:57,609 --> 00:16:00,447
The incredible thing is you
 let her get away.

239
00:16:00,447 --> 00:16:05,311
Yes, I was remarkably stupid, 
wasn't I, sir?

240
00:16:11,515 --> 00:16:15,814
Why can't we just tell Fran not to go? 
/ Because it's something she wants.

241
00:16:15,814 --> 00:16:18,826
And since we're her friends,
 we should want it for her.

242
00:16:18,826 --> 00:16:22,470
Can't you just offer her 
some more money? / Brighton!

243
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,467
I have, it didn't work.

244
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,885
You never offered
 Katherine more money.

245
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:30,528
I could have had a life.

246
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:35,000
If Katherine had ever cleaned 
behind the refrigerator, you might.

247
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,472
This is good, we're all venting. 
 It'll make us feel better.

248
00:16:39,472 --> 00:16:41,914
Oh, shut up, Gracie.

249
00:16:41,914 --> 00:16:45,813
Wow, you're right.  
I do feel better.

250
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:49,496
Oh, c'mon, everyone.  
I know it's hard to say goodbye,

251
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:52,374
but I want us all to
 act like grownups.

252
00:16:52,374 --> 00:16:56,922
"... nobody can deny,
 which nobody can deny."

253
00:16:56,922 --> 00:17:02,008
Why so glum?  It's a happy occasion. 
 She's getting married.

254
00:17:02,008 --> 00:17:05,856
Oh, you people are so selfish.

255
00:17:06,956 --> 00:17:09,643
Miss Fein, may I help you with those?

256
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:12,653
Maybe you could just take
 my make-up bag.

257
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,511
Oh.

258
00:17:17,982 --> 00:17:20,430
Isn't anybody going to say anything?

259
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,486
Hey, Frannie!  C'mon, honey, 
I'm double parked down here!

260
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,147
Oh, oh, he sounds charming!

261
00:17:31,331 --> 00:17:34,743
Look at her go. / The woman
 could deliver for Dominoes.

262
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:38,676
Yeah.  If she doesn't 
come hot, she's free.

263
00:17:38,676 --> 00:17:41,162
Come in, come in.  
She's all ready to go.

264
00:17:41,162 --> 00:17:44,160
Hey, hey. / Oh, hi, Danny.  Hi ....

265
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,959
Hey, hey, hey.

266
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:50,771
I just want you to meet my boss, Maxwell 
Sheffield. This is Danny Imperiale.

267
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:53,004
How's it hangin'? / I beg your pardon?

268
00:17:53,004 --> 00:17:58,559
Oh ... we have a little bit of a language 
barrier here. Mr. Sheffield speaks English.

269
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,521
Come on, children,
 help me with the luggage.

270
00:18:00,521 --> 00:18:05,307
Oh I'm gonna buy you a whole new set
 for the honeymoon.  These bags are so old.

271
00:18:05,307 --> 00:18:07,563
It takes one to know one.

272
00:18:07,563 --> 00:18:10,483
Dink, buy me a Coke.

273
00:18:10,483 --> 00:18:15,552
Oh, you, scarecrow, 
I'm gonna miss most of all.

274
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:20,009
I'll get the rest of your things.
 / Yeah, thanks.

275
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:25,209
It's the powder blue van with Danny's
 Parisian Bride's For Less printed on both sides.

276
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:30,108
Oh, thank you.  We could have been 
wandering out there for hours.

277
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:32,152
Well, honey, take a
 last look around.

278
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:36,040
Your nanny days are over. 
/ We'll certainly miss her.

279
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,334
You know, if you're in a little bit of 
a bind, I mean, I could work a few days a week.

280
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:44,539
Monday through Friday. 
/ No way Danny Imperiale's wife is gonna take a job.

281
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:46,916
I thought you wanted me
 to work in the bridal shop?

282
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,735
Yeah, but I wasn't gonna pay you.
 Are you kidding?

283
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:52,588
C'mon, honey, you're gonna be
 a lady of leisure.

284
00:18:52,588 --> 00:18:55,428
You're just gonna cook and clean
 and take care of me and take care of the kids.

285
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:58,618
Oh, yabba-dabba-doo.  
I don't have to walk Dino?

286
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,200
Well, Miss Fein, 
is that everything?

287
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,363
Yeah, I guess so.  Unless you wanna 
give me this one as a parting gift.

288
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:12,072
I wrote you a poem, Fran. 
/ You did?

289
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:15,078
"F" is for the fun we have together.

290
00:19:15,078 --> 00:19:17,719
"R" is for the rummy that we play.

291
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:20,492
"A" is for the answers 
to my questions.

292
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,515
And "N" is for 
the nasal things you say.

293
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:31,159
Ohhhh.....

294
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:34,159
We're all gonna miss that sound.

295
00:19:35,516 --> 00:19:37,753
C'mon, honey, the tunnel
 is backin' up here.

296
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:40,730
Oh, yeah, yeah.  I love you.

297
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,650
I love you.  I'll call you.

298
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,309
Brighton, don't you wanna give
 me a hug? / No, I hate you!

299
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:51,053
Oh, c'mon, B.  You're not makin'
 this any easier on me.

300
00:19:51,053 --> 00:19:53,610
Yeah, well, why should I?  
You're not makin' this very easy on us.

301
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,543
Now, Brighton, that's quite enough.
 / Well, he's right.

302
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:00,438
I mean, you told us to pretend like 
we're happy about this, but we're not.

303
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:02,739
We're losing our best friend.

304
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:05,366
You're telling them to lie
 about their feelings?

305
00:20:05,366 --> 00:20:08,794
I haven't even gone yet and 
you're already making mistakes?

306
00:20:08,794 --> 00:20:12,182
I did it for you. You think
 it's easy for us to stand here

307
00:20:12,182 --> 00:20:15,915
and watch you walk out that door 
and throw your life away on that Neanderthal?

308
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,538
Huh?

309
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:22,295
Well, I'm sorry, old man, but .... 
/ Hey, hey, I'm younger than you.

310
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:28,112
Miss Fein ... all right, it's true. 
 The children will miss you.

311
00:20:28,112 --> 00:20:30,293
I'll miss you.

312
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:35,227
But you've made us all so happy here we ...
 we just want you to be happy now.

313
00:20:35,731 --> 00:20:38,429
I don't wanna go.

314
00:20:39,094 --> 00:20:42,971
Do something, you big oaf! 
/ You're damn right I will.

315
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,661
C'mon, honey, you're
 embarrassing me here.

316
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:50,280
Danny, I don't ...
 I don't wanna hurt you, but ...

317
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,383
I think I've outgrown you.

318
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:56,573
No, honey, you're
 just wearin' heels.

319
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,645
Were you always this stupid?

320
00:21:02,645 --> 00:21:06,673
Yeah.  Nothin' changed.

321
00:21:07,257 --> 00:21:09,984
Maybe you got a little smarter.

322
00:21:09,984 --> 00:21:13,199
No, I think he was
 always this stupid.

323
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:17,382
Hey, are you dumping me? 
/ No, I would never ....

324
00:21:17,382 --> 00:21:19,951
Hm, come to think of it,
 I think I am.

325
00:21:19,951 --> 00:21:22,111
Gee, it doesn't feel 
as good as I thought it would.

326
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:25,380
Baby, I love you ... 
and you love me.

327
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,254
At least you love this, huh?

328
00:21:31,251 --> 00:21:34,908
And I still got it. 
/ Yeah

329
00:21:34,908 --> 00:21:37,704
but I don't want it anymore.

330
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:40,787
No? 
/ Hm-hm.

331
00:21:41,446 --> 00:21:42,849
Well ...

332
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,396
you want it?

333
00:21:49,793 --> 00:21:53,297
Two seconds.  
Time heals all wounds.

334
00:21:56,713 --> 00:22:00,696
Wait!  We'll win her back!
 We can get flowers, perfume.

335
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:04,111
She needs a new car.
  I'll pay for everything!!!

336
00:22:04,111 --> 00:22:08,195
Come on, everyone, let's celebrate! 
 Four Seasons, and it's on me.

337
00:22:08,195 --> 00:22:10,816
Oh, no.  My treat, my treat. 
/ No, Miss Fein, I'm paying.

338
00:22:10,816 --> 00:22:14,049
Oh, no.  I insist.  I'll use 
the money you gave me for the honeymoon.

339
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:17,411
Well, you didn't think you were ever
 gonna see that again, did you?

340
00:22:17,847 --> 00:22:20,571
Well, just ... consider it a bonus.
 / Thanks.

341
00:22:20,571 --> 00:22:23,709
Welcome back, Miss Fein. 
/ Thank you, Mr. Sheffield.

342
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,395
It's good to be back.
 / I just ...

343
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:30,214
I just hope you made
 the right decision.

344
00:22:30,214 --> 00:22:32,135
I did.

345
00:22:44,004 --> 00:22:44,939
Hi.

346
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:50,588
Ssh, don't say anything, but I 
just upgraded myself from coach.

347
00:22:52,127 --> 00:22:56,275
I'm Fran Fein.  What's your name? 
/ Jeff Sagansky, and this is my daughter, Gillion.

348
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:59,761
So, what do you do? 
/ I develop shows for CBS.

349
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:01,777
Ooh-ha!

350
00:23:02,543 --> 00:23:05,339
You know, I'm a nanny, 
and a lot of people tell me

351
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:08,437
that my life would make
 a great sitcom.

352
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:11,800
Stewardess, how many hours 
left on this flight?

353
00:23:12,173 --> 00:23:16,048
You see, I was workin'
 in a bridal shop in Flushing, Queens,

354
00:23:16,048 --> 00:23:19,531
till my boyfriend kicked me out
 in one of those crushing scenes.

355
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,430
Well, where was I to go?
  What was I to do?

356
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:26,105
I was out on my fanny,
 pardon my French ....
