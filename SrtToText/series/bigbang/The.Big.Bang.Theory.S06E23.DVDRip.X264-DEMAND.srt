1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,806
- Burbank Airport, please.
- Vegas, here we come!

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,567
No husbands, no boyfriends, no rules.

3
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:10,868
No rules?

4
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:14,808
We're not gonna get drunk and have
a six-way with the Blue Man Group, are we?

5
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:18,849
- No.
- So there are some rules.

6
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:22,886
Fine. No husbands, no boyfriends
and some rules.

7
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:26,684
Thank you. Vegas!

8
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:31,023
- The ladies are away, the boys will play!
- Anything can happen!

9
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:34,291
- It's gonna get crazy.
- Dungeons & Dragons!

10
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:40,366
I got a brand new bikini
so drinks at the pool are on these.

11
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,442
I got a sexy new tube top
that says "come hither"...

12
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:48,172
...and a can of pepper spray that says,
"Close enough, Jack."

13
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,750
I got some old underwear I'm gonna throw
onstage at the Garth Brooks concert.

14
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,680
I'm sorry, why old?

15
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:59,018
Because last time I saw him,
I threw new ones and it got me nothing.

16
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:04,393
I've got a brand new seven-piece
set of polyhedral dice.

17
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,895
Hello, new dice smell.

18
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,263
I've got my Helm of Lordly Might,
my Boots of Speed...

19
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,929
...and if things get too exciting,
my Inhaler of Asthma.

20
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,866
I've got my new, bloodthirsty,
Savage Warrior...

21
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:20,842
...who will lay waste
to all who stand before him.

22
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,313
And I had a sensible salad for lunch
so I can eat all the pizza I want.

23
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:28,087
Come on, are we gonna sit around
chatting like a bunch of teenage girls...

24
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,953
...or play D&D like teenage boys who will
never have sex with those teenage girls?

25
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,225
Vegas, Vegas, Vegas.

26
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,365
The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko,
Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko...

27
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,558
...the Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko.

28
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,459
I'm actually glad Lucy had to work tonight.

29
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:18,899
Saved me the awkward conversation about
how I was gonna be hanging with my bros.

30
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,840
Isn't every conversation you two
have awkward? Heh.

31
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,274
Painfully so. We have this rule on the phone
that if no one talks for three minutes...

32
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,608
...you can just hang up.

33
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,779
I'm so into her.

34
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,789
- Ready whenever you guys are.
- Yeah, we'll be right there.

35
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,182
- Leonard.
- Yeah?

36
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:43,759
I'm not sure how I feel about Howard
being Dungeon Master instead of you.

37
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,331
Aw. That's nice, but relax,
sometimes change is good.

38
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,264
You were worried about Zachary Quinto
being the new Spock...

39
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,664
...but you wound up liking him.

40
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:55,967
Please. Every time the topic of change comes
up you throw Zachary Quinto in my face.

41
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,008
I'm upset the mailman has a new haircut,
"Zachary Quinto."

42
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,315
I'm upset that daylight saving time started,
"Zachary Quinto."

43
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,849
Daylight saving time ended,
"Zachary Quinto."

44
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,850
For the last time, Zachary Quinto
was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event.

45
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,514
So stop using him against me.

46
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,821
Okay, here we go.

47
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:20,726
You find yourselves in an overgrown,
old forest.

48
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:24,926
Before you is a giant oak tree
with a face on it...

49
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,971
...that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage.

50
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,600
He says:

51
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,507
"Travel with caution...

52
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,745
These woods are home...

53
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:42,717
...to the bones
of many a fallen hero."

54
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:49,389
Now, see? Howard's just as good
a Dungeon Master as I am.

55
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:53,289
As good? You just got pantsed
in the schoolyard, four-eyes.

56
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,031
Hey, come on, guys, focus.

57
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:59,763
Um, uh, oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree.

58
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,937
We thank you for your warning,
but we are brave warriors...

59
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,771
...and nothing short of death
will keep us from our goal.

60
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,919
Oh. Lucy's free after all, see you.

61
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,785
No, no, no, hey, hey, hey,
you can't leave, we just started.

62
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,824
You're right, I should finish the game.
I take my plus-one long sword...

63
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,895
...stab myself in the face with it.
I'm dead, I've got a date with a girl. Bye.

64
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:28,991
We'll be fine. Watch.

65
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:35,596
Ahem. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from
Koothrappali's bloody corpse and says:

66
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:40,905
"Don't worry, buddies. Ghost
Raj will help guide you through the forest."

67
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:47,442
I'm just a tree,
but if I were you, I'd listen to your ghost friend.

68
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,783
Go on. Give him your lunch money.

69
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,024
I'm very happy you were able to hang out.

70
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,497
Me too.

71
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:06,365
Not that it's up to you to make me happy.
Unless you find neediness sexy...

72
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,507
...in which case you're with
the hottest man on the planet. Heh.

73
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,511
Can I tell you something?

74
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,375
I was so nervous about seeing you...

75
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:19,847
...before I left my apartment, I put roll-on
antiperspirant all over my body.

76
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,378
- Really?
- Yeah.

77
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:24,681
If sweat starts squirting out
the top of my head, you'll know why.

78
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,951
I'm sorry to put you through that.

79
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:32,191
It's okay. I'm trying to force myself
to do things that make me scared.

80
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,595
What else have you been
thinking about doing?

81
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,994
Well, let's see.

82
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,798
I'd love to be able to tell the lady
who cuts my hair that I don't like bangs.

83
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,470
- I like your bangs.
- Thanks, I like them too.

84
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,117
- What else?
- Hmm.

85
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:59,086
It's a tie between sending food back
in a restaurant...

86
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,920
...and saying no to kids
who sell magazines door to door.

87
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:03,921
Those are both toughies.

88
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,690
I know. I have a two-year subscription
to Guns and Ammo.

89
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:14,233
I push my shoulder against
the secret door to see if it gives way.

90
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,671
Uh-huh. It does.

91
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,675
He does sound effects too.

92
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,379
Hey, I always did sound effects.

93
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,918
Uh, a swarm of bloodthirsty bats
fly through the dungeon.

94
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,023
Uh, uh, they attack a nearby unicorn.

95
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,934
Okay, well, I have a sound effect
for those sound effects.

96
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,203
- Guess who?
- What are you doing back?

97
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,537
That's an excellent question. Amy?

98
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,978
Uh, well...

99
00:06:56,115 --> 00:07:00,108
...when we were going through security,
I got pulled out of line for a pat-down.

100
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,545
The, uh, TSA agent got a little handsy.

101
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,625
I may have broken her nose
with my elbow.

102
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,388
Long story short, she's on the no-fly list...

103
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,964
...and we might have been
followed here by a drone.

104
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:19,401
- I'm sorry. I feel like such an idiot.
- Oh, it's not so bad. You lost money...

105
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:24,236
...you're filled with shame, you got groped
by a stranger. That's Vegas, you nailed it.

106
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:28,807
You guys enjoy your evening. I'm gonna go
before I ruin anybody else's weekend.

107
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,347
That's my girl.

108
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,616
Amy, wait. I know it's not the night
you had in mind...

109
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,087
...but why don't you stay and play?
It'll be fun.

110
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:40,583
Fun?

111
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,092
Three weeks ago you bought
crunchy peanut butter...

112
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:46,857
...now you want the girls to play D&D
with... Do you have a drug problem?

113
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:51,134
What's the big deal? Raj bailed,
so we could use some extra players.

114
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,330
I've just never played
Dungeons & Dragons with girls before.

115
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:57,032
Oh, don't worry, sweetie. No one has.

116
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,641
So, what do you say?

117
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,783
I'll leave it up to the Dungeon Master.

118
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,320
A satanic fungus that looks suspiciously
like Al Pacino...

119
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,893
...rises from the forest floor and says:

120
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,960
"You're playing D&D...

121
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,292
...you're playing D&D...

122
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,992
...this whole apartment...

123
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,901
...is playing D&D."

124
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,815
Okay, who wants a drink?

125
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,715
Penny, we don't consume alcohol during
Dungeons & Dragons.

126
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,357
It impairs ourjudgment.

127
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:50,019
Oh, this isn't alcohol.
It's a magic potion that makes me like you.

128
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,396
Double potion, please.

129
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:57,426
Okay, here we go.

130
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:03,439
You find yourselves face to face
with two hulking ogres.

131
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,611
"What are you doing in our dungeon?"

132
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,575
"You shall die."

133
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,018
Okay, literal goosebumps. Look.

134
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,846
- What do you do?
- I draw my broadsword.

135
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,250
- I ready my quarter-staff.
- I drink my potion.

136
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,900
- I say we attack the big one.
- Give me the dice. I wanna roll.

137
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,068
The Dungeon Master's supposed to roll.

138
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,933
Yeah, well, I'm supposed to be in Vegas
throwing up on a shrimp buffet, give it.

139
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,735
- All right, what do I need?
- Uh, fifteen or higher.

140
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:44,246
Fifteen's the point. The point is 15. Give the
little lady some room. Here it is. Coming out.

141
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,711
- Sixteen! Yeah.
- Yeah.

142
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,586
Please tell me we're playing for money.

143
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,853
Oh, even better than money.
You gained experience points.

144
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,456
- More potion, please.
- Yeah.

145
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,395
- How are your crab cakes?
- Kind of funky.

146
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,333
- That's great.
- It is?

147
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,905
Does "funky" mean
something different in India?

148
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:14,504
No, no. You've always wanted to send your
food back in a restaurant. Here's your chance.

149
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,241
- That's okay. I just won't eat them.
- Don't be ridiculous. Waiter?

150
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:20,946
Everything all right?

151
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,956
Uh, yeah. Everything all right with you?

152
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,149
Yes.

153
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,990
- Okay, thanks, bye.
- Hold on.

154
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,762
Isn't there something else
you wanted to tell him?

155
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:40,636
No, it's fine. He's from a different country.
He doesn't understand our ways.

156
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,632
Don't be silly. Just tell him.

157
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:50,040
I have to go to the bathroom. And it's not
because the crab cakes are funky.

158
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,478
- So you're okay here?
- Uh, yeah, sorry. She's just a little shy.

159
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,021
The first time we met, she was so nervous...

160
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,659
...she climbed out
a bathroom window to get away.

161
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,366
Uh-oh.

162
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,547
Hey, Raj?

163
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,675
Funny story.

164
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,384
Come on, Mama wants
a pair of dead ogres.

165
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,590
Seventeen! The larger ogre is dead.

166
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,223
The other ogre says:

167
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,331
"You killed my brother."

168
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,534
"Now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined."

169
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:49,907
That is amazing.
He made me care about the ogre.

170
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,868
All right, Amy, there's one ogre left.
Take him out.

171
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,674
- Okay.
- Pretend he's that TSA agent. Come on.

172
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,551
Nineteen.

173
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,519
- This is turning out to be better than Vegas.
- Ha, ha. No, it's not.

174
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,421
Lucy?

175
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,629
Hey, long time no see.

176
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,737
You don't know me very well,
but each time you crawl out a window...

177
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,535
...to escape my company,
it chips away at my masculinity.

178
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,812
- I'm sorry.
- Why would you leave like that?

179
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,643
You were pushing me.
I didn't want to send my food back...

180
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,375
...and you tried to make me do it.

181
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,885
If I upset you,
why didn't you say something?

182
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,923
How can I tell you I'm upset
if I can't tell the woman at Supercuts...

183
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,889
...that my forehead's my best feature?

184
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:48,625
- It's scary.
- Well, I like you a lot and that's scary for me.

185
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,266
Mostly because you're a proven flight risk.

186
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,570
How could you like me a lot?

187
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:00,670
Well... For one thing, you have
bigger emotional problems than I do...

188
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,246
...and I find that very attractive in a woman.

189
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,913
I don't know, I just...

190
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,186
I think you're wonderful.

191
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,355
I'm sweating out of my head.

192
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:28,403
The dragon falls
from the sky, crashing into the volcano.

193
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,539
But wait, he's not dead.

194
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:38,149
He crawls out, spreads his wings
and prepares to attack...

195
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:39,981
Wait.

196
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,819
Doesn't he say something first?

197
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,652
Maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?

198
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:49,785
Fine.

199
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,988
"You'd think, after all these years...

200
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,333
...I'd know not to fly over volcanoes.

201
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,037
I'm a frigging idiot."

202
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:07,702
The dragon's Christopher Walken. Perfect.

203
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,008
Amy, it's your turn.
We need one more hit. Finish him off.

204
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,651
Here we go. Fifteen.

205
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,083
It's a hit, the dragon collapses to the ground.

206
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,849
Wait, wait.

207
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,015
And says...

208
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:26,194
"Mother? Is that you?

209
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,400
Your little boy is coming home."

210
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,508
I don't know about you guys, but I've been
through the emotional wringer tonight.

211
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:43,781
This may be the potion talking, but you are
one fine-ass Dungeon Master.

212
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:47,180
When we get home,
I'm gonna take you on a different adventure.

213
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,845
Another quest by Wolowitz?
Count me in.

214
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:58,026
- Sheldon, they're talking about sex.
- Oh, then I'm out.

215
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,193
Ooh, I have an idea.

216
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,960
Since it's not happening
anytime soon...

217
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,900
...why don't your character
and your character do it in the game?

218
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:09,665
Ooh!

219
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,473
- Come on, back me up here.
- Oh.

220
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,739
Ooh!

221
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,186
Okay. I cast a love spell
on Sheldon and Amy.

222
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,720
Ooh!
Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that...

223
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:31,328
The love spell takes effect.
When Sheldon looks at Amy...

224
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:35,797
...she is the most beautiful half-orc
he's ever seen...

225
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:39,927
...and he's overcome with a desire to rip
her armor off...

226
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,506
...and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts.

227
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,136
When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks...

228
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,778
...just like Sheldon
because apparently she's into that.

229
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,810
What do you do?

230
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,146
I don't like this.

231
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:09,626
You see what happens
when you let girls play D&D?

232
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,006
Amy. Amy. Amy.

233
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,339
What?

234
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,140
I've never knocked on my own door before.

235
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,013
That was a wild ride.

236
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,154
You don't have to come in here
and cheer me up.

237
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,153
Thank you.

238
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,524
Would you tell everyone else that?
Because they sure think otherwise.

239
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,827
I'll tell you what they think.

240
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,795
They think our relationship is ajoke.

241
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,973
I don't think our relationship is ajoke.

242
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:55,841
I think, "A horse goes into a bar, bartender
says, 'Why the long face?"', that's ajoke.

243
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:01,016
It's a good one too,
because a horse has a long face.

244
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,180
Sheldon...

245
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,891
...are we ever going to have
an intimate relationship?

246
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,830
Oh, my, that's an uncomfortable topic.

247
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,224
Amy...

248
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,703
Before I met you...

249
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,866
...I never had any interest in being intimate
with anyone.

250
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,334
And now?

251
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,447
And now what?

252
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,316
Do you have any interest now?

253
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,817
I have not ruled it out.

254
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:42,392
Wow. Talk dirty to me.

255
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:48,192
I know it doesn't seem like it to you,
but for me, what we have...

256
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,359
...is extremely intimate.

257
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,569
I guess I know that.

258
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,836
It's just...

259
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,407
...I think part of me wants more.

260
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,909
More?

261
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,648
Look at us. It's only been three years,
here we are in bed together.

262
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,080
Come on.

263
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,619
Let's go back out there.

264
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,954
Well, no, hold on.

265
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:23,730
My elven magic-user
and your half-orc warrior...

266
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,927
...did have a love spell cast on them.

267
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:31,274
We wouldn't really be playing the game right
if we didn't see that through.

268
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,646
Okay.

269
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:41,616
I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon.

270
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,352
While the others pillage the corpse...

271
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:50,427
...I lead you to a secluded area...

272
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:55,430
...where I attempt to remove
your leather armor.

273
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,106
- It comes off.
- Oh.

274
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,668
What do you do?

275
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,479
I...

276
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,509
...kiss you on the lips.

277
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,418
I kiss you back on the...

278
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,956
...lips as well.

279
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,963
Your turn.

280
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,737
I remove your armor.

281
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,301
What do you do?

282
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,635
I erotically caress your...

283
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,882
...nose.
- Keep rolling.

284
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,691
Hey, you guys have been in there a while.
You doing okay?

285
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,389
We're fine, thank you.

286
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,401
- Okay, we just want to say we feel bad...
- Go away! Sheldon is nibbling on my...

287
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,899
Fourteen! Yes!
