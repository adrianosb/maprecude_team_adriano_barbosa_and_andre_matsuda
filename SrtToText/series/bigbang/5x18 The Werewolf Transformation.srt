1
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:07,214
I'm gonna run to the store.
I'll pick you up when you're done.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,968
Okay. I like it a little better
when you stay, but all right.

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,803
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Hello.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,347
I'm here for my haircut
with Mr. D'Onofrio.

5
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,517
I'm sorry, Uncle Tony is in the hospital.
He's pretty sick.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,396
Oh, dear, Mr. D'Onofrio's
in the hospital.

7
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:25,691
Why do these things
always happen to me?

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,610
- I can cut it for you.
- You're not Mr. D'Onofrio.

9
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,739
I get my hair cut by Mr. D'Onofrio.

10
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,991
You believe this guy?

11
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,285
Excuse us for a second.

12
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,871
Sheldon, it's okay, he can do it.
He's a barber.

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,707
He's not a barber, he's the nephew.

14
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,043
An example of the nepotism...

15
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,503
...that runs rampant
in the barbering industry.

16
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,299
Besides Mr. D'Onofrio knows exactly
how I like my hair done...

17
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:53,886
...because he has all my haircut records
from my barber in Texas.

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,013
What are you talking about?

19
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,475
When I first moved here, I was nervous
about finding a new barber...

20
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:03,395
...so my mother had all my haircut
records sent here to Mr. D'Onofrio.

21
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,025
There's no such thing
as haircut records.

22
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:12,112
- Yes, there are.
- Have you ever seen them?

23
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,740
No, but my mother assured me
they were sent here...

24
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:18,619
...and I'll bet you dollars to donuts
that this one doesn't have them.

25
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:19,953
Excuse me.

26
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,498
Do you have access
to my haircut records?

27
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,083
Your what?

28
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,377
To paraphrase T.S. Eliot,
this is the way the world ends.

29
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,672
Not with a bang but with a nephew.

30
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,635
Sheldon, you're a grown man,
he's a professional...

31
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:38,639
...and your haircut is number three
on that poster from 1946.

32
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,101
- Just sit down and let him do it.
- Fine.

33
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,896
But if I come out of this
looking like a dork, it's on you.

34
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,406
- So my kid said the funniest thing today.
- Nope.

35
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:06,542
When you tell this story later,
the word we usually use is "quirky."

36
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,237
- Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?
- Sure.

37
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,874
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to get the hair out of my eyes.

38
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,878
Sheldon, you are one day late
for your haircut.

39
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,380
Thank you
for captioning my nightmare.

40
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:57,927
- Lookie here, I got my travel orders.
- Hmm.

41
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,347
"Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz
is requested to report...

42
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:04,559
...to the NASA Johnson Space Center,
Houston, Texas...

43
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,769
...for astronaut training
Monday 8 a.m."

44
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,898
Yeah, but it's from NASA,
so it's 0800.

45
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,274
But it says 8 a.m.

46
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:17,238
- You read it as 0800.
- Itdoesn't have an O in front of it.

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,991
It does have an O in front of it.

48
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:23,703
Oh, my God, I'm an astronaut,
and you're dying of jealousy.

49
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:28,416
So, what kind of things are they...?
Will you stop that?

50
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,921
I can't help it,
I feel like a teen heartthrob.

51
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,592
Sheldon, I used to cut my brother's hair.
I could do it.

52
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:43,431
Penny, I know you mean well,
offering the skills of the hill folk...

53
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,018
...but here in town,
we don't churn our own butter...

54
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:49,354
...we don't make dresses
out of gunny sacks...

55
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,815
...and we sure as shooting
don't get our hair cut by bottle-blond...

56
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,734
Sheldon, be nice.

57
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:59,656
I'm sorry, it's the bad-boy attitude
that comes with this hair.

58
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,370
You could go to my guy.
He's at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills.

59
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,830
They bring you a cup of tea,
massage your scalp.

60
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,500
It's $200 but sometimes
you look in the next chair...

61
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,711
...and you see a superstar
like Tony Danza.

62
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,258
Quick question here, have we actually
changed the conversation...

63
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:22,220
...from "I'm going to astronaut training"
to "Sheldon can't get a haircut"?

64
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:26,557
Now who's dying of jealousy?
"Oh," it's you.

65
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:32,438
I'm a cowboy

66
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,400
On a steel horse
I ride

67
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:42,907
I'm wanted

68
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,913
Wanted
Dead or alive

69
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:53,042
Sheldon, you're ruining
girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night.

70
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:57,422
I'm sorry. I'm looking for a barber
and I'm running out of time.

71
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,673
My hair is growing...

72
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,510
...at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers
per femtosecond.

73
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:06,347
If you're quiet, you can hear it.

74
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,101
- What about Supercuts?
- No, I tried once.

75
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:13,938
They do men's and women's hair
in the same room at the same time.

76
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,899
It's like Sodom and Gomorrah
with mousse.

77
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:21,904
Well, this isn't a crisis. Why don't
you just let your hair grow out a little?

78
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,240
Why don't I let my hair grow out?

79
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,367
Why don't I start wearing
Birkenstocks...

80
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:30,997
...and seeking validation of my opinions
by asking, "Can you dig it?"

81
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,668
I don't know. I think
you might look sexy with long hair.

82
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,840
With the kind
that flows down to your shoulders...

83
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,134
...and blows back
while riding on a horse.

84
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,514
Bareback and bare-chested.

85
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,852
I'm gonna go brush my teeth,
it might take a while.

86
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,777
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.

87
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,446
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

88
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,948
So tell me all about your first day.

89
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:11,788
Oh, wow, where do I even start?
I got to experience zero gravity.

90
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,040
- Cool. How do they do that?
- It's pretty neat.

91
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:19,379
You get in this plane that goes
almost straight up for like 20 seconds...

92
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:23,966
...and then straight back down
like it's gonna crash...

93
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:29,430
...and they do it over and over again,
no matter how many times you throw up.

94
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,559
- You threw up?
- Yeah. And the craziest part is...

95
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:38,856
...because there's no gravity,
the throw-up kind of floats there.

96
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:43,945
In a little ball,
and if your mouth is open...

97
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,406
...because you're screaming...

98
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:51,786
...sometimes it just floats right back in.

99
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,041
Boy, does everyone laugh at you
when that happens.

100
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,043
- That sounds mean.
- No.

101
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,753
I would have laughed too...

102
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,797
...but I didn't want
the vomit to come back out.

103
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,802
Heh. Anyway...

104
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,679
Oh, could you do me a favor...

105
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:13,015
...and overnight me
some more underwear?

106
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,351
- Sure, why?
- I got a look at the centrifuge...

107
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,687
...they're gonna
spin me around in tomorrow...

108
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:21,190
...and I have a hunch
I packed a little light.

109
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,533
Mr. D'Onofrio?

110
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,118
It's me, Sheldon.

111
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:36,873
They didn't have anything
barber-themed in the gift shop...

112
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,083
...so I got you this.

113
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:43,713
Don't know if you can read his little
T-shirt. It says, "Get well beary soon."

114
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:48,676
Trust me, if you were even a little
conscious right now, you'd be laughing.

115
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,348
Anyway...

116
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,477
There's new studies that show...

117
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:01,939
...people in comas are aware
of everything going on around them.

118
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,859
With that in mind, if you can hear me...

119
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:10,615
...move away from the light
and toward the sound of these scissors.

120
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,619
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

121
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,206
Do you have something
I could use as a cape?

122
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,585
Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills,
slip out of the ninth floor...

123
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,795
...and go on a little adventure?

124
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:30,134
Oh, no, I'm just here
to get my hair cut.

125
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:37,558
I see. Just wait here one moment.

126
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,602
Security!

127
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:46,025
I gotta run. But not with scissors.
That would be unsafe.

128
00:08:49,948 --> 00:08:54,243
So if I move my horsey here...

129
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:58,456
...isn't that checkmate and I win?

130
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:06,797
Hmm.

131
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,218
Oh... Is it or isn't it?

132
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:14,180
You know, I think
this is a good stopping point.

133
00:09:16,016 --> 00:09:20,269
It's your first real game.
I threw a lot of information at you.

134
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:21,645
No, your king is trapped.

135
00:09:21,855 --> 00:09:24,565
He can't go here
because of my lighthouse...

136
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:26,442
...and...

137
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:31,614
...he can't go here
because of my pointy-head guy.

138
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:35,117
Like I said, complicated game.

139
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:37,953
- So did I win or not?
- Did you have fun?

140
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:40,289
Because if you had fun,
then you are a winner.

141
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:42,583
That's what chess is all about.

142
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:45,669
- Hello.
- Hey.

143
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,838
Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I'll move.

144
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:51,509
Why? My spot, your spot.
What difference does it make?

145
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:59,100
- Okay, what just happened?
- I don't know.

146
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:01,519
Between you playing chess
like Bobby Fischer...

147
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:04,146
...and Sheldon being okay
with you in his spot...

148
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:06,440
...I'm guessing
someone went back in time...

149
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,652
...stepped on a bug,
and changed the course of human events.

150
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:14,949
- Sweetie, are you all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

151
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:17,952
It's been six days
since I was supposed to get a haircut...

152
00:10:18,161 --> 00:10:19,995
...and nothing horrible has happened.

153
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:23,082
Okay, I'm sorry, I don't understand.

154
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:27,670
- Leonard, explain it to her.
- Oh, uh, he's crazy.

155
00:10:29,548 --> 00:10:33,008
I have spent my whole life
trying to bring order to the universe...

156
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:35,845
...by carefully planning
every moment of every day.

157
00:10:36,054 --> 00:10:39,557
But all my efforts, our dinner schedule,
my pajama rotation...

158
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,725
...my bowel movement spreadsheet...

159
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:46,063
it's clear now,
I've been wasting my time.

160
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:50,276
Good. I'm taking that disgusting chart
off the fridge.

161
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:52,278
You know...

162
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:54,780
...sometimes it's nice
not knowing what's coming.

163
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,073
Look at me and Leonard.

164
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:57,992
We went out, broke up,
trying again.

165
00:10:58,201 --> 00:10:59,618
We don't know what's gonna happen.

166
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:02,288
Oh, please, everyone knows
what's going to happen.

167
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:06,083
But I see your point.

168
00:11:06,293 --> 00:11:07,918
I think this could be good for you.

169
00:11:08,128 --> 00:11:11,297
Maybe it's time for you
to shake things up a bit.

170
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:12,840
You're right.

171
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:14,717
I should embrace the chaos.

172
00:11:16,136 --> 00:11:19,054
- Great. What are you gonna do first?
- I don't know.

173
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:22,975
I could do anything. All bets are off.

174
00:11:23,185 --> 00:11:25,895
The world is my oyster.

175
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:28,063
I got it.

176
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:30,482
I'm gonna put on
my Tuesday pajamas tonight.

177
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:37,740
I got to tell you,
I'm a little worried about him.

178
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:39,450
If I were you, I'd be worried...

179
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:43,204
...that a girl who's never played chess
in her life just kicked your ass.

180
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:57,760
Hi.

181
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,471
Howie, what happened to you?

182
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,850
We did overnight survival training
in the wilderness.

183
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:08,812
Big fun. Big, big fun.

184
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:11,523
I was gonna freshen up for you...

185
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:16,570
...but I blacked out a little
on the way to the bathroom.

186
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:19,281
Survival training?
Is that like camping?

187
00:12:19,491 --> 00:12:23,827
Uh-huh. Except you don't have food
or water...

188
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:26,747
...and they don't have
a sunset Sabbath service...

189
00:12:26,957 --> 00:12:29,625
...like they do at Camp Hess Kramer.

190
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:33,295
- Do you sleep in tents?
- No.

191
00:12:33,505 --> 00:12:40,511
I slept in a hole I dug in the ground
with my bare hands.

192
00:12:41,263 --> 00:12:46,809
And at some point during the night,
an armadillo crawled in...

193
00:12:47,978 --> 00:12:50,229
...and spooned me.

194
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,776
- Poor baby.
- But I did it. I survived.

195
00:12:55,986 --> 00:13:00,447
I wasn't sure
I was going to when the sandstorm hit.

196
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:07,329
I just pulled my turtleneck up
over my head and waited for death.

197
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:11,959
But somehow as I sat there...

198
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:16,255
...wrapped in a cocoon
of my own neck-sweat...

199
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,551
...I found that primal part
of the human spirit...

200
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:27,433
...that just wants to keep on living,
heh-heh, no matter what the cost.

201
00:13:27,642 --> 00:13:30,477
You're so brave. I'm proud of you.

202
00:13:31,021 --> 00:13:33,439
I ate a butterfly.

203
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:43,282
It was so small...

204
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:46,535
...beautiful...

205
00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:50,080
...but I was so hungry.

206
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:56,920
- Are you crying?
- No, I don't think it's possible.

207
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,215
I'm severely dehydrated.

208
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:03,969
My pee is like toothpaste.

209
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:08,140
Howie, if you're not able to do this,
come home.

210
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,101
It won't change how I feel about you.

211
00:14:11,311 --> 00:14:14,688
Thanks, honey, but I can't quit.

212
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:17,149
If I do, I'd just be a guy...

213
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:21,278
...who had a chance to be an astronaut
and gave it up.

214
00:14:21,488 --> 00:14:23,489
Is there anything I could do to help?

215
00:14:24,032 --> 00:14:25,574
No.

216
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:29,036
Wait. Send more underwear.

217
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:43,592
Don't let this be
Sheldon playing bongos.

218
00:14:47,347 --> 00:14:51,350
Please, don't let this be
Sheldon playing bongos.

219
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:01,652
Hello, Leonard,
Do you like my bongos?

220
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:07,032
Bet you didn't know that I had bongos

221
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:10,202
Sheldon, it's 3:00 in the morning.

222
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:14,456
Three in the morning
Is a good time for bongos

223
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,333
I was sleeping.

224
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:20,671
Leonard sleeps while I play bongos

225
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,006
No, he doesn't.

226
00:15:23,216 --> 00:15:26,009
Leonard no sleep while I play bongos

227
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:27,719
Bongo solo.

228
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,852
Stop. Stop it. Stop. Stop.

229
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:36,937
Stop it.

230
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:44,027
- What the hell?
- Oh, hi, Penny, guess what?

231
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:46,405
Sheldon got bongos.

232
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:49,908
- Why did you get bongos?
- Richard Feynman played the bongos.

233
00:15:50,118 --> 00:15:51,326
I thought I'd try.

234
00:15:51,536 --> 00:15:53,120
Feynman was a famous physicist.

235
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:54,496
It's 3:00 in the morning.

236
00:15:54,706 --> 00:15:58,459
I don't care if Richard Feynman was a
purple leprechaun who lived in my butt.

237
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:02,629
Penny meant
If he were a purple leprechaun

238
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:06,800
Penny forgot to use the subjunctive

239
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,096
Sheldon, go to bed.
You have work in the morning.

240
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:16,101
Maybe, maybe not. Maybe tomorrow
I start a bongo band and tour the world.

241
00:16:17,562 --> 00:16:21,273
No, hang on. Roommate Agreement.

242
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:26,487
No hootenannies, sing-a-longs,
or barbershop quartets after 10 p.m.

243
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:28,739
Roommate Agreement?
Are you kidding?

244
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:32,284
We are living in a world of chaos.

245
00:16:32,494 --> 00:16:33,911
Roommate Agreement.

246
00:16:36,331 --> 00:16:40,209
- Where are you going?
- Wherever the music takes me, kitten.

247
00:16:43,296 --> 00:16:46,965
I play bongos walking down the stairs

248
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:48,759
Oh! Oh!

249
00:16:51,346 --> 00:16:54,973
Never play bongos
Walking down the stairs

250
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:03,899
- Surprise.
- What are you doing here?

251
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:05,734
Here to help you get through this.

252
00:17:05,944 --> 00:17:09,029
Can't do it on your own,
you need someone to take care of you.

253
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:12,324
- Oh. I love you so much.
- Oh, and I love you.

254
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:16,537
Howard, your bath is getting cold.

255
00:17:17,997 --> 00:17:22,084
Don't worry, once she falls asleep,
I'll spoon you like an armadillo. Heh.

256
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:30,592
He showed up in the middle of the night
with his bongos.

257
00:17:30,802 --> 00:17:34,346
I foolishly thought
it was some sort of musical booty call.

258
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:40,102
Poor guy.
He must have been exhausted.

259
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:42,980
Sheldon like to sleep
While Leonard play the bongo

260
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:49,194
- That was kind of uncalled for.
- No, it was called for.

261
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,072
What's going on?

262
00:17:52,282 --> 00:17:54,575
Sheldon, this craziness has gone
on long enough.

263
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:56,827
Please come home
so I can cut your hair.

264
00:17:57,412 --> 00:18:00,372
Penny, you're not trained.
You're not licensed.

265
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:04,459
And most importantly, you don't have
access to my haircut records.

266
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:09,423
All right, honey, look...

267
00:18:09,632 --> 00:18:12,551
...we've known each other
for a long time now, right?

268
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,430
I've taken you to Disneyland,
I kicked a bully in the nuts for you.

269
00:18:17,557 --> 00:18:22,019
I sing you "Soft Kitty" when you're sick,
you've even seen me naked once.

270
00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:24,313
I'm sorry, what?

271
00:18:25,857 --> 00:18:29,151
It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon,
I promise I know what I'm doing.

272
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,944
Please let me cut your hair.

273
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:33,989
Amy, what do you think?

274
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:38,827
There's not a hair on my body
I wouldn't let this woman trim.

275
00:18:46,336 --> 00:18:48,128
Fine, let's go.

276
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:54,009
Thank you for letting me sleep
on your couch.

277
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:57,679
There's only so many times a woman
can say, "How about the bed?"

278
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:02,559
What's this about
Sheldon seeing you naked?

279
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:06,897
Oh, relax.
It was just her bottom and her breasts.

280
00:19:12,488 --> 00:19:14,531
Almost done.

281
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:19,369
At the end of the haircut,
Mr. D'Onofrio would tell me a dirty joke.

282
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:22,998
Oh, sorry, I don't know any dirty jokes.

283
00:19:23,207 --> 00:19:26,168
That's okay,
I never understood them anyway.

284
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:30,714
Okay, what do you think?

285
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:37,846
Hmm. Well, it's a little Hollywood.

286
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:42,767
But I think I can pull it off.
Well done, Penny.

287
00:19:42,977 --> 00:19:45,478
Told you. I'm just gonna
clean up your neck a little...

288
00:19:45,688 --> 00:19:47,397
- ...and then you are good to go.
- Fun time.

289
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:52,819
Sorry,
sometimes the clippers tickle me.

290
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:54,529
Okay.

291
00:20:01,829 --> 00:20:04,915
Okay, yep, we're all done now.
It's... it's good.

292
00:20:05,124 --> 00:20:07,876
Let me just take that away from you.
Okay.

293
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:11,213
- Thank you very much.
- You are welcome.

294
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:17,344
Okay.

295
00:20:20,473 --> 00:20:21,890
Yeah, I'm gonna have to move. Ahem.
