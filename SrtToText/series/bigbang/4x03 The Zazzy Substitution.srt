1
00:00:03,412 --> 00:00:06,040
All right.
I'm ready for my next question.

2
00:00:06,682 --> 00:00:09,549
In a world where rhinoceroses
are domesticated pets...

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,516
...who wins the Second World War?

4
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:16,991
- Uganda.
- Defend.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,220
Kenya rises to power
on the export of rhinoceroses.

6
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:24,423
A central African power block is formed
colonizing North Africa and Europe.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,899
When war breaks out,
no one can afford the luxury of a rhino.

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,334
Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs.

9
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:34,804
Correct. My turn.

10
00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:41,007
In a world where a piano is a weapon,
not a musical instrument...

11
00:00:41,184 --> 00:00:44,745
...on what does Scott Joplin
play the "Maple Leaf Rag."

12
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:48,617
- Tuned bayonets.
- Defend.

13
00:00:48,824 --> 00:00:51,952
- Isn't it obvious?
- You're right, my apologies.

14
00:00:54,697 --> 00:00:57,222
What the hell are you guys playing?

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,733
It's a game we invented.
It's called Counterfactuals.

16
00:01:00,903 --> 00:01:04,304
We postulate an alternate world
that differs from ours in one aspect...

17
00:01:04,473 --> 00:01:09,274
...then pose questions to each other.
- It's fun for ages 8 to 80. Join us.

18
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:13,374
All right. I like a good brainteaser.
I'll give it a whirl.

19
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:15,278
You're in luck. This is an easy one.

20
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:20,787
In a world where mankind is ruled
by a giant intelligent beaver...

21
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:23,585
...what food is no longer consumed.

22
00:01:24,427 --> 00:01:25,758
Uh...

23
00:01:25,928 --> 00:01:29,557
A BLT where the B stands for beaver?
I don't know.

24
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:33,391
Leonard, be serious.
We're playing a game here.

25
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,597
Ahem, I can figure this out. Let's see.

26
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:36,795
Um...

27
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:39,271
Well, beavers eat tree bark.

28
00:01:39,442 --> 00:01:42,502
The only tree bark I know
that humans consume is cinnamon.

29
00:01:42,678 --> 00:01:44,839
- So I'll say cinnamon.
- Incorrect.

30
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:48,472
Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish.

31
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:52,784
- What?
- In a world ruled by a giant beaver...

32
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:56,015
...mankind builds many dams
to please the beaver overlord.

33
00:01:56,192 --> 00:01:59,525
The low-lying city of Copenhagen
is flooded, thousands die...

34
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:03,756
...devastated, the Danes never invent
their namesake pastry.

35
00:02:06,702 --> 00:02:09,000
How does one miss that?

36
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:12,831
This is ridiculous.
You're just making stuff up.

37
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,172
Is he always like this when he loses?

38
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:20,281
Oh, yes. You should have been here
for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008.

39
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:24,349
You bumped the table
and you know it.

40
00:02:28,624 --> 00:02:32,492
Perhaps it would be kinder to play
a game more suited to his abilities.

41
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:36,359
We'll close our eyes and count to ten
while you hide.

42
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,324
I'm going to my room.

43
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:42,301
Very good, Leonard. But next time,
don't tell us where you're hiding.

44
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:14,264
See the paper in The American
Physics Journal on supersolids?

45
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:16,735
This guy's working
from a hypothesis where...

46
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:19,568
- Spoiler alert, spoiler alert.
- What?

47
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:23,337
Don't ruin it for me, man.
I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.

48
00:03:23,512 --> 00:03:25,503
On the potty? What are you, 5?

49
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:27,808
- It's a potty. What do you call it?
- Toilet.

50
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:30,611
A little vulgar for the dinner table,
don't you think?

51
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:32,754
Oh, and potty is okay?

52
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:34,822
Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.

53
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,525
What do you do in the potty,
wee-wee?

54
00:03:38,327 --> 00:03:40,921
If I don't have to boom-boom.

55
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:42,121
Greetings.

56
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:45,028
- Uh, you all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.
LEONARD: Sure, hi.

57
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:46,793
- Hello.
- Sorry we're late.

58
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,995
I must take responsibility. I had to stop
for feminine hygiene supplies.

59
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:51,605
LEONARD: Ah!
HOWARD: Okay.

60
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:53,537
I believe she's experiencing her menses.

61
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,608
Actually, I'm not.
In order to avoid surprises...

62
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,679
...I wear them all the time.
HOWARD: Okay.

63
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:02,144
Toilet's sounding
pretty good now, huh?

64
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,712
Hey, look, it's Shamy.

65
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:09,982
- Shamy?
- A juvenile amalgamation of our names.

66
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,787
Sheldon, Amy. Shamy.

67
00:04:13,162 --> 00:04:14,186
Oh.

68
00:04:14,363 --> 00:04:16,126
I don't like that. Don't do that.

69
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:19,360
Heh. Alrighty. What's new?

70
00:04:19,535 --> 00:04:23,027
Recently, I learned that you refer to us
as Shamy and I don't like that.

71
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:27,741
I got it. But what I was going for was,
you know, how's your life?

72
00:04:27,943 --> 00:04:29,376
Like everybody else's.

73
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:32,480
Subject to entropy,
decay and eventual death.

Thank you for asking.
Why is she not taking our order?

75
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:38,413
I should have warned you.

76
00:04:38,587 --> 00:04:41,522
One has to navigate
a labyrinth of social nonsense...

77
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,487
...before one can be fed here.

78
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:47,320
I assumed that an establishment
called the Cheesecake Factory...

79
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,327
...would function more efficiently.

80
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,695
It's how they lure you in.
I believe it's called "bait and switch."

81
00:04:53,903 --> 00:04:57,669
Okay, I'm just gonna walk away
because I don't wanna be here.

[RAJESH SIGHS]

we've all gotten together to eat.

- I doubt you'd understand.

Sheldon tells me
you only have a Master's degree.

Raj? Do you have
any questions for Amy?

we're not eating alone.

She's not my girlfriend.

She's a girl and she's my friend...

It was an action
we both regret to this day.

Uh-huh. Anyway. I'm not sure
she's the best fit...

Okay, let me just get right to it.

and frankly, just obnoxious.

So we already have you for all that.

I terminate my relationship with Amy?

No, no, of course not. Just have
your relationship someplace else.

...I suffered in silence
as your female companion...

country music caterwauling...

155
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,944
- No, trust me.
- No.

156
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:08,112
I do this for my Mom all the time.

157
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:13,522
See? With the grain.

158
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,227
Wow, that is better.

159
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,158
And someday,
when you have varicose veins...

160
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:21,768
...I'll show you
how to massage them.

161
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,870
Oh, God, never again.

162
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:31,479
I assume you mean never again
will you drink all of Penny's beer...

163
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,138
...run to the gas station
for a couple of 40s...

164
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:38,548
...a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue
of Bombay Badonkadonks.

165
00:09:40,255 --> 00:09:42,155
I was homesick.

166
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:44,522
The highlight
was when you showed us...

167
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:46,354
...your Bollywood
break-dancing skills.

[HUMMING]

169
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:58,500
- That's very offensive.
- Yeah, we all thought so.

170
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:01,805
LEONARD: Oh, no.
- What?

171
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:04,070
John and Yoko.

172
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:06,981
More like Yoko and Yoko.

173
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,377
- Greetings.
LEONARD: Hey.

174
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,145
I brought Amy here
to show her some of the work I'm doing.

175
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:15,381
It's very impressive.
For theoretical work.

176
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:18,657
Do I detect a hint of condescension?

177
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,590
I'm sorry, was I being too subtle?

178
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:24,860
I meant compared to the real-world
applications of neurobiology...

179
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:28,491
...theoretical physics is... What's the word
I'm looking for? Hmm, cute.

180
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,501
ALL:
Oh.

181
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:35,234
Are you suggesting the work
of a neurobiologist like Babinski...

182
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,106
...could ever rise to the significance
of a physicist...

183
00:10:38,313 --> 00:10:40,873
...like Clerk Maxwell or Dirac?

184
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,539
I'm stating it outright.

185
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:47,314
Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast
and defecates Clerk Maxwell.

186
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,320
You take that back.

187
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:56,264
Absolutely not. My colleagues and I
map the neurological substrates...

188
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:58,763
...that subserve
global information processing...

189
00:10:58,934 --> 00:11:02,631
...which is required for cognitive
reasoning, including scientific inquiry...

190
00:11:02,838 --> 00:11:05,932
...making my research, ipso facto,
prior in the ordo cognoscendi.

191
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,405
That means it's better than his research,
and by extension, of course, yours.

192
00:11:13,982 --> 00:11:16,041
I'm sorry, I'm still trying to work...

193
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:19,483
...on the "defecating
Clerk Maxwell." So...

194
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:26,292
Excuse me, but a grand unified theory,
insofar as it explains everything...

195
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:29,897
...will, ipso facto,
explain neurobiology.

196
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:33,501
But if successful, I will map
and reproduce your thought processes...

197
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:35,637
...in deriving a grand unified theory.

198
00:11:35,804 --> 00:11:38,739
And therefore, subsume your conclusions
under my paradigm.

199
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,774
That's the rankest psychologism...

200
00:11:41,944 --> 00:11:44,105
...and was conclusively revealed
as hogwash...

201

...by Gottlob Frege
in the 1890s.

- We appear to have reached an impasse.
- I agree.

203
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,183
I move our relationship

00:11:56,191 --> 00:11:58,421
- Seconded.
- There being no objections?

ALL:
No. Uh-uh.

206
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,457
The motion carries.

207
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:06,533
- Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.
- Good day, Sheldon Cooper.

208
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:12,766
Women, huh?

209
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:17,708
Can't live with them, can't successfully
refute their hypotheses.

210
00:12:17,913 --> 00:12:19,676
Amen to that.

211
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:29,351
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Hello.

212
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:33,823
I hear you broke up with Amy.

213
00:12:33,996 --> 00:12:36,760
A breakup would imply
she was my girlfriend.

214
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:42,370
She was a girl who was my friend
who is now a girl who is not my friend.

215
00:12:42,537 --> 00:12:45,700
Wow, that's, like,
the worst country song ever.

216
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,202
So how are you doing?

217
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:52,711
- Regarding what?
- Amy.

218
00:12:53,348 --> 00:12:54,906
I don't follow.

219
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,448
Well, breakups...

220
00:12:56,652 --> 00:13:00,110
...or whatever the hell this is,
can be tough.

221
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:02,257
Penny, I assure you, I'm fine.

222
00:13:02,424 --> 00:13:05,450
My relationship with Amy
was purely intellectual.

223
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:07,253
There were no emotional bonds...

224
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:10,091
...the severing of which
would cause me any discomfort.

225
00:13:10,265 --> 00:13:12,699
The relationship simply outlived
its utility...

226
00:13:12,868 --> 00:13:15,701
...and I'm continuing on
with my life as before.

227
00:13:16,405 --> 00:13:17,702
Okay. Good.

228
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:21,240
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm off to buy a pussycat.

229
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:26,939
I gotta tell you guys,
I'm a little worried about Sheldon.

230
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:29,777
We're all a little worried
about Sheldon.

231
00:13:29,952 --> 00:13:32,785
No. I mean, since the Shamy
hit a reef.

232
00:13:32,955 --> 00:13:34,980
Oh, I thought you were
making a generalization.

233
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,785
I'm worried about Sheldon someday
setting off a low-yield nuclear device...

234
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:41,259
...because the cafeteria
ran out of lime Jell-O.

235
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:45,266
- What does "hit a reef" mean?
- Uh, went splitsville.

236
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:48,895
- Pardon?
- Turned to boom-boom.

237
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:50,736
Ah.

238
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:53,240
I think Sheldon really misses Amy.

239
00:13:53,442 --> 00:13:57,435
You should lend him your copy
of Bombay Badonkadonks.

240
00:13:58,013 --> 00:14:00,573
- He got a cat to keep him company.
- You're kidding.

241
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:03,650
He takes it everywhere.
To bed, to the bathroom.

242
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:05,616
He takes the kitty to the potty?

243
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:08,283
I thought we discussed the P-word.

244
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:11,790
Don't try to change me, dude.
I am what I am.

245
00:14:12,527 --> 00:14:13,926
- Oh, gentlemen.

HOWARD:
Oh, ho, ho.

247
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:18,859
Aren't you gonna introduce us
to your little friend?

248
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:24,939
My apologies. Raj, Howard, I'd like you
to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

249
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:28,367
- Hello.
- Hi.

250
00:14:28,543 --> 00:14:31,341
Now, if you'll excuse me,
the father of the atomic bomb...

251
00:14:31,513 --> 00:14:32,980
...wants a saucer of milk.

252
00:14:35,183 --> 00:14:37,310
Okay, I get it.
We're worried about Sheldon.

253
00:14:37,486 --> 00:14:38,612
Yeah.

254
00:14:42,024 --> 00:14:45,323
Hey. Oh, no.

255
00:14:45,994 --> 00:14:48,827
Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.

256
00:14:48,997 --> 00:14:52,330
So you decided to get
the whole Manhattan Project?

257
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:55,698
Yes. This is Enrico Fermi,
Richard Feynman...

258
00:14:55,871 --> 00:14:57,668
...Edward Teller, Otto Frisch.

259
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,707
- Zazzles.
- Zazzles?

260
00:15:01,877 --> 00:15:04,175
I was going to name him
Hermann von Helmholtz...

261
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:06,837
...but he's so zazzy.

262
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:13,485
- Okay, we need to talk.
- About what?

263
00:15:13,655 --> 00:15:15,054
Cats, Sheldon.

264
00:15:15,223 --> 00:15:17,316
You're clearly upset
about Amy being gone...

265
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:19,858
...and you're trying to replace her
with cats.

266
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:21,495
- Clowder.
- What?

267
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:24,894
- Group of cats is a clowder or a glaring.
- Okay, yeah...

268
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:29,197
It's the kind of thing you ought to know
now that we have one.

269
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:34,606
Terrific. My point is, you need to face up
to what you're feeling with this breakup.

270
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,608
It wasn't a breakup. A breakup
would imply that Amy was...

271
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,077
Okay, I got it.
She's not your girlfriend.

272
00:15:40,248 --> 00:15:44,207
Now, listen to me.
I know about loneliness.

273
00:15:44,386 --> 00:15:47,082
I know about trying
to replace someone with other stuff.

274
00:15:47,255 --> 00:15:50,247
When I broke up with Penny,
I got back into my cello...

275
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:52,393
...built a bunch of model rockets.

276
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:56,463
I got those weightlifting gloves
and that five-pound dumbbell.

277
00:15:57,766 --> 00:16:00,257
You didn't break up, she dumped you.

278
00:16:00,435 --> 00:16:03,598
She didn't dump me. It was mutual.

279
00:16:03,772 --> 00:16:06,605
- I was there. She dumped you.
- Okay, fine.

280
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:09,767
Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy.
She had dozens of them.

281
00:16:09,945 --> 00:16:13,073
And you know what happened
after she died? They ate her.

282
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:16,742
You don't have to sell me on cats,
Leonard. I'm already a fan.

All right, fellas,
who's in the mood for Fancy Feast?

284
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:29,158
Well, that's not fancy at all.

285
00:16:33,502 --> 00:16:35,163
Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.

286
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,997
- Where is he?
- He's in his bedroom.

287
00:16:37,172 --> 00:16:40,073
Now, when you said on the phone
"he broke up with a girl"...

288
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:42,107
...you meant an actual girl...

289
00:16:42,277 --> 00:16:44,939
...not something
you kids whipped up in a lab?

290
00:16:45,747 --> 00:16:48,614
- No, she's real.
- Did they sin?

291
00:16:48,783 --> 00:16:52,150
No, no. It's not like that. It's, uh...

292
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:54,480
I don't know it's like.

293
00:16:54,656 --> 00:16:56,749
There is something
I should prepare you for.

294
00:16:56,925 --> 00:17:00,122
Oh, relax, Leonard,
I have raised that boy.

295
00:17:00,295 --> 00:17:02,627
I've seen him at his best,
seen him at his worst.

296
00:17:02,797 --> 00:17:05,129
There's nothing he can do
that'll surprise me.

297
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,759
Hold on to that thought.

298
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:09,801

Come in.

[CATS MEOWING]

300
00:17:14,176 --> 00:17:15,803
Surprise.

301
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:18,605
Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.

302
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,511
My, my, that's a powerful smell.

303

I'd like you to meet Oppenheimer,
Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf...

304
00:17:28,456 --> 00:17:30,390
Yeah, I get it. You got a lot of cats...

305
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,119
...and you gave them
cute Jewish names.

306
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:36,491
- What are you doing here?
- Leonard called.

00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:39,498
He said that you were pining
for a young lady.

308
00:17:39,668 --> 00:17:43,468
Oh, that's preposterous.
I'm not pining over anyone.

309
00:17:43,638 --> 00:17:45,970
Oh, lamb chop,
we can quibble what to call it...

310
00:17:46,141 --> 00:17:49,542
...but I think
we can both agree it's creepy.

311
00:17:50,178 --> 00:17:51,839
I do not agree.

312
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:54,208
Cats make wonderful companions.

313
00:17:54,382 --> 00:17:58,512
They don't argue
or question my intellectual authority.

314
00:17:58,687 --> 00:18:04,648
And this little guy here,
I think you'll find to be quite zazzy.

315
00:18:06,228 --> 00:18:08,492
- You should have called sooner.
- Yeah.

316
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:11,999
Shelly. Dinner's ready.

317
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:13,930
SHELDON: Coming.
- No cats.

318
00:18:14,102 --> 00:18:15,592
SHLEDON:
Aw.

319
00:18:19,874 --> 00:18:22,570
- What is she doing here?
- I called her.

320
00:18:22,744 --> 00:18:25,440
Your mother thinks
you might be losing your mind over me.

321
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:28,242
As a neurobiologist, I was curious.

322
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,874
Well, rest assured,
I am in full possession of my faculties.

323
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,513
Twenty-five cats!

324
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,350
Oh.

325
00:18:36,524 --> 00:18:37,923
God bless you, dear.

326
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:41,062
Sheldon, sit down. Let's talk.

327
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:44,130
You're not fooling me.
Whenever you say we have to talk...

328
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:45,960
...it means you want me to listen.

329
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:47,965
- Then stop talking.
- Yes, ma'am.

330
00:18:48,136 --> 00:18:50,934
Now, the reason I called Amy over...

331
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:53,438
...was to find out
what type of person she is.

332
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:55,200
And after chatting a bit...

333
00:18:55,377 --> 00:19:01,043
...I have to say that while she is
a perfectly unique young woman...

334
00:19:01,216 --> 00:19:04,515
...you two are definitely
not suited for each other.

335
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,883
That's a peculiar conclusion.

336
00:19:07,055 --> 00:19:09,421
By any standard,
Amy is more similar to me...

337
00:19:09,591 --> 00:19:11,081
...than anyone I've ever met.

338
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:13,887
Oh, I'm sorry, Shelly, I can't see it.

339
00:19:14,062 --> 00:19:16,428
Well, whether you see it or not
is irrelevant.

340
00:19:16,598 --> 00:19:20,557
I can't see subatomic particles,
but nevertheless, they're there.

341
00:19:20,735 --> 00:19:23,397
- Excellent point.
- A physics point.

342
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:25,834
Touché.

343
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,270
Well, putting aside the pig Latin...

344
00:19:29,411 --> 00:19:32,175
...it's a good that you decided
to end the relationship...

345
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:34,338
...so I didn't have to end it for you.

346
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:40,816
Amy, after consideration,
I believe we may have acted rashly.

347
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:45,153
I propose we resume our relationship
and attempt to resolve our differences.

348
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:46,487
Only if you stipulate...

349
00:19:46,661 --> 00:19:49,289
...80 percent of our difficulties
were caused by you.

350
00:19:49,464 --> 00:19:50,988
- I'll go as high as 40.
- 65.

351
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,599
Done.

352
00:19:53,768 --> 00:19:57,966
You understand we deal with the fact
that my mother does not approve?

353
00:19:58,506 --> 00:19:59,871
I do.

354
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:03,476
I find being cast in the role of bad girl
oddly titillating.

355
00:20:06,014 --> 00:20:08,141
- Would you like to see my cats?
- I would.

356
00:20:08,316 --> 00:20:10,648
I love cats.
They're the epitome of indifference.

357
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:14,152
Ah. Then you may find Zazzles
a little cloying.

358
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:17,284
I saw what you did there.

359
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:20,656
He thinks he's such a smarty pants,
he's no different from any man.

360
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:23,525
Tell them not to do something,
that's all they wanna do.

361
00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:27,099
If I hadn't told my brother Stumpy
not to clear the wood chipper by hand...

362
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,860
...we'd still be calling him Edward.

363
00:20:30,872 --> 00:20:33,397
Now, don't you move,
I'll bring over all the food.

364
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,337
No, no, no, I can do it.

365
00:20:37,412 --> 00:20:39,710
Well, isn't that sweet?

366
00:20:44,552 --> 00:20:46,042
