1
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:07,503
I don't know why I avoided the Harry Potter
books for so long. These are great.

2
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:10,801
- I just started number six.
- That's a good one.

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,535
Dumbledore dies in that one.

4
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,443
Yeah, I know, I didn't see it coming, either.

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,918
Why would you say that?

6
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,522
You brought up a subject,
I contributed a fact on that subject.

7
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:27,887
It's called the art of conversation.
Okay, your turn.

8
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,524
That was a huge spoiler.

9
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,323
Good.

10
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:38,398
What is wrong with you?
If I did that, you'd bitch about it for weeks.

11
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,937
Really, Leonard?
Gonna have one of your hissy fits?

12
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,101
Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?

13
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,868
Yes. And I have a theory why.

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,209
Because of your lactose intolerance,
you switched over to soy milk.

15
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,750
Soy contains estrogen-mimicking
compounds.

16
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:59,084
I think your morning Cocoa Puffs
are turning you into a hysterical woman.

17
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,289
You are unbelievable.
I don't know why I put up with you.

18
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:11,095
- You're controlling, you're irritating...
- There you go again. Nag, nag, nag.

19
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,300
You're only proving my point, little lady.

20
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,137
You know what, screw you, Sheldon.

21
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,743
You're the most annoying person
I've ever met.

22
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:23,905
I'm annoying?
You criticize my behavior all the time.

23
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:28,144
"Sheldon, don't talk about
your bowel movements over breakfast."

24
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,618
"Sheldon, when the president
of the university...

25
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:34,590
...is giving a eulogy at a funeral,
don't yawn and point at your watch."

26
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:37,627
"Sheldon, don't throw away my shirts
because they're ugly."

27
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,128
You're impossible.

28
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,191
That's it, I don't have to put up with this.

29
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:46,394
Actually, I have your signature
on a roommate agreement that says you do.

30
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:50,134
Aww. Here's what I think
of your roommate agreement.

31
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,044
- You pick that up right now.
- No.

32
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,273
Roommate agreement,
section 27, paragraph 5:

33
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:02,319
"The roommate agreement, like the
American flag, cannot touch the ground."

34
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,014
I don't care.

35
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:10,720
I don't have to do anything you say, because
I don't think I wanna live here anymore.

36
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,624
- Where are you going?
- To live with Penny...

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,290
...not you, you crazy bastard.

38
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,470
- Crazy bastard?
- Yes.

39
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,066
- Leonard, wait.
- What?

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,667
Dobby the Elf dies in book seven.

41
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:55,731
Here you go.

42
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:58,739
- Great. Come on in.
- What, you don't say thank you?

43
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,572
It's my suitcase.
I lent it to you two years ago.

44
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,550
I should tell you
I broke the wheel and the handle.

45
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,182
So is everyone from Bernadette's company
going to Vegas?

46
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,088
No, just me, her,
and a couple of the bigwigs.

47
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,024
It's part of a bonus she got.

48
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,357
Cool. Did she discover a cure
for something?

49
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:23,593
Not exactly. They spent a ton of money
developing this dandruff medication...

50
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:27,364
...that had the side effect
of horrible anal leakage.

51
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,806
Is there a good anal leakage?

52
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:39,084
Anyway, it was Bernie's idea to rebrand
the stuff as a cure for constipation.

53
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:44,646
Way to make lemonade, you know, from
around the corner where fudge is made.

54
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,729
- Hey, I got a favor to ask.
- Sure.

55
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,592
My mom's been
kind of an emotional wreck...

56
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,758
...since that dentist she was dating
dumped her.

57
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,768
Dumped her? What did he use, a forklift?

58
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,908
Sorry.

59
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,772
There's nothing funny
about morbid obesity.

60
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,281
She's huge, it was funny.

61
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:13,846
Anyway, I was just hoping that maybe you
could check in on her tomorrow night...

62
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,921
...make sure she's doing okay.
- Dude, I'm a single man.

63
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,615
Saturday night is my party night.

64
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,656
Really, what do you got going on?

65
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,127
I don't know, maybe drive
down to Hollywood...

66
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,631
...hit a few hot spots,
see if I can get lucky.

67
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,202
Tell me if this sounds familiar. Ahem.

68
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,965
You pay $15 to park,
you stand on the sidewalk for an hour...

69
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:39,008
...until you break down and
give the bouncer 20 to let you in.

70
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,648
You push your way to the bar
where you drink an $18 cosmopolitan.

71
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,285
Then you stare at a pretty girl
and imagine your perfect life together.

72
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,284
Children, grandchildren.
Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy...

73
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,889
...who claims he wrote
Beverly Hills Chihuahua.

74
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,692
Then you give up on love,
go to Marie Callender's...

75
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,989
...buy a pie and eat it in your car
in the parking lot.

76
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,835
- What time should I be at your mother's?
- I told her around 7.

77
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:11,500
I swear, that man is the most egotistical,
insufferable human being I have ever met.

78
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,605
Yeah, but you two
make such a cute couple.

79
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,912
Like Bert and Ernie.

80
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,517
You guys even teach me stuff
about words and numbers.

81
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,156
Well, I've had it, I am done.

82
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,189
I can't live with him one more minute.

83
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,190
Wow, where are you gonna go?

84
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,329
Well, I was thinking here with you.

85
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,264
Oh.

86
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,631
Is that a problem?

87
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,431
No, no, no. It's great.

88
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,870
It's terrific. You know, I just can't
help feel bad about Sheldon.

89
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:47,171
I mean, how's he gonna
get by without you...

90
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,037
...Ernie?

91
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,845
- He's got Amy now.
- Yeah, he does...

92
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,543
...but it's not the same.
- Why?

93
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,187
Um...

94
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:02,361
Well, all right, you know how
in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince...

95
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,895
...Ron didn't abandon Harry
because Harry started dating Ron's sister?

96
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,727
Harry and Ginny get together?

97
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:17,702
Sorry, spoiler alert. My point is,
as much as I want to live with you...

98
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,276
...I can't do it knowing how much
Sheldon needs you.

99
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,472
Please. The only thing he needs me for
is to be his whipping boy.

100
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,479
His stooge, his doormat.

101
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,448
Well, you know what they say,
if it ain't broke...

102
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:34,188
Wow, it sounds to me like
you don't want us to live together.

103
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:39,798
No. No, no, I do. I do.
It's just... It's a really big step.

104
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,457
Is it? We're together all the time.
Financially, it makes great sense.

105
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,763
Can you think of one reason
why we shouldn't do this?

106
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,298
Well, um...

107
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,738
Heh. I'm just a little thirsty.

108
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,342
I got nothing.

109
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,846
Great. I'll go get my stuff.

110
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,118
Okay. All right, don't freak out.
You can make this work.

111
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:16,132
Oh. Could you clear off a shelf for me
in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine.

112
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,233
Oh, please, let some of it be Xanax.

113
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,969
Are you ready for dessert?

114
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,113
No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz.

115
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,179
As is, I'm going to have to carry
my stomach out of here...

116
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,752
...like I'm a fireman rescuing an infant.

117
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:41,183
Oh, please, you're a tall glass
of brown water.

118
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,130
- Have dessert.
- I really couldn't.

119
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:49,062
But I've had a lovely time eating your
brisket and hearing about the things...

120
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,169
...you've had removed from your body
over the years.

121
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:56,202
I didn't know you could have
a cyst inside another cyst.

122
00:07:56,576 --> 00:08:00,273
The doctor said they were like
Russian nesting dolls.

123
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:06,078
Well, if you have to go, how about
I put a little doggie bag together for you?

124
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,014
That would be lovely, thank you.

125
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,292
Mrs. Wolowitz...

126
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,487
...are you okay?

127
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,993
Don't mind me.

128
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,894
I just cry when I'm Ionely
and have nothing to live for.

129
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,673
I...

130
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,333
I suppose I could stay for some dessert.

131
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,705
Great. You like
chocolate chip cheesecake?

132
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,507
- Sure.
- I'll make one.

133
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:43,385
One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure.

134
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:47,685
- That's Leonard's.
- Children's toy.

135
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,954
One Star Trek: The Next Generation
phaser.

136
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,221
That's Leonard's.

137
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,066
Children's toy.

138
00:08:55,601 --> 00:09:00,595
One Game of Thrones
collector's edition Longclaw sword.

139
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,365
Leonard and I bought that together.

140
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,067
That's a bit of an ethical conundrum.

141
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,907
I'll keep it.

142
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,708
So, what's your plan moving forward?

143
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:15,251
I suppose I'll have to find and cultivate
a new roommate.

144
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,217
What a task that will be.

145
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:20,915
Do you know how uncivilized
Leonard was when I took him in?

146
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,852
- No.
- It took me forever...

147
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,088
...to get him on a bathroom schedule.

148
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,996
He would just go
whenever the mood struck him.

149
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:34,234
- Like a dog boy.
- Exactly.

150
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,603
What if you could find a roommate
who was a scientist...

151
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,404
...and already familiar and comfortable
with your ways?

152
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:41,978
That would be ideal.

153
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:47,414
If a person like that existed,
I would sign on, no further questions asked.

154
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,611
Great, here I am.

155
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,424
Wait.

156
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,529
Here who is where?

157
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,463
Me. Aren't I your perfect roommate?

158
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,602
- Um...
- Think about it, Sheldon.

159
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,468
I'm not a stranger,
we're intellectually compatible...

160
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,940
...I'm willing to chauffeur you around,
and your personality quirks...

161
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:17,343
...which others find abhorrent
or rage-inducing, I find cute as a button.

162
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,314
What do you think?

163
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,124
Um...

164
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,921
Tell me one reason
why this isn't a fantastic idea.

165
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,530
Um...

166
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,792
See? You can't.

167
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,369
I'm gonna go see if Leonard's room
is big enough for my water bed.

168
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,903
Um...

169
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,107
Good buddy Leonard?
Good buddy Leonard.

170
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,976
Good buddy Leonard?

171
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,319
- What do you want?
- Hey, good buddy.

172
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,883
So I was just talking to Amy...

173
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,992
...and she made me realize
that this little dust-up...

174
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,594
...between you and me
is much ado about nothing.

175
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,823
- Is that so?
- Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home.

176
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:12,471
I'll make you some soy hot chocolate
and then I'll tell you about...

177
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,199
...our exciting new
devil-may-care bathroom policy.

178
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,477
Cut to the chase, Sheldon.

179
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,206
Okay. Amy has decided
she wants to move in with me...

180
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,908
...so I need you to come back home,
you lovable scamp.

181
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,951
That's a lot of product.

182
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,553
- Hey. What's going on?
- Get this.

183
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:37,126
Suddenly, Sheldon wants me back
because Amy wants to move in with him.

184
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,297
Really? Interesting.

185
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,360
Well, too late, pal, I'm not going anywhere.

186
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:45,799
Penny and I are very happy living together.
Isn't that right?

187
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,872
It's like the happiness
won't ever leave the apartment.

188
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,835
Leonard, please,
you know Amy moving in...

189
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,945
...marks a level of intimacy
our relationship isn't ready for.

190
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:59,516
Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn't
mean you don't care about each other...

191
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,883
...it just means things are moving at a pace
you're not comfortable with. And that's fine.

192
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,184
If he doesn't wanna live with her,
he should tell her how he feels.

193
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,385
Maybe he doesn't know how to say it
without hurting her feelings.

194
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,895
Feelings? Who am I,
a hippie at a love-in? No.

195
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,093
The problem is she laid out a series
of logical arguments that I couldn't refute.

196
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:21,033
- That is the worst, isn't it?
- Yes.

197
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,208
I'm sorry, Sheldon. I can't help you.

198
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,742
Oh, spoiler alert:
This door's about to slam in your face.

199
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:33,082
Oh, there you are.
When do I get a key to our apartment?

200
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,681
Um...

201
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,131
- Hello?
- Hey.

202
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:55,466
- How'd it go last night with my mom?
- Okay, I guess.

203
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:56,834
What time did you leave?

204
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,969
Actually, I'm still here.

205
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,645
- What? You spent the night?
- Yeah.

206
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,782
After dinner,
we watched a rerun of Rockford Files...

207
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,458
...and then she opened
a bottle of cream sherry...

208
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,561
...and the next thing I know
she was tucking me into your bed.

209
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,164
You wore my pajamas?

210
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,561
Mm-hm.

211
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:26,133
How do you sleep in these things?
Silk pajamas on satin sheets?

212
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,102
I slid out of the bed like three times.

213
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,341
Rajesh? You up?

214
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,840
You ready for breakfast?

215
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,671
Oh, boy, breakfast.

216
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,380
Okay, Raj, listen.
You need to get out of there.

217
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:43,714
But I have a cream sherry hangover
and I smell blintzes.

218
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:49,388
If you don't leave now, she'll use food and
guilt to keep you there the rest of your life.

219
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:50,652
Oh, Howard, stop.

220
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,696
Trust me, you're not Jewish,
that's how they get you.

221
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,700
You're being silly.
I can leave whenever I want.

222
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:00,599
Oh, really?
Where are your clothes and your shoes?

223
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,138
They're on the chair right over...

224
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,206
Oy vey.

225
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,377
Hello, homewrecker.

226
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:17,748
What did I do?

227
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,890
You gave Leonard somewhere to go.

228
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,390
Thanks to you, Amy's out
buying his and hers bath towels.

229
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:27,326
Like I'd ever dry myself with something
that has a possessive pronoun on it.

230
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,865
Okay, listen...

231
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,331
...the truth is
I don't want him living with me.

232
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,168
Great. Kick him out, break his heart,
everybody wins.

233
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:41,405
No, I don't wanna break his heart,
I love him. This is happening too fast.

234
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:42,705
You think this is fast?

235
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:46,407
It is just a matter of time before
I see Amy's leg stubble in my shower.

236
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,650
Yeah, and I've seen those legs.
You might wanna get some Drano.

237
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,056
Hold on. If you don't want to live
with Leonard, why don't you just tell him?

238
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,958
Well, you know how he is.
He's sensitive and emotional.

239
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,666
That's because he drinks
too much soy milk.

240
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,863
I don't know what else
we can do but tell them the truth.

241
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,900
I suppose there's no choice
but to face the crying...

242
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:13,169
...angry accusations,
and the high-pitched wails of despair.

243
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,405
Yeah. And who knows
how Amy will react.

244
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:21,779
Here's some more ice.

245
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,488
- Thanks.
- What were we thinking?

246
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,420
We should have just done it
the regular way.

247
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:33,755
Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque Du Soleil
made it look so easy.

248
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,700
Honestly, if I could bend that far,
what would I need with you?

249
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,300
If you could bend that far,
you'd be doing us both a favor.

250
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,483
Hey, Raj, what's up?

251
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,620
You were right. I can't get out of here.

252
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,151
- You're still at my mother's?
- I'm trapped.

253
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:03,522
My clothes have been in the laundry
all day, and she hid my keys.

254
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:07,960
I think they might be in her bra
because she jingles when she walks.

255
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,658
What do I do?

256
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,837
Hey, you wanted a woman in your life,
now you got one.

257
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,234
Come on, Howard, help me.

258
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:19,275
Rajesh, tatellah, I ran you a bath!

259
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:24,044
Oh, my God,
she's not gonna bathe me, is she?

260
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:30,021
Gee, I wish I could tell you no.

261
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,491
All right, well, thanks again
for helping me out.

262
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,186
Howard...

263
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:43,030
- Should we go back and rescue him?
- Too late. We'll see him at his bar mitzvah.

264
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:46,995
Here you go.

265
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:50,403
I picked up the Chinese food
just the way Leonard used to.

266
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,166
- Is it kung pao chicken?
- Yes.

267
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,039
- Brown rice, not white rice?
- Yes.

268
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,179
- Spicy mustard from the Korean deli?
- Yes.

269
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,680
- I did good, right?
- Yes.

270
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:05,082
Amy, are you worried
that us living together...

271
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,724
...will take the mystery
out of our relationship?

272
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:11,054
- No.
- Yeah, why would you?

273
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,820
Oh, and check this out.

274
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:17,560
I took the liberty of scripting a new
outgoing voicemail message for both of us.

275
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,999
"Hello, this is Sheldon."

276
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,232
"And this is Amy."

277
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:25,910
"We're not home right now."

278
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,739
"'Cause we out dropping science, son."

279
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,880
- "Leave a message."
- "Leave a message."

280
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,788
Beep. Heh.

281
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,960
You can't live here.

282
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:49,225
What? Why? Is it the message?

283
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:53,963
I only used urban slang to sound tough
so people wouldn't break in.

284
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,400
It's not the message.

285
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:59,065
Well, what is it then?
I did everything just the way you like it.

286
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,940
- You did.
- Then what the hell, Sheldon?

287
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:08,916
We have been going out for over two years,
and I've been nothing but patient with you.

288
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:13,080
I watch your dopey space movies,
I signed your ridiculous contracts.

289
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,784
I stopped wearing lip gloss because
you said it made my mouth look slippery.

290
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,432
I am the best girlfriend
you're ever gonna have.

291
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,227
You give me one good reason
why I can't live here.

292
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,364
It's Penny's fault.

293
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,234
- What?
- She doesn't wanna live with Leonard...

294
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,969
...so he has to come live here again.
She's the snake in our garden.

295
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,012
She's the reason we can't be happy.

296
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,950
- Hey, Ames.
- Yeah, "Hey, Ames" nothing.

297
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,918
I was all set to move in
with Sheldon and I can't because...

298
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,923
- ...you don't wanna live with Leonard.
- What?

299
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,792
Sheldon, what did you say?

300
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,989
The truth. You don't wanna live
with Leonard and you know it.

301
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,499
- Since when don't you want to live with me?
- You decided to move in...

302
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,640
...without even asking me if I was ready.
- I think we should talk about that.

303
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,000
Since you love the truth so much...

304
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,543
...why not tell Amy you don't wanna
live with her instead of blaming me?

305
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,010
I thought we were talking about
the other thing.

306
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:16,477
- You're a coward.
- Well, the evidence does support that.

307
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:22,984
Come on, Amy. Let's go drink wine and talk
about what jerks our boyfriends are.

308
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:26,687
You know what would show them?
I should move in here with you.

309
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,567
Um...

310
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,544
So you wanna catch up
on some Walking Dead?

311
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:47,576
Okay.

312
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,379
Have you seen the one where Lori dies?

313
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,218
No.

314
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,662
Or maybe she doesn't, let's find out.

315
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,778
- Where are you going?
- No!
