BBC America, and watched Doctor Who.

Why don't you have breakfast in bed?

172
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:34,413
Because I am neither an invalid
nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.

What time is it?

00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,544
Almost 6:30.

No, it's 6:30 in the morning.

Oh, yeah. Sorry, I'll have it cleaned.

Yours reaches places

You used my loofa?

More precisely, we used your loofa.

I exfoliated her brains out.

You can keep that too.

in Beverly Hills.

Yeah, no, I meant plans to find

I do not. My mother lives with me.

We can't order Chinese food

Let me walk you through it.

233
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,821
Our standard order is,
the steamed dumpling appetizer...

...General Tso's chicken,
beef with broccoli...

...shrimp with lobster sauce,

I see a problem.

238
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:19,967
Our entire order is predicated
on four dumplings and four entrées...

239
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:22,633
...divided amongst four people.

240
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,641
So we'll just order three entrées.

00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,407
Fine. What do you wanna eliminate?

242
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:31,485
-And who gets the extra dumpling?
-We could cut it into thirds.

243
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:33,121
Then it's no longer a dumpling.

244
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,089
Once you cut it open, it is, at best,
a very small open-faced sandwich.

No substitutions.

252

This isn't a substitution.
It's a reduction.

Okay. No reductions.

-That's 1 2, we'll each have four.
-That works.

256
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,851
No. Because we'll need
to eliminate another entrée.

No eliminations.

we'll just take the leftovers home.

And divide it how? I'm telling you,
we cannot do this without Wolowitz.

you are driving me crazy.

Your anger is not with me,
but with mathematics.

I'm pretty sure my anger is with you.

Hi, this is Howard Wolowitz.

And this is Christy Vanderbelt.

right now because we're having sex.

You're not gonna put
that on your message, are you?

No, I'm just kidding. I'll re-record it.

Sheldon, think this through.

322
00:18:36,265 --> 00:18:39,291
You're going to ask Howard
to choose between sex and " Halo."

No, I'm going to ask him
to choose between sex and "Halo 3."

00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:45,698
As far as I know,
sex has not been upgraded...

325
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:49,037
...to include hi-def graphics
and enhanced weapon systems.

You're right, all sex has is nudity,
orgasms and human contact.

and Howard can hump on it?

I'm sure there's a middle ground.

-Shut up, Howard!

I'll take my scooter out for a little spin.

You drove your son out of the house.

you're barking up the wrong tree.

Because as long as you're around,
Howard is out of the will.

You know what, I got better offers.
I'm out of here.
