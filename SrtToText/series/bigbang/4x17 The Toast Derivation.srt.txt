Buonasera, Luigi's Pizza.
Buonasera, it means "good evening"
in Italian.
May I say having to explain that
to you...
...calls into question
the authenticity of your ristorante?
Okay, I'm out of here.
[SPEAKS IN ITALIAN]
Oh, for heaven's sake,
now you're being deliberately stupid.
- Where are you going?
- I'm having dinner with Priya at Raj's.
- Howard's gonna be there, wanna join us?
- But tonight's Thursday.
On Thursdays everybody comes
over here and has pizza...
...or a reasonable facsimile prepared
by someone claiming to be Luigi...
...but who sounds suspiciously
like Jackie Chan.
Can't we make a one-time exception
for tonight?
We could.
We could also stop using the letter M.
But I think that idea
is isguided and oronic.
Just come with me to Raj's.
- Well, I don't wanna go to a party.
- It's not a party.
It's the same group who hang out here,
hanging out there.
I'm sorry, but five people
eating and chatting is a party.
How come it's not a party
when we do it here?
Because we don't throw parties.
I don't know, Sheldon.
I'm going to see Priya, everyone's there.
You coming?
Well, no, sir, and do you know why?
In a word: Tradition.
Every Thursday night
for the last eight years...
...you and I and our friends
have gathered here in this very spot...
...to break bread
covered with cheese and sauce...
...discuss the issues of the day
and, yes, share a laugh or two.
But I guess our rich heritage
means nothing to you.
- I guess you're right. See you later.
- Wait, Leonard, wait.
What am I going to do for dinner?
- Come with me to Raj's and eat there.
- Well, I can't do that.
What if he serves
haggis and blood pudding?
I really doubt that's what he'll serve.
But what if he does?
I'll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs
stuffed in a sheep's stomach.
Blood pudding is essentially the same.
I don't know why he's serving both.
What do you wanna do?
Do you wanna come or sit here alone?
No, I'll go to your haggis party.
But I'm telling you, this is adness.
This is utter and coplete adness.
SHELDON: Oh, dear.
- What?
Raj's television.
I just realized we're about to spend
an evening watching a plasma screen...
...with a cluster of dead pixels
in the upper left-hand corner.
So don't watch TV, read a book.
And be a social pariah?
You know that's not my style.
[SIGHS]
The audible sigh is a show
of exasperation, right?
Right.
Was it about me or the dead pixels?
Hey, you're just in time.
We made Tex-Mex.
- Oh, sounds great.
- Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex.
Might as well have had
the Chinese pizza.
- Hey, you.
- Hi.
[PRIYA CHUCKLES]
That's gotta be fun for you, huh?
Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva
out of your sister's mouth?
Excuse me, before this evening
goes any further...
...we need to decide
where everyone's going to sit.
There's no assigned seats, Sheldon.
Just sit anywhere,
make yourself comfortable.
Oh, what fun.
We're like hippies at a love-in.
- Just sit here.
- Yeah, right on, man, right on.
Oh, look, it's Harry Potter
and 98 Percent of the Sorcerer's Stone.
Okay, we've got fajitas
with all the fixings...
...so you make your own.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Dinner, some assembly required.
- Do you want a margarita, Sheldon?
- What...? A margarita?
Where are we? What is happening?
Oh, hey, Sheldon. What can I get you?
Water, neat...
...with a little umbrella.
Where are all your friends?
Sadly, Penny, this evening,
I am The Dark Knight...
...roaming these mean streets alone.
A windbreaker for my cape
and a stern expression for my cowl.
Okay.
Excuse me. Isn't this the point...
...where the world-weary barkeep
absent-mindedly wipes down the bar...
...and coaxes the woes
out of the troubled patron?
Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella,
but all right.
What's troubling you, buddy?
I don't think your heart's in it,
but since you asked...
Apparently, because Leonard is dating
Raj's sister...
...we're all forced to hang out
at his apartment.
- Oh, the horror.
- Yeah. Indeed.
Yeah, at one point,
Raj put on reggae music...
...and his sister took off her shoes.
It was like the last days of Caligula.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
Oh, I have to get this.
Umbrella?
[SIGHS]
I wonder
what she's exasperated about?
Hello?
Sheldon, are you all right?
When last we spoke,
you were gonna take a taxi home from Raj's.
But according to Facebook, you just
checked in at the Cheesecake Factory.
Yes, I was in a taxi...
...but the driver didn't look at all
like the photograph on his license.
So I leapt out and ran for it.
Wise.
Here you go, just like recovering
alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.
AMY:
Hi, bestie.
Oh, hi, Amy. How you been?
Fine. From this angle,
I can see up your nose.
Yeah, it's a great time
to be alive, isn't it?
Don't worry, my problems can wait
while you two hens finish your clucking.
Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya.
She's staying with Raj.
That means you're all probably gonna
be hanging out there more.
AMY:
Penny, sorry you got dragged into this.
I know you're devastated
that your ex-boyfriend...
...has found an exciting new lover
with flawless caramel-colored skin.
Okay, I'm not upset
about Leonard and Priya.
Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.
Cluck, cluck, cluck.
Sheldon, look at me.
I think it's time to face the fact that
Leonard is the nucleus of your group.
Where he goes, the group goes.
Leonard, the nucleus?
That makes no sense.
I'm the whimsical elf
that everyone looks to for a good time.
I'm not saying that you're not fun.
You're the most fun person I know.
A lot of people
think I'm fun to be around.
Don't be needy, bestie.
That's probably part
of what chased Leonard away.
What I am saying, Sheldon,
is that your group is Leonard-centric.
If it were a town,
it would be Leonardville.
If it were an Islamic nation,
Leonardstan.
If it were the birthplace
of motion pictures...
...we'd all be singing
"Hooray for Leonardwood."
Oh, I got a one.
If you guys were a band...
...you'd be called
Leonard and the Leonards.
[CHUCKLES]
So needy.
- What you doing?
- I'm setting out snacks.
You do realize everyone's eating
at Raj's again tonight.
I didn't say the snacks were for you,
now, did I, Nosy Rosie?
- You're having people over?
- Yes.
Must be killing you, wondering who.
Fine, I'll tell you.
It's Stuart from the comic book store,
Barry Kripke from the university...
...Penny's ex-boyfriend, Zack,
and TV's LeVar Burton.
Really? LeVar Burton's coming here?
Possibly, I tweeted him.
Okay, well, tell him
I loved him on Star Trek.
Please, Leonard,
stop trying to horn in on my new friends.
Of course, good night.
- Leonard.
- Yeah?
We had a good run, you and I.
Okay.
But change is a part of life.
It certainly is.
Okay.
I have guests coming.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave now.
- I am leaving.
- Don't make this harder than it is.
- Goodbye, Sheldon.
- And goodbye to you, sir.
He'll be back.
LEONARD:
Of course I'll be back, I live here!
Well, it would appear
LeVar Burton won't be joining us.
So, um, let's get started.
Uh, I thought we'd begin by going
around the room, introducing ourselves...
...and saying a little bit
about why we're here.
Okay, ahem, uh, I'm Sheldon.
Uh, for readers of the New England
Journal of High Energy Physics...
...I need no introduction.
If you're not familiar with that,
there's a free copy in your goody bag.
Stuart?
Um, ahem, hi, I'm Stuart.
I run a comic book store...
...which, for financial reasons,
I'm currently living in.
And I guess what I'm hoping for most
out of tonight is a hot shower.
That's very nice, Stuart. Zack?
I'm Zack and I'm, uh...
Uh...
Could you come back to me?
Of course. Barry?
I'm Barry Kripke and I'm here
because you told me there was a raffle.
When is the raffle?
Patience, patience, Barry, the waffle...
Ahem.
The raffle...
...is the grand finale to an evening-long
festival of fun and folly.
- One more question...
- Yes, you must be present to win.
Okay, I'm ready. I'm Zack and I'm, uh...
Oh, crap, why is this so hard?
PENNY: Oh, hey.
- Hi.
- Yo, P-Dawg.
- Ha, ha. What's up?
We're here to kidnap you
for a girls' night out.
Parenthetical, the term "kidnap"
is being used playfully.
I kind of figured that.
Good, now put this pillowcase
over your head.
No.
She used to be much more fun
until Leonard punched her in the heart.
We thought you might wanna go out,
have a good time, maybe go dancing.
Oh, gee, thanks,
but I'm not really in the mood.
You do understand it will distract you...
...from obsessing
over the rich variety of sweet loving...
...your ex-boyfriend is receiving
from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.
[SIGHS]
Okay, look, if I agree to go out
with you guys...
...will you stop pestering me
about Leonard and Priya?
- Yes.
- Sure.
All right, I'll go change.
Come on in.
If you'd have let me bring chloroform, we
wouldn't have had all this jibber jabber.
Anyway, after snowboarding,
I go to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi.
There's no one around,
so naturally I'm free-balling it.
Next thing I know,
this beautiful chick shows up.
Drunk out of her skull,
wants to get in with me.
Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?
- Really, that's your question?
- What's the difference?
Jacuzzi is a commercial brand,
hot tub is the generic term...
...i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs
but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.
Is that like all thumbs are fingers
but not all fingers are thumbs?
Surprisingly, yes.
Nice.
Now, what exactly are toes?
Can you please
get back to the drunk girl?
I'd like something to think about
in the shower.
Oh, yeah, right.
She takes off all of her clothes,
climbs in the hot tub.
- And the first thing I notice...
- The water level rose.
- No.
- Well, of course it did.
It's said that Archimedes,
the ancient Greek mathematician...
...discovered the principle
of displacement while taking a bath.
Terrific. Go ahead, Zack.
Naked drunk girl, free-balling, continue.
Wait, forgive me...
...but I think you'll find
my story is more interesting.
Does yours have wet breasts in it?
Better, it has a gold crown.
You see, the king wondered
how much gold was in it...
...and charged Archimedes
with coming up with the solution.
The crown was irregularly shaped, there
was no way to determine its volume.
But while bathing,
Archimedes realized...
...he could immerse the crown
and measure the amount the water rose.
So long story short, I nailed her.
When he finished,
he shouted, "Eureka."
No, I always shout, "Holy moly."
Don't know why, just do.
All right, that concludes the getting-
to-know-you portion of the evening.
Now who's ready to play
some vintage video games?
Tonight's selections include...
...ColecoVision's
"Smurf: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle"...
...Atari's "Cookie Monster Munch"...
...and for you
text-adventure aficionados, "Zork."
[IN HIGH-PITCH VOICE]
Pick me, pick me, I'm fun.
That all sucks the big hairy meatball.
How about I get the karaoke machine
out of my car...
...get plastered
and blow the roof off this place?
- Great, I'll make a beer run.
- And I'll take a shower.
- We'll meet back here in 15.
- Check.
[DOORS CLOSE]
I'm unhappy.
This is delicious.
Where did you learn to make chili?
When I was at university in England,
my flatmate was from Texas.
I hope she wasn't anything
like my flatmate from Texas.
[CHUCKLES]
Sheldon is a bit quirky, isn't he?
Oh, please, that crazy bastard is looking
at quirky in the rearview mirror.
Did you know that per our
roommate agreement...
...I have to wash my feet
before I get in the shower?
And not in the sink,
we each have special buckets.
[CHUCKLES]
Raj, did you tell your sister about the time
Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?
- Oh, God, you're kidding.
RAJESH: Ha, ha. Nope.
Gates gave a speech at the university,
Sheldon went up to him and said:
"Maybe if you weren't so distracted
by sick children in Africa...
...you could have put a little
more thought into Windows Vista."
[ALL LAUGHING]
Bam, right in the nose.
Made me proud to own a PC.
I'd like to propose a toast.
To a rare and wonderful
Sheldon-free evening.
LEONARD: Hear, hear.
HOWARD: Cheers.
That's the first time
we've ever done that...
...without having Sheldon tell us
why it's called a toast.
And why is it called a toast?
Oh, the ancient Romans
put spiced toast in their punch bowls.
Sheldon tells it better.
- He kind of does.
- Yeah.
Oh, hell, I miss him.
- Where do you guys wanna go dancing?
- We were hoping you'd know a place.
Yes, perhaps somewhere
packed tightly...
...with young beautiful bodies,
sweating and writhing...
...against each other
in a glorious orgy of the flesh.
Oh, yeah, I know that place.
What do you think?
That should display enough bosom
to attract a new mate or a hungry infant.
Okay, let's go through this
one more time.
Just because Leonard
has a new girlfriend...
...doesn't mean I need to hook up
with some guy.
- But you could if you wanted to, right?
- Well, yeah, I guess.
Pick out the hottest guy
in the room...
...take him home,
do unspeakable things to him.
Kick him to the curb...
...with a smile on his face
and teeth marks on his heinie?
More or less.
What's that like?
PENNY: I don't know,
it's fun while you're doing it.
And then after it's mostly embarrassment,
self-loathing and regret.
I would take that deal all day long.
PENNY: Yeah, well,
it's not gonna happen tonight.
You know, for the first time in life...
...l'm not in a relationship
and I'm totally okay with it.
You know, if being on your own
is new to you, I'd be happy to share...
...some tension-relieving techniques
for ladies I've perfected over the years.
For example,
do you have an electric toothbrush?
PENNY: Uh, no.
- You should get one.
What's that?
It appears to be something preserved
between two pieces of acrylic.
PENNY: Oh, it's a snowflake from the north
pole. Leonard gave it to me last year.
Oh, God, that is so romantic.
Yeah, it was.
Leonard's really one of a kind.
Saying that while holding a snowflake
is a little heavy-handed, don't you think?
Let me see that.
Oh, screw it.
I can deal with a little self-loathing.
Let's go find me a heinie to bite.
Outstanding. And if we fail...
...we always can stop at CVS
and pick you out a nice toothbrush.
I call mine Gerard.
That's kind of creepy.
[SINGING]
Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Oh, honey, if I get restless
Baby, you're not that kind
Don't go breaking my heart
Anybody do
"Walking on Sunshine" yet?
- No.
- Dibs.
I'm sorry, Sheldon bought a loom
and learned how to weave?
He actually got pretty good.
He made us all matching serapes.
I still wear mine
when there's a nip in the air.
Now, was this before or after
he adopted the 25 cats?
Long before the cats.
I think it was around the time...
...he tried to declare our apartment
a sovereign nation.
I still have some of the currency.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
SHELDON:
All my friends. All my friends.
All my friends.
I think it's like Beetlejuice.
We said his name too many times.
- Come on in.
- Thank you.
Hey, I thought you were
with your new buddies.
I had to leave.
They were having fun wrong.
- Come here, Sheldon, sit with me.
- Thank you.
Would you like some homemade chili?
Are there beans in it?
- Yes.
- Oh, then it's not chili.
Real chili has no beans in it.
But you're from a foreign land,
so your ignorance is forgiven.
- Sheldon, do you want some or not?
- Yes, please.
Your girlfriend's
a little short-tempered.
I'd like to propose a toast.
To friends, no matter how quirky.
ALL:
Cheers.
Priya, do you know
why this is called a toast?
Actually, I do.
I believe the Romans used to put
spiced toast in their punch bowls.
She's also a bit of a know-it-all.
Mm.
This is good. Whatever it is.
[SINGING]
I'm walking on sunshine
Whoa
- I'm walking on sunshine
- Whoa
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Hello, I...
Oh, I don't think so.
I am so done with Twitter.
[English - US - SDH]
