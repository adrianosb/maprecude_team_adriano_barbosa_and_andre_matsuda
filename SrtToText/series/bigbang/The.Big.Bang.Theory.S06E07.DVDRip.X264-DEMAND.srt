00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,268
Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:10,239
Welcome to
Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun With Flags.

3
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:12,937
Before we get started...

4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:16,776
...I'd like to announce the winner of our
"design your own flag" competition...

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,611
...but I can't.

6
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:24,655
The only entry was from GameyGamer75,
I know that was a JPEG of your buttocks.

7
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:28,290
Now, this week,
we have a very special episode...

8
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:32,921
...where we explore the flags of the popular
entertainment franchise Star Trek.

9
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:37,058
And to help me, I'm pleased to introduce
Internet personality...

10
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,001
...former star of
Star Trek: The Next Generation...

11
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:45,509
...and the only guy I know lucky enough
to be immortalized in one-sixteenth scale.

12
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:48,010
Set phasers to "fun"...

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,116
...for my friend Wil Wheaton.

14
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,782
- Hi, thanks for having me. Happy to be here.
- Cut.

15
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,962
- What's wrong?
- Sorry, you were brilliant as always.

16
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,461
Wil, that was a little wooden.

17
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,161
- Wooden?
- Don't worry, it wasn't terrible.

18
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:13,032
Just this time,
try to say it the way people sound.

19
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,535
And action.

20
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,005
My friend Wil Wheaton.

21
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,511
Hi, thanks for having me.
I'm excited to be here.

22
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:26,050
- So, Wil, what do you have for us first?
- Well, this is an exciting one.

23
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,653
This is the flag
of the United Federation of Planets.

24
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,620
- Now, what's interesting about this flag...
- Cut.

25
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:36,561
- What was wrong with that?
- It's called Fun With Flags.

26
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,426
They're not at half-mast. Nobody died.
Let's try and keep it upbeat.

27
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,968
Um, no offense,
but I've been acting since I was a kid.

28
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,572
I can handle a web show
without a lot of direction.

29
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,832
It's true.

30
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:53,035
In 1982 Wil played the voice
of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH.

31
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,013
You moved me.

32
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,414
You'll have to forgive me.

33
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,747
This is my first time directing.
I just want it to be good.

34
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,216
- So do I.
- Great.

35
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:05,755
So this time, let's try more real boy,
less Pinocchio.

36
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,887
- And action.
- And cut.

37
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,258
You realize I'm doing this for free, right?

38
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:17,095
Yes, and so far,
we're still not getting our money's worth.

39
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,603
Let's try it again.

40
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,969
Everybody's having fun.

41
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,038
And action.

42
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,907
So, Wil...

43
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,348
...what do you have for us first?

44
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,790
Well, this is an exciting one.

45
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,624
This is the flag
of the United Federation of Planets.

46
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:46,924
Cut.

47
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,727
Problem, first-time director?

48
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:51,697
None that I could see.

49
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,431
I saw a man who loved flags
almost as much as I do.

50
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,939
I got goose bumps.

51
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,273
- He was overacting on purpose.
- Really?

52
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,210
Oh, he reminded me
of a young William Shatner.

53
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,147
I'm really happy to do this for you...

54
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,755
...but not if she's gonna be a huge
pain in the ass the whole time.

55
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,883
Are you gonna let him speak to me
like that?

56
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:14,720
Well...

57
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,421
...you're my girlfriend,
and I don't want you to be upset.

58
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,534
Then again, Wil Wheaton's my friend,
and I don't want him to be upset.

59
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,500
Hmm...

60
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,037
This is a sticky wicket.

61
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,139
What do you think?

62
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,078
Can I speak to you for a second?

63
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,009
I'll be right back.

64
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,046
Feel free to play with yourself.

65
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,026
I don't care for your friend,
and he's being rude to me.

66
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,524
You need to ask him to leave.

67
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,493
Amy, I can't just ask Wil Wheaton to leave.

68
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,291
He's a minor celebrity.

69
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,695
Once you explain who he is,
many people recognize him.

70
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,136
Fine, then maybe I should go.

71
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,471
Could you? That would solve everything.

72
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:08,213
You are the best.
I'll see you at dinner tonight?

73
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,441
Sure you wouldn't rather have dinner
with your friend Wil Wheaton?

74
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,711
Come to think of it, I would.

75
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,089
You, little lady, are on fire.

76
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:48,184
Every time we eat here, your mom refuses
to let me help with the dishes.

77
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,582
Don't take it personally.

78
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:53,749
She likes doing them by herself so she can
lick the plates with no one looking.

79
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,654
You ready to go?

80
00:04:55,828 --> 00:05:00,094
Yeah, let me just grab a couple
of fresh turtlenecks.

81
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,827
I don't understand why you keep your stuff
here when there's room at home.

82
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,265
What are you talking about?

83
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:09,636
All I have here is a few sweaters,
books, bank stuff...

84
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,176
...computers, mail, collectibles, medicine
and my electric body groomer.

85
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,745
Ooh! There's my plaid dickey.

86
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:22,718
Oh. Got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents.
Can you believe it? Heh.

87
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,785
Fifty cents sounds right.

88
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,858
- Let's go.
- You know, it's kind of late.

89
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,022
- Why don't we spend the night here?
- Because we don't live here.

90
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,758
- I know.
- Do you?

91
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,800
You said when you got back from space...

92
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,337
...you were gonna move into my apartment,
but half the time we stay here.

93
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,974
That's not true.

94
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:47,476
Howard, I'm doing laundry!
You want me to put anything in for you?!

95
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,707
There's some underwear in the hamper!

96
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,982
Oh, good, I got that new stain stick to try out!

97
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:00,351
Thank you.
I only put it on the list two weeks ago!

98
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,625
Okay, I see what you're getting at.

99
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:09,165
How about this weekend,
I'll box up all my things...

100
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,735
...and move them to our place?

101
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,235
Thank you.

102
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,897
The lightsabers will look great
in the living room.

103
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,942
Or in the closet. We can decide later.

104
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,015
Howard, help!
My hand's stuck in the garbage disposal!

105
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:28,176
Just let go of whatever piece of food
you're holding!

106
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:33,155
Are you kidding?!
It's a perfectly good chicken leg!

107
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,530
Hey, look who's out after dark
like a big boy.

108
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,395
I was out raising heck
with Mr. Wil Wheaton.

109
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:46,402
Four hours more and we would have
closed down the HomeTown Buffet.

110
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,368
- I thought you had plans with Amy.
- Yeah, I did.

111
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,875
But then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S.

112
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,077
She got huffy and left,
and then Wil and I headed out to dinner.

113
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,118
That place really did remind me
of my hometown.

114
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,778
Because there we also have
a HomeTown Buffet.

115
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:10,389
- Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?
- Yes, quite the kerfuffle.

116
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:14,329
- Then Amy got mad and left?
- Walked right out the door.

117
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,058
And you?

118
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,897
Enjoyed a delightful dinner
at a reasonable price.

119
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,735
The manager recognized Wil and let us sit
right next to the frozen-yogurt machine.

120
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,208
Right next to it.

121
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,738
I was closer to it than I am to you right now.

122
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:35,679
- Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.
- Why's that?

123
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:39,416
Because your friend was rude to her
and then you went to dinner with him.

124
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,587
You're just repeating what I said.

125
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,629
It's like living
with a lactose-intolerant parrot.

126
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,731
Trust me. Call her.

127
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,500
Fine.

128
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,866
It's a shame you didn't go
to dinner with us...

129
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,203
...because the buffet you're about to enjoy
only serves humble pie...

130
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,004
...a dessert much less tasty
than frozen yogurt.

131
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,441
I was this close.

132
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,782
What?

133
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:08,779
You'll appreciate this.

134
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,617
Leonard has some ridiculous notion
that you're mad at me.

135
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,783
Tell him you're not mad at me.
Go ahead, set him straight.

136
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,451
I'm mad at you, Sheldon.

137
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,863
Hmm...

138
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,692
Eat one of your Luna Bars.

139
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:26,027
Very often, when women think
they're angry, they're really just hungry.

140
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,073
I'm not hungry.

141
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,308
Your friend insulted me
and you didn't do anything.

142
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:36,141
Precisely. I didn't do anything.

143
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:40,083
Now, does someone feel like checking
her emotional math?

144
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,311
Keep going, buddy. You're doing great.

145
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,151
Sheldon, I'm your girlfriend
and you should have taken my side.

146
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,784
That's it. End of story. Good night.

147
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:56,991
Wow, Amy's mad and Leonard was right.

148
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,160
What a weird day.

149
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,167
Hey, sorry this took so long.
But you used to work here.

150
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,005
- You know how it is.
- Kitchen slammed again?

151
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,340
No, I'm a terrible waitress, remember?

152
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,413
So anything I can do
to help you move tomorrow?

153
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:17,852
Now that you mention it,
I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.

154
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,019
- What's your excuse this time?
- No excuse.

155
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,785
It's just, you know, I'm Jewish...

156
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,864
...and technically, we're not supposed
to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath...

157
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,864
...so this one's on God.

158
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:34,202
That might be more convincing if you didn't
have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.

159
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,635
My religion's kind of loosey-goosey,
you know.

160
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:42,075
As long as you got your schmeckel
clipped and don't wear a cross, you're good.

161
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,441
Howie, you promised you'd move.

162
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,984
- And I will.
- Yeah, right.

163
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:53,217
I'm not going to live in my mother's house
for the rest of my life. I'm not a child.

164
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,891
I've seen her burp you.

165
00:09:58,898 --> 00:09:59,956
She did not burp me.

166
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,363
She was patting me on the back
and I happened to burp.

167
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,229
Don't you have other tables
you should be waiting on?

168
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,807
Yeah, but I told you, I'm not good at my job.

169
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,503
- Listen to me. He is never gonna leave.
- I'm starting to think you're right.

170
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:19,742
All right, I've had enough of this.
I'm a grown man. I have a successful career.

171
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,251
I mean, for the love of God,
I've been to space.

172
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:26,255
I will move out when I'm ready, and I don't
need anyone badgering me into it.

173
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,427
Wow. Excuse me.

174
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:34,764
That was just for her benefit. I'll move
tomorrow. I love you. Don't leave me.

175
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,772
Amy?

176
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,339
Amy.

177
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,637
Angry Amy?

178
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:47,670
What?

179
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:54,278
I've been thinking about what happened,
and I hope this gift will make things better.

180
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,280
Star Trek DVDs?

181
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,789
Why would I want this?

182
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,791
First of all, you're welcome.

183
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,361
Furthermore, not being familiar
with Wil Wheaton's body of work...

184
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:11,560
...there was no way for you to know
you were being rude to a national treasure.

185
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:15,430
Get ready for 130 hours of "I told you so."

186
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,845
Fine, I'll just tell you what happens.

187
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,677
Episode one, "Encounter at Farpoint."

188
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,910
Fade in.

189
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,555
The new Enterprise heads out
on its maiden voyage...

190
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,191
...to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV.

191
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,817
Enter Wesley Crusher,
played by my buddy...

192
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,830
She's hooked.

193
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,969
Wow, an end of an era.

194
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:59,175
Boy, if these walls could talk.

195
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:03,380
They'd say,
"Why does he touch himself so much?"

196
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:09,752
Yeah.

197
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,463
I can't believe
I'm not gonna live here anymore.

198
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,967
This has always been my bedroom.

199
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:22,733
Right here is where my mom
used to mark my height.

200
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,466
Oh, yeah.

201
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:31,014
"Fifth grade, sixth grade,
seventh grade, eighth grade, ninth grade."

202
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:35,314
Yeah, I remember when I was 5...

203
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,820
...hiding under this desk
with all my Halloween candy.

204
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,620
Had some Peanut M&M's...

205
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:46,925
...went into my first anaphylactic shock,
had to be rushed to the hospital...

206
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,830
...came home, celebrated with a Snickers,
went into my second anaphylactic shock.

207
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,167
When did you figure out
you're allergic to nuts?

208
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,172
Sometime around the third Almond Joy.

209
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,838
Okay, wanna start loading this stuff
into the truck?

210
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,912
Yeah, I guess.

211
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,574
Hey, would you do me a favor?
Go on ahead.

212
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:11,621
I just want one last moment alone
in my old room.

213
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,693
We're not standing outside by the U-Haul
while you fondle yourself.

214
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:19,655
Fine, let's go.

215
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,202
Hey, what brings you in?

216
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:34,574
Penny, if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to have a conversation about girls.

217
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:39,642
Had a feeling we'd have a talk like this
sooner or later.

218
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,550
Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?

219
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:47,681
Penny, please, I'm on the horns
of a relationship dilemma.

220
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,694
And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair
by the time I was 19.

221
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,857
And for the record:

222
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,805
- So, what are you drinking?
- Well, it's been a rough day.

223
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:04,170
I usually go chamomile tea,
but I don't think that's gonna cut it.

224
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,610
You could have a Long Island iced tea.

225
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:13,148
Will that calm my nerves?

226
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,220
It's calmed the pants off me a couple times.

227
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,749
- Sold.
- Oh.

228
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:25,186
So the heart you got from the wizard
giving you trouble?

229
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,492
The trouble isn't with me, Penny,
it's with your gender.

230
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,328
Someday scientists will discover...

231
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:34,734
...that second X chromosome contains
nothing but nonsense and twaddle.

232
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,038
Yeah, Amy told me what happened.

233
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,736
Look, just apologize. It'll warm her twaddle.

234
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,174
That's a Band-Aid at best.

235
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,785
The core problem is that Amy and Wil
do not like each other...

236
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:50,388
...which is baffling
because they're both crazy about me.

237
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:55,190
And I like them, which indicates
they're bright and interesting...

238
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,727
...and/or were on Star Trek.

239
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,757
Honey, you can't make people
like each other.

240
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,293
Not true. Leonard made me like you.

241
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,665
Let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe.

242
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,107
Cheers, pal.

243
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,742
Ooh!

244
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:17,171
Boy, that is a treat that's hard to beat.

245
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,811
Get the Mad Hatter on the horn.
I'm having a tea party.

246
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,051
You might wanna pace yourself.

247
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:33,226
I drink tea all the time.
I think I know what I'm doing.

248
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,428
Far be it for me
to criticize a man with a full pubis.

249
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,508
Look, your problem is not Wil Wheaton.
Your problem is the way you treated Amy.

250
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,110
Problem is I'm out of tea.

251
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,677
Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend,
you just let him do it?

252
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,512
Thought you Texas guys stood up
for your womenfolk.

253
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,347
Oh, Penny, please.

254
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,616
Think I've evolved
beyond my simple rustic upbringing.

255
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,850
Sorry.

256
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:04,985
On the other hand, that low-down polecat
done wronged my woman.

257
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,863
Welcome to Long Island, Tex.

258
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,932
Amy deserves better.

259
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,472
You know,
when we buy the Planters Deluxe Mix...

260
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,941
...she eats all the Brazil nuts
so I don't have to look at them.

261
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,448
She's a unique blend of saint and squirrel.

262
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,810
Yup, that she is. Here you go.

263
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,514
I'm a callous egomaniac.
She's gonna leave me.

264
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,750
- No, she won't.
- No, she won't. I'm great.

265
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,635
Ah!

266
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:51,236
Okay, I have now officially moved out
of my mother's house.

267
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,005
You are now the only woman in my life
who I'll see naked in the bathroom.

268
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,641
I know this wasn't easy. You doing okay?

269
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:02,082
Well, I'm fine. It's just her I'm worried about.

270
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:05,817
- She'll be okay. She's a grown woman.
- I know.

271
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:11,054
It's just ever since my dad left,
I've felt responsible for her.

272
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,198
That's a lot for a kid to deal with.

273
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,095
She was just so sad all the time.

274
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,270
I was the only person
who could cheer her up.

275
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,702
Well, me and Ben and Jerry.

276
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,167
She's lucky you were there.

277
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,276
You know, she's why I first got into magic.

278
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,110
I would do little shows for her.

279
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:37,448
Hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain,
put on a top hat and cape.

280
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:43,118
And partway through the act, I would say
I needed a volunteer from the audience...

281
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:49,289
...to be my beautiful assistant
and invite her up on-stage.

282
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,960
I can still remember the way she'd smile.

283
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:58,202
For a few minutes,
she'd forget how Ionely she was.

284
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,377
Aw, crap. Let's go.

285
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,812
Where are we going?

286
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,544
Grab a box.
We'll sleep at your mother's place tonight.

287
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,415
No, but I want to live here.

288
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,650
Well, you should've thought of that before
you told me the stupid magic-trick story.

289
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,222
Can't we talk about this?

290
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:21,457
No husband of mine
is gonna break his mother's heart.

291
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,102
Wil Wheaton.

292
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,106
Wil Wheaton.

293
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,002
Wait, how many was that?

294
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:42,082
- Hey, Sheldon, what's up?
- Wouldn't you like to know.

295
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,585
- Have you been drinking?
- Just tea.

296
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,291
It was the best tea I've ever had.

297
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,028
Why are you here?

298
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,166
I'll tell you.

299
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,529
I'm from Texas.

300
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,504
Need I say more?

301
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,302
Yeah, actually,
a little more would be helpful.

302
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:09,038
You insulted my woman.
I'm here to defend her honor.

303
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,647
Two. It was two.

304
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,409
Wil Wheaton.

305
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:19,652
Now prepare yourself for what may come.

306
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,957
Oh, Sheldon,
do you really think we're gonna fight?

307
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,294
My fists are not up here
because I'm milking a giant invisible cow.

308
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,229
They're up to beat an apology out of you.

309
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,472
Okay, I'm sorry.

310
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,136
Well, that was a long bus ride
for not very much.

311
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:42,705
Are you okay?

312
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,509
You're asking a lot of questions,
Wil Wheaton.

313
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,379
As a matter of idle curiosity...

314
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:52,252
...which of your shrubberies do you feel
would benefit from a thorough vomiting?

315
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,749
Never mind, I'll choose.

316
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,159
You were so good in Stand by Me.

317
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,573
Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

318
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:17,647
Welcome to
Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun With Flags.

319
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,885
Get ready for a very special episode...

320
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,989
...where we explore the flags of the popular
entertainment franchise Star Trek.

321
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,558
And to help us,
I'm pleased to introduce a special guest.

322
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:33,164
Surprisingly, it only took gas money and
the promise of free food to get him here.

323
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,459
Mr. LeVar Burton.

324
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,935
Hey, Sheldon. It's a pleasure to be here.

325
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:42,403
- Well, we've got some interesting flags...
- Cut.

326
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,542
Yikes, this guy is worse than Wil Wheaton.

327
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:53,573
I don't know what she's talking about,
but I'm obligated to agree with her.

328
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,915
- She's my girlfriend.
- Ah. I hear you, brother.

329
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,387
I still get lunch, right?
