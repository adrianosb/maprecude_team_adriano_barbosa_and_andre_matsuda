1
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:08,699
Hey, Stuart, I got you
a little souvenir from my trip to space.

2
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:10,842
Wow, Howard, that's very nice of you.

3
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:13,211
Yeah, maybe. Open it first.

4
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,942
It's my official NASA portrait.

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,154
"To Stuart, your comic book store
is out of this world...

6
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:25,051
...just like the guy in this picture was."

7
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:28,288
For the record,
he also thinks that Walgreens...

8
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:31,089
...and the drycleaners
are out of this world.

9
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:37,133
That's not true. At Walgreens I was "over
the moon" for their store-brand antacids.

10
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:40,565
I see you're getting ready
for your Halloween party.

11
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,607
Yeah, it's my annual attempt
to meet women.

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,801
Ninth time's the charm.

13
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:51,573
Would you like me to help? I have a certain
je ne sais quoi when it comes to soirees.

14
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,148
Thanks, but I can't afford je ne sais quoi.

15
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,287
How much forjust quoi?

16
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,921
Don't worry about money,
I'll take care of it.

17
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,592
- Really?
- Yeah, you'll love it.

18
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:04,525
Ain't no party like a Koothra-party.
Ha-ha-ha.

19
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:07,756
You know what wasn't a party?
That hotel in Kazakhstan...

20
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:12,199
...they put you up in before the launch.
You'd think you'd get one porn channel.

21
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,839
Have you noticed Howard can take any topic
and use it to remind you he went to space?

22
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,307
Interesting hypothesis.

23
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,716
Let's apply the scientific method.
Perform an experiment.

24
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,680
Okay. Hey, Howard.

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,549
- Thoughts on where we should get dinner?
- Anywhere but the space station.

26
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:35,518
On a good day,
dinner was a bag full of meatloaf.

27
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:39,528
But, hey, you don't go there for the food,
you go there for the view.

28
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,466
That's fascinating.

29
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,464
I'm gonna see if I can duplicate it.

30
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:48,433
Howard, I've always thought the lemon
was an underrated fruit.

31
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,972
Care to weigh in?

32
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,335
Not really.

33
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,175
- Oh, well.
- People say the Soyuz capsule's a lemon...

34
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:02,483
Yeah, but, hey,
that baby got me to space and back.

35
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:36,852
Ladies' night at the Cheesecake Factory,
does it get any better than this?

36
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,683
I hope so.

37
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,490
Question: Do you think your husband's
fondness for turtle-necks...

38
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:47,097
...is an expression of longing
for his missing foreskin?

39
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,960
It's not getting any better.

40
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:58,703
Oh, it's Leonard.
He wants to go costume shopping later.

41
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,273
- I thought you liked Halloween.
- I do...

42
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:05,780
...he wants to go party at the comic store.
Lot of the guys there are kind of creepy.

43
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,610
- Like my husband?
- And my boyfriend?

44
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,858
I'm sorry, Amy, you were saying something
about Howard's foreskin?

45
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,187
Nice try, but you have to go to
that party because we're going.

46
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,094
I'm gonna go, it's just not my idea
of a good time.

47
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,031
Leonard does things he doesn't like
to make you happy.

48
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,802
Yeah, he's my boyfriend.
Isn't that, like, his job?

49
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,568
- Then what's yourjob?
- Letting him make me happy.

50
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,810
I just think, in relationships,
you get back what you put in.

51
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,381
That's not always true.

52
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,076
Last night I gave Sheldon
my best come-hither look...

53
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:45,553
...and he responded by explaining
how wheat came to be cultivated.

54
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,025
I guess I could probably try a little harder.

55
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,829
You could start
by taking an interest in his work.

56
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,033
- That's kind of a problem.
- Why?

57
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,464
Not really clear on what he does.

58
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,934
He's an experimental physicist.

59
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,663
Yeah, I'm not really clear
on what that means.

60
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:07,279
He takes hypotheses and designs protocols
to determine their accuracy.

61
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,971
Yeah, you're really just making it worse.

62
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,176
What kind of tea would you like?

63
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,857
I think I'm going to try
green tea mixed with lemon zinger.

64
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,856
Two tea bags in one cup?

65
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:23,928
You're not at a rave.

66
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,992
So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking...

67
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,338
...since this is our first Halloween
party as boyfriend and girlfriend...

68
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,769
...I thought it might be fun for us
to go in a couples' costume.

69
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,209
I couldn't agree more.

70
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,839
Really? I find that inconsistent
with everything I know about you.

71
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:51,187
Couples' costumes are one of
the few benefits of being in a relationship.

72
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,721
Now, imagine this:

73
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,687
You and I, entering Stuart's party...

74
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:01,330
...and all eyes turn to see America's
most beloved and glamorous couple:

75
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,899
- Yeah?
- R2-D2 and C-3P0.

76
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,331
Dibs on '3P0.

77
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:15,504
Sheldon, when I said couples' costume,
I meant, like, Romeo and Juliet...

78
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,545
...or Cinderella and Prince Charming.

79
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,480
Not two robots
from some silly movie I don't even like.

80
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,383
Okay.

81
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:28,224
I'm gonna let that slide because
I know you're hopped up on tea bags.

82
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,427
I make compromises for you all the time.

83
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,500
Just this once, can't we find something
that we're both happy with?

84
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:45,269
Fine. How about one of the most beguiling
and influential couples of the 20th century?

85
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,376
Hewlett and Packard.

86
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,876
Dibs on Hewlett.

87
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,243
You wanna be Hewlett?

88
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,190
- Anybody home?
- Hey, what are you doing here?

89
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,725
I just thought I'd stop by and say hello.

90
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,726
What a nice surprise.

91
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:10,369
- I don't think you've seen my lab before.
- I know, it's long overdue. What you doing?

92
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,231
Better not be building a robot girlfriend.

93
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:18,806
No. Although, Howard was making some
strides in that area until he met Bernadette.

94
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:20,611
- What, you're kidding?
- No.

95
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:26,080
Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box,
waiting for the phone to ring.

96
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:30,911
- What's going on in here?
- No, no, no, don't look in there.

97
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,820
- Is it a secret?
- No, it's a nitrogen laser.

98
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,790
It'll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.

99
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,098
Oh, might wanna put a sign on it.

100
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,397
There's a sign right there.

101
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,294
Ah, "Danger." Sure, sure.

102
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:46,936
So, what's that?

103
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,270
That is an integrated ion trap
and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.

104
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,638
Wow. High techie-techie.

105
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,105
What's this little box?

106
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,217
That is a pencil sharpener.

107
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,115
Oh, low techie-techie.

108
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,949
So, what are you working on now?

109
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,957
- It's actually pretty neat.
- Yeah?

110
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,323
It's a front-projected holographic display...

111
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:15,433
...combined with laser based
finger tracking. Here, I'll show you.

112
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,630
Put this pencil over here.

113
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:22,296
Sharp, thanks to the machine
we saw earlier.

114
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,602
Very good.

115
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:30,842
Then a laser will map
the reflective surface...

116
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,979
...and, voila.

117
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:38,687
Wow, that is amazing!

118
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,891
You know, there's a foundational idea
in string theory that...

119
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,794
...the whole universe may be a hologram.
- What do you mean?

120
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,897
Oh!

121
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,168
- Wow!
- Mm-hm.

122
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,337
The holographic principle suggests...

123
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,570
...that what we all experience every day
in three dimensions...

124
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:05,682
...may really just be information...

125
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:12,725
...on a surface located
at the farthest reaches of our cosmos.

126
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,660
So it's possible that our lives
are really just...

127
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,663
...acting out a painting
on the largest canvas in the universe.

128
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,330
Hmm.

129
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,802
What?

130
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:31,537
Sometimes I forget how smart you are.
Heh.

131
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,811
You should visit more often.

132
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:46,718
- What are you doing?
- Take off your clothes.

133
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,527
- What, here, now?
- You got a problem?

134
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:54,689
No, no. Just kind of crazy.
I've never fooled around in the lab before.

135
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,027
- Really? Never?
- Nope.

136
00:08:56,235 --> 00:09:01,332
I did have a shot with the Lisatronic,
but the extension cord wasn't long enough.

137
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:11,715
Before I forget, I'd like your opinion on the
menus I've prepared for the party.

138
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:16,150
The theme is "food that goes
bump in the night."

139
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:21,258
"Creature from
the Black Forest Ham Lagoon"?

140
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:25,063
On "sesame seed Bunzillas."

141
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,957
"Night of the Living Garlic Bread"?

142
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,900
It's funny because bread sounds like dead.

143
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,105
I'm sorry,
but these are just ordinary foods...

144
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,780
...with the names bent into tortured puns.

145
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,814
But the dishes themselves
are in no way Halloweeny.

146
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,316
Ooh, Hallow-weenies.

147
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:53,520
That's a good one. They'll pair nicely
with my Draculoni and Cheese.

148
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,293
How do I do it?

149
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:02,023
Reminds me. I was thinking of wearing
my NASAjumpsuit as a costume...

150
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,429
...but I realized everybody would be like:

151
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,903
"Where's your costume?
Why are you wearing work clothes?"

152
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,133
Hello, boys.

153
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,045
What are you smiling at?

154
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,806
Nothing.

155
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,284
- You know where there's a lot of nothing?
- Space.

156
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,491
Boy, it's nice to sleep in a bed
with gravity again.

157
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:36,228
Did I tell you about the night my retainer
floated out of my mouth into the airlock?

158
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,734
Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.

159
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,631
So here we are.

160
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:47,336
Just a couple of young newlyweds.
What to do?

161
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,447
What to do to you?

162
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,489
Astronaut Wolowitz reporting for booty.

163
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,751
Preparing thrusters.

164
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,061
We have liftoff.

165
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:13,704
- Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?
- Okay, we need to talk.

166
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,274
- What?
- Howie, I know you went to space...

167
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,238
...and I'm incredibly proud of you.

168
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:22,174
But you might wanna try and
not bring it up every minute.

169
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,906
I don't talk about it every minute.

170
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,018
Tonight at dinner you went on about it
for an hour straight.

171
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:32,688
What was I supposed to talk about?
We were eating at Johnny Rockets.

172
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,354
Just saying people
are getting a little tired of it.

173
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:43,366
So I did this amazing thing
and I'm never allowed to mention it?

174
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:49,098
Of course you can. But, maybe a good rule
would be to wait for people to bring it up.

175
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:54,405
Okay, heh. No problem.
It won't happen again.

176
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,648
- I love you.
- I love you too.

177
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,117
I can't tell you how many times...

178
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,153
...I dreamed I was in bed here...

179
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,416
...with you when I was...

180
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,322
You know...

181
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,064
What, I can't even point?

182
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:24,435
So, basically,
this is what's called mag-lev technology.

183
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:30,013
It uses powerful electromagnets to create
a force strong enough to overcome gravity.

184
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,583
- You hold this.
- Whoa, that's heavy.

185
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:37,187
- Oh, you don't have on any jewelry, do you?
- No, why?

186
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,483
Grad student forgot to take out
one of his piercings.

187
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,658
Now he's on a transplant list
waiting for a nipple his size.

188
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,061
Now, watch this.

189
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,194
Whoa.

190
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,397
That is very cool.

191
00:12:55,641 --> 00:13:01,136
Sometimes I like to turn this on
and pretend I'm the super-villain Magneto.

192
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,041
Getting a little less cool, Leonard.

193
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,474
What I really am is a very smart scientist.

194
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,745
Who understands
the mechanics of the universe.

195
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,321
And is wearing the sexy black
underwear you bought.

196
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,391
- There we go.
- Yeah.

197
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:20,662
So I thought the photo booth for the party
could be creepy, like a mummy's tomb...

198
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,562
...or they also have
the TARDIS from Doctor Who.

199
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,699
A TARDIS makes no sense.

200
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:29,932
A time machine from a science-fiction show
has nothing to do with Halloween.

201
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:35,443
That being said, if you don't get a TARDIS,
you stink and your party stinks.

202
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,046
- Do you have a preference?
- I don't care, get the TARDIS.

203
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:43,187
Yes! This party just became a major rager.

204
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,017
By the way, can I borrow
your bullwhip and fedora?

205
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,222
Yeah, sure, whatever.

206
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:53,797
I was thinking of dressing up as
Indiana Jones's mocha-skinned love child.

207
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,393
Indian Jones.

208
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,674
- Clever.
- What's wrong with you?

209
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,273
Nothing.

210
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:09,971
Howard, I've got a party to plan,
don't make me pull it out of you.

211
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:17,746
Here it is. Bernadette said you guys are
sick of me talking about my trip to space.

212
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,083
Is that true?

213
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,822
- No.
- Yes.

214
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,254
We seem to have different approaches here.

215
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:30,766
I was going for helpful honesty,
I have no idea what you're doing.

216
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,935
It's called being nice.

217
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,734
Okay, if you think being nice
will get him to shut up, I'll try it.

218
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,804
You know what, guys, never mind.

219
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:46,212
I just won't talk about the greatest
achievement of my life ever again.

220
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,784
Look at that, the problem solved itself.

221
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,960
Hello, boys.

222
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:05,998
What if we were to go
as dinner table favorites, salt and pepper?

223
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,303
You know salt makes me retain water...

224
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:12,238
...and my cousin, William, was ground
to death in a pepper factory accident.

225
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,647
Raggedy Ann and Andy?
I loved them growing up.

226
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:20,444
I don't think so. Those dolls represent
three things I don't care for:

227
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,986
Clowns, children, and raggedyness.

228
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,992
- I think it's a lost cause.
- No.

229
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:32,562
There are things that say to the world,
"I have a boyfriend and he's not made up."

230
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,391
Matching costumes, hickies, and sex tapes.

231
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,895
Pick one.

232
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,268
What's a hickey?

233
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,318
- How do I look?
- Fine.

234
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:06,658
Uh-oh. Is someone a little blue?

235
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:14,866
Come on, Howie, that's, like,
the funniest thing I've ever said in my life.

236
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,301
What do you say, you ready to go?

237
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,943
To tell you the truth,
I'm not really in the mood.

238
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:23,443
What are you talking about? It'll be fun,
your friends will be there.

239
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,879
Some friends. They all think I'm boring.

240
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,677
Maybe you should go without me.

241
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,756
No, if I'm there alone people might think
I'm just a really short person from Avatar.

242
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,320
I'm sorry, I just don't wanna go.

243
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:40,256
Hey, I just spent the last three hours
coloring myself blue.

244
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,459
I'm gonna be washing paint
out of my smurf for a month!

245
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,334
Fine.

246
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,200
Two weeks ago I was an astronaut.

247
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,569
Yeah, well, now you're a Smurf.
Keep walking.

248
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,883
Oh, my God, you guys look adorable!

249
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,484
Thanks, so do you.

250
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,779
- Slutty cop?
- No, sexy cop.

251
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:07,584
Slutty cop only came
with a skirt and two badges.

252
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,655
And Albert Einstein?

253
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:16,563
Ja. Und later she's going to arrest me
for going faster than the speed of light.

254
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:21,439
- I thought we said in the car, no accents.
- Sorry, officer.

255
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,809
Hello!

256
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:33,141
- It's a great party.
- Thank you.

257
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,445
The monster foods, they're really fun.

258
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:40,318
Oh, yes, thank you.
I like to think of fun things like that...

259
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:45,520
...because I'm fun,
I'm not clinically depressed at all.

260
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,993
Sheldon, get in here.

261
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,401
I should have picked hickey.

262
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,537
Hey, look at you guys!

263
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:06,148
I'm Raggedy Anne and he's Raggedy C-3P0.

264
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,846
It was a compromise. I lost.

265
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:15,188
Can you believe Stuart's walking around
taking credit for this party?

266
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,059
- Who cares?
- What do you mean, who cares?

267
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,788
Look what I pulled off here.
The DJ's on fire...

268
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,160
...there's a TARDIS photo booth
in the back...

269
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:28,135
...oh, my God, the food.
Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and Cheese.

270
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,840
You're right, the party's fantastic!
Tell me more.

271
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:34,638
I haven't heard enough about it,
because hearing about that never gets old!

272
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:38,476
- Is this about the space thing again?
- I'm not allowed to talk about it...

273
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:43,314
...but since you brought it up,
I went to space. Space, space, space!

274
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,347
Oh, Drinky Smurf!

275
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:51,392
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Great, now I'm in trouble.

276
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,187
You happy?

277
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,591
You, out!

278
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,098
You are being very rude.

279
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,599
No I'm not. They're all being rude,
and you're being rude.

280
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,001
Me? What did I do?

281
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:10,739
"Oh, Howie,
stop talking about space so much."

282
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,543
"Nobody likes it."

283
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,421
I don't sound like that.

284
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,724
You're supposed to be on my side.

285
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,986
I'm always on your side.

286
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,222
Then why are you trying to
take this away from me?

287
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:32,301
Being an astronaut is the coolest thing
I'm ever going to do...

288
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:36,572
...and if I stop talking about it
then I'm just...

289
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,206
Just what?

290
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:43,272
Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.

291
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:47,449
Plain old Howard Wolowitz
is the best guy I know.

292
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,582
- You're just saying that.
- No, I'm not.

293
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:54,383
I married him. On purpose.

294
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,228
Come here.

295
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,888
- I love you.
- I love you too.

296
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,407
Nothing to see here,
just sexy police business.

297
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,939
Just explaining the theory of relativity.

298
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,438
Twice.

299
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,553
Hey, what you watching?

300
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:29,250
I don't know.
Raj sent me some video of Buzz Aldrin.

301
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:33,993
Here you go, it's a Milky Way.

302
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:37,635
The Milky Way is a galaxy in space.

303
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,630
I've been in space.

304
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,373
Here's a Mars bar.

305
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:48,205
I'm an astronaut.

306
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,749
And this one's a MoonPie.

307
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,554
I walked on the Moon.

308
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,121
What have you done?

309
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,456
Okay, I get it.
