...all the giant missiles she wants.

309
00:18:02,702 --> 00:18:04,727
Are we talking
about women wanting penises?

310
00:18:04,904 --> 00:18:06,701
Because I'd like to weigh in.

311
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,208
Dr. Koothrappali,
would you care to join the conversation?

312
00:18:17,383 --> 00:18:19,783
Well, certainly.
I'd like to raise two points.

313
00:18:19,986 --> 00:18:23,752
Number one,
I think they are talking about penises.

314
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:30,056
And number two, these mimosas
are kicking my little brown ass.

315
00:18:32,698 --> 00:18:36,725
- I'd like to kick your little brown ass.
- What did I do?

316
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:40,233
Oh, I don't know. Maybe when you walk
into a hotel room...

317
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:43,204
...and you see a guy getting back
with his girlfriend...

318
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:47,472
...consider doing something other
than crawling into the adjoining bed.

319
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:50,514
I did. You said, "No Bridget Jones."

320
00:18:51,717 --> 00:18:56,211
PENNY: We weren't getting back together.
It was a one-time thing.

Excuse me, we're not taking comments
or questions from the audience just yet.

PENNY:
Oh, shut up, Sheldon.

323
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:05,156
Hi, bestie.

324
00:19:05,331 --> 00:19:06,821
PENNY:
Yeah, hi.

325
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:09,627
Why don't we see
if we can bring this back to topic?

326
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:12,794
- Let me ask you something, Bernie.
- I guess not.

327
00:19:13,105 --> 00:19:15,596
How would you feel
if you met my ex-girlfriend...

328
00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:18,335
...and she was like Angelina Jolie?

329
00:19:18,544 --> 00:19:21,741
Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic.

330
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,951
What, I'm not hot enough
for Angelina Jolie?

331
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,486
I'd like to weigh in here.

332
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,114
No.

333
00:19:35,194 --> 00:19:37,628
Why don't we open it up to Q&A
from the audience?

334
00:19:37,797 --> 00:19:40,357
PENNY: Yeah. Is there anybody
who can get me out of here...

335
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:43,160
...and back to Los Angeles tonight?

336
00:19:43,336 --> 00:19:45,861
GLENN:
I'm driving back to L.A. Tonight.

337
00:19:49,075 --> 00:19:50,372
Uh, Penny, that's Glenn.

338
00:19:50,576 --> 00:19:53,101
- Glenn, that's Penny.
- No!

- Sure.

346
00:20:30,216 --> 00:20:33,310
Are you bothered by the fact
that your former girlfriend left...

347
00:20:33,486 --> 00:20:37,115
...with what is probably the most
beautiful man I've ever seen in my life?

348
00:20:38,257 --> 00:20:40,054
No. Why do you ask?

349
00:20:40,226 --> 00:20:43,992
Because we're going
120 miles per hour.

I was spying the aluminum rims...
