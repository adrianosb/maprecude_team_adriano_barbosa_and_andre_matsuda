1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:03,884
So if you are considering
going into experimental physics...

2
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:05,817
...my door is always open.

3
00:00:05,989 --> 00:00:08,856
Again, I'm sorry that the demonstration
didn't quite work out.

4
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:10,287
Now we know what happens...

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,794
...when you accidentally spill peach Snapple
into a helium-neon laser.

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,667
The short answer is don't.

7
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:25,769
Now to tell you about
the Theoretical Physics Department...

8
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,432
...is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

9
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:34,206
- Dr. Cooper?
SHELDON: Forget it.

10
00:00:35,985 --> 00:00:37,612
Excuse me.

11
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:41,117
- Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.
SHELDON: It's a waste of time.

12
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,658
I might as well explain thermodynamics
to a bunch of Labradoodles.

13
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:51,161
If you don't do this,
I won't take you to the comic-book store.

14
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,128
Hello.

15
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,703
Nice work with the laser, by the way.

16
00:01:04,714 --> 00:01:07,080
Looking out at your fresh young faces...

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,515
...I remember when I too
was deciding my academic future...

18
00:01:10,687 --> 00:01:13,485
...as a lowly graduate student.

19
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,954
Of course, I was 14...

20
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:18,917
...and had achieved more
than you could ever hope to...

21
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:21,325
...despite my 9:00 bedtime.

22
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:26,662
Now, there may be one or two of you
in this room who has what it takes...

23
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,963
...to succeed in theoretical physics.

24
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:32,597
It's more likely that you will spend
your careers teaching fifth graders...

25
00:01:32,776 --> 00:01:36,212
...how to make papier-mâché volcanoes
with baking-soda lava.

26
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,276
Oh, good God.

27
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:42,543
In short, anyone who told you
that you would someday be able...

28
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,086
...to make any significant contribution
to physics played a trick on you.

29
00:01:46,256 --> 00:01:48,019
A cruel trick indeed.

30
00:01:50,727 --> 00:01:51,955
Any questions?

31
00:01:55,064 --> 00:01:57,157
Of course not.

32
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:00,060
I weep for the future of science.

33
00:02:00,236 --> 00:02:03,228
Now, if you'll excuse me,
the latest issue of <i>Batman</i> is out.

34
00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:05,774
Come, Leonard.

35
00:02:09,145 --> 00:02:12,137
Laser demonstration's looking
pretty good now, huh?

36
00:02:37,507 --> 00:02:38,838
I love this time of the year.

37
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:41,943
The leaves are turning.
There's a bracing chill in the air.

38
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:44,739
Plus, there's a whole new crop
of female grad students...

39
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:48,816
...about to put on just enough winter
weight to make them needy and vulnerable.

40
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,781
That's right, honey, have another calzone.
Daddy can wait.

41
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,161
Isn't there a policy
against dating graduate students?

42
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,662
No. If you can talk to them,
you can ask them out.

43
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:04,322
Damn. There's always a catch.

44
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,633
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Leslie.

45
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:11,103
So, dumb-ass, I heard you made
a grad student throw up last night.

46
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:16,739
The truth can indeed be a finger down
the throat of those unprepared to hear it.

47
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:19,640
But why should I cater
to second-rate minds?

48
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:23,349
Because first-rate minds
call you "dumb-ass."

49
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:27,086
Oh, yeah? Well--

50
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:29,191
You're a mean person.

51
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:31,721
Excuse me, Dr. Cooper?

52
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,562
I'm Ramona Nowitzki.
I was at your talk last night.

53
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:39,059
- I think you're just brilliant.
- Well, that is the prevailing opinion.

54
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,835
God, now I'm gonna throw up.

55
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:44,905
Howard Wolowitz,
Department of Engineering...

56
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:49,636
...co-designer of the International Space
Station's liquid-waste-disposal system.

57
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:53,713
Ew.

58
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,983
Dr. Cooper, I've read everything
you've published.

59
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:02,613
I liked your paper on grand unification
using string-network condensates...

60
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:04,555
...and was wondering how you determined
that three-dimensional string nets...

61
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:08,254
...provided a unified picture of fermions
and gauge bosons.

62
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:12,362
Amazing. An intelligent Labradoodle.

63
00:04:13,303 --> 00:04:14,634
Woof.

64
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:18,836
The fact is,
I'm quite close to a breakthrough...

65
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,943
...in showing how neutrinos emerge
from a string-net condensate.

66
00:04:22,111 --> 00:04:25,569
Oh, my God. That would change the way
we view the entire physical universe.

67
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:27,613
It's what I do.

68
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:31,379
You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz
liquid-waste-disposal system...

69
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:34,182
...is turning a few heads as well.

70
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,194
Again, ew.

71
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:45,229
You know, I'd love to hear more
about how you intend to add neutrinos.

72
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:48,928
- Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?
- I don't drink coffee.

73
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:51,073
I do. I love me a cup of Joe.

74
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:53,868
It doesn't have to be coffee.
How about dinner?

75
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,103
- I do eat dinner.
- Great. I know a terrific little Italian place.

76
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,376
I never eat in strange restaurants.
One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.

77
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:07,418
- Excuse me?
- Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.

78
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,753
Three tines is not a fork.
Three tines is a trident.

79
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:15,091
Forks are for eating,
tridents are for ruling the seven seas.

80
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:19,893
- What if I brought food to your place?
- That would be acceptable.

81
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,502
On Mondays, I eat Thai food.

82
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:25,300
Mee Krob and chicken satay
with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.

83
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:28,467
You got it. I already have your address.

84
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:33,907
What a nice girl.

85
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:37,350
Sheldon, do you have any idea
what just happened?

86
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,917
Yes. Apparently, I'm getting a free dinner.

87
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:48,959
Oh, yeah, no,
this thing's majorly out of order.

88
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:52,568
- See? I'm sorry.
- Okay. Guess I'm taking the stairs.

89
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:54,259
- Where you going?
- Four-A.

90
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,736
- Oh, are you here to see Leonard?
- No, Dr. Cooper.

91
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:00,603
Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

92
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,108
We're having dinner.

93
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,679
Sheldon Cooper?

94
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:11,411
Tall, thin, looks a little like
a giant praying mantis?

95
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:15,383
He is cute, isn't he?

96
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,085
PENNY:
Sheldon Cooper?

97
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,062
- Hi, Leonard.
- Hey, Ramona. Come on in.

98
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:26,701
Thanks. Where should I put this?

99
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:28,496
- The kitchen's fine.
- Okay.

100
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:30,903
- Hey. What are you doing?
- I need to see this.

101
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:32,405
Uh-huh.

102
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:36,209
The viewing area's right over there.

103
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:41,808
Sheldon, your girl-- Date-- Person--
Ramona's here.

104
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:45,412
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, sorry I'm late.

105
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:48,148
I got caught up reading the draft
of your latest paper.

106
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:52,124
Did you enjoy the footnote where I illustrate
mirror symmetry by likening it...

107
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:54,456
- ...to The Flash playing tennis with himself?
- So funny.

108
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,961
[LAUGHS]

109
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:59,227
The idea that you might be able
to incorporate gravity...

110
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:03,361
...I have to tell you,
I found it physically exhilarating.

111
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:07,409
My hypotheses tend to have that effect.

112
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,776
I'm sorry I didn't bring enough
for your friends.

113
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:14,348
I assumed we were going to be alone.

114
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:19,644
Oh. Yeah. No, we were just going.

115
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:21,289
To watch, right?

116
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:27,529
- No. Come on now. We're going out.
- Oh, come on. We'll be quiet.

117
00:07:27,897 --> 00:07:29,057
Come on, let's go.

118
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,894
Okay, you two.

119
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:36,895
You just have a nice whatever this is.

120
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:44,612
Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none
of my business, but I just-- I have to ask.

121
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,543
What's Sheldon's deal?

122
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:53,214
- What do you mean, "deal"?
- You know, like, what's his deal?

123
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,552
Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?

124
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:01,754
Honestly, we've been operating
under the assumption that he has no deal.

125
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:04,593
- Oh, come on, everybody has a deal.
- Not Sheldon.

126
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:09,295
Over the years, we've formulated many
theories about how he might reproduce.

127
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:13,373
I'm an advocate of mitosis.

128
00:08:14,343 --> 00:08:15,674
I'm sorry?

129
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:19,110
I believe, one day, Sheldon will eat
an enormous amount of Thai food...

130
00:08:19,282 --> 00:08:22,308
...and split into two Sheldons.

131
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:27,180
On the other hand, I think Sheldon
might be the larval form of his species.

132
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:29,620
He'll spin a cocoon
and emerge two months later...

133
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:32,260
...with moth wings and an exoskeleton.

134
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:36,422
Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.

135
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:41,763
- Hey, do you wanna hang out with us?
- Well, what are you guys gonna do?

136
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:44,197
Uh....

137
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:47,035
My mom's making a brisket tonight.

138
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:50,979
- The one with the little onions?
- Yeah.

139
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:58,286
Yeah, I'm busy. So good night.

140
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:01,686
Her loss. Let's go.

141
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:05,455
Brisket party. B to the R to the l-S-K.

142
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,855
To the E to the T to the....

143
00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:12,330
- Ooh--
- Don't.

144
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:20,201
- Hey. Aren't you having breakfast?
- Yes.

145
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:24,843
Are you experimenting
with nutritional suppositories again?

146
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:28,414
Not in these pants.

147
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:33,748
- So how'd it go with Ramona last night?
- Oh, great.

148
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:35,914
She's smart, insightful.

149
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:40,085
She has a very unique way of,
you know, revering me.

150
00:09:42,064 --> 00:09:46,865
- Here's your spinach-mushroom omelet.
- Thank you.

151
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,468
- Did anyone touch it?
- Gloves were worn by everyone involved.

152
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,834
I was vigilant.

153
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:55,608
Ramona pointed out
that I've been wasting 20 minutes a day...
