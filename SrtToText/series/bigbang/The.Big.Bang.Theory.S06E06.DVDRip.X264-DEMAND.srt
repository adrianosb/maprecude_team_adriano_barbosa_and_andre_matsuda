1
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:08,265
It's great to be in the Empire today

2
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:13,037
It's great to be in the Empire today

3
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,840
We got everything

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,007
Try to keep up, Howard. I'm killing it.

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:23,551
Yeah, I wish we looked as cool
dancing in clubs as we do right now.

6
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,952
Don't worry, this is exactly how you look
when you're dancing in clubs.

7
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,362
You're welcome, ladies.

8
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,089
Paradigm-shifting news, gentlemen.

9
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:38,596
Dude, I was about
to Bollywood this bitch.

10
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,703
Earlier today, I invited
Professor Stephen Hawking to join me...

11
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,606
...in the popular online game
"Words With Friends."

12
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:52,045
Moments ago, he accepted my request.
Do you understand what that means?

13
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,311
That somewhere, right now,
Stephen Hawking is saying:

14
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:58,719
"Damn it. I meant to click 'no'."

15
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,487
I'll walk you through it.

16
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,165
The game is not called
"Words With Strangers."

17
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,391
No. It is not even called
"Words With Acquaintances."

18
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:12,901
It is called "Words With..."

19
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:18,604
I'm not finishing your sentence.
You pulled the plug on my funk.

20
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:24,011
"Friends." It's "Words With Friends."
Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are.

21
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,377
Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide.

22
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:30,317
I'll have everything I've ever wanted
since I was 6 years old.

23
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,514
That's really nice. I'm happy for you.

24
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,021
And I'm happy for you too.

25
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,196
You are now friends with someone who
is officially friends with Stephen Hawking.

26
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,797
Enjoy it, boys. You may have peaked.

27
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,668
I know Stephen Hawking. I worked with him.

28
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,272
Yeah, and if they ever come out
with a game called...

29
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,773
..."Words With People You Once
Worked With," you'll be off to the races.

30
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,344
Sheldon, I don't think
this actually means that...

31
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,046
Hold that thought.
Professor Hawking has made a move.

32
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,615
Boy, oh, boy.

33
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,219
It's only a matter of time
before we're coming up...

34
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,686
...with fun nicknames for each other.

35
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:09,454
I'll be Coop. Yeah. He'll be Wheels.

36
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,628
If he's okay with that.

37
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,457
All right.

38
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,997
Crank up the a.c., boys.
It's gonna get hot in here.

39
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,539
Young man, young man
Get yourself off the ground

40
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,397
So I was taking a shower
this morning and when I got out...

41
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,233
...I started to dry off
with what I thought was a towel...

42
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,467
...but turned out to be
Howard's mom's underwear.

43
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:04,105
I had to take another shower.

44
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,082
It wasn't enough.

45
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,250
Nothing will ever be enough.

46
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,593
I once looked in Sheldon's
underwear drawer. He yelled at me.

47
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:21,524
But now I know what it looks like,
and he can never take that away.

48
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,635
- There's a book under here.
- Oh. I'll get that.

49
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,067
- I got it. I got it.
- No, no, it's okay.

50
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,902
- Why do you have a history textbook?
- No, it's... It's not a big deal.

51
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,567
Just taking a class
at the Pasadena Community College.

52
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,543
That's great. I didn't know
you wanted to go back to school.

53
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,046
It's just one history class.

54
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,448
Look, I didn't finish college,
so I thought I would give it a try.

55
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,919
Not to mention your acting career
is going south like Sherman.

56
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,519
Read about it in your book.

57
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,997
Why would you be embarrassed
to tell us?

58
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,464
I'm not. I didn't want anyone to know.
I haven't told Leonard yet.

59
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,899
- Why wouldn't you tell Leonard?
- Because it's me going back to school.

60
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,905
And he's gonna be all,
"You can do it," and, "How can I help?"

61
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,543
And, "I'm so proud of you." Ugh.

62
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:09,080
I can't believe you could keep
something like that from him.

63
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,047
You guys have got to be
the weirdest couple I know.

64
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,923
Really?

65
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,256
You can't think of anyone weirder?

66
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,223
I can...

67
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,834
...but she's sitting right there.

68
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,871
Yes. I play the word "quiver"...

69
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,104
...with a triple letter
and a double word score for 72 points.

70
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,947
That'll let the air out of your tires,
Hawking.

71
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,220
Wow, my boyfriend is friends
with Stephen Hawking...

72
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,789
...and my new dandruff shampoo
doesn't smell like tar.

73
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,596
Everything really is coming up Amy.

74
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,132
It is glorious.

75
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,392
One of the greatest intellects
of our time...

76
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,002
...has agreed to engage with me
in a gentlemanly battle of wits.

77
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:11,165
And I'm spanking him so hard, his grad
students won't be able to sit down.

78
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:16,107
You know, when one male dominates
another, his testosterone level rises.

79
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,076
- What's your point?
- It's exciting to think...

80
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,379
...you might be getting
a testosterone level.

81
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:31,520
Ooh! My friend Stephen just played
the word "act" for 18 points.

82
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,427
That's right, I call him Stephen now.

83
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,194
Because I checked,
and he was not okay with Wheels.

84
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,404
Oh. You could turn his "act" into "extract"...

85
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,542
...and it would be for double points.

86
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,211
Amy, why would you give me a word?

87
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,347
Now if I play "extract,"
it would be cheating.

88
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,017
- Sorry.
- Although, I could play...

89
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:56,348
...the completely unrelated
and better word "extract."

90
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,183
Ethical conundrum avoided.

91
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,853
Thanks, brain.

92
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,166
Spaghetti okay?

93
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,165
It's crunchy.

94
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,304
Just the way I like it.

95
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,708
Yeah, I don't think
the water was really boiling.

96
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,872
- It's great, I love it.
- Ha, ha.

97
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,673
Okay, listen, there's something
I need to tell you.

98
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:26,376
I've been thinking about
going back to school for a while now.

99
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,885
So a couple months ago, I started taking
a history class at the community college.

100
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,048
Oh. That's great. Great, great, great.

101
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,057
- Why wait so long to tell me?
- I just...

102
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,025
I don't want you to make
a big deal out of it.

103
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,721
Why do you think that?
I get it, you're taking one class.

104
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,766
It's nice. Maybe if it goes well,
you take another, you enroll full time.

105
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:46,393
Ooh. Be sure to keep an eye on which
credits transfer to a four-year college.

106
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,938
You're making a big deal.

107
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,270
Sorry. You know, whatever.
Psh. It's all good.

108
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,973
Anyway, that's it.
I just thought you should know.

109
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,117
Am I allowed to ask
how the class is going?

110
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,013
It's good. We've been talking
about the origins of slavery.

111
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,984
- I turn in my first paper tomorrow.
- I can help with that.

112
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,684
There's lots of perspectives to take.
Economic, sociological, political...

113
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,418
Hey, this is my paper.

114
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,530
And my perspective
is that slavery is bad.

115
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:19,096
And my professor's black,
so I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.

116
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:23,631
- Can I take a look?
- No, Leonard. This is my thing.

117
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,812
- Okay. I get it.
- Thank you.

118
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,844
It's like when I started doing chin-ups.

119
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,142
I didn't want you to see
until I could do one.

120
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,115
FYI, really close.

121
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,855
Thank you. Now, behave yourself
and eat your dinner.

122
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,960
And if you're lucky,
you get to sleep with a college girl.

123
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,120
Really? I went to four years of college
and five years of grad school.

124
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,492
That never happened once.

125
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:53,369
I think the next time I have to speak
to a call center in India...

126
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,007
...I'm going to try using
an American accent.

127
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,635
Why?

128
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:04,647
Because when I use my regular voice,
I feel like I'm making fun of them.

129
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,684
That's ridiculous. Not to mention,
your American accent is terrible.

130
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,017
Dude, my accent is brilliant.

131
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,559
Hey, my snow-white
American friends, let's put some cow meat...

132
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,994
...on the barbecue and eat it
until we're all obese.

133
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,093
This is what you sound like:

134
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,794
"I think I'm talking in an American accent...

135
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:30,033
...but it really sounds like
I'm wearing a set of giant dentures."

136
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,037
Sheldon, do I really sound like that?

137
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,177
Tell him he sounds like that.

138
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,847
Sheldon, you okay?

139
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,016
It's been three days.

140
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:45,019
Why hasn't Stephen Hawking
played a word?

141
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,951
The guy's a genius. Maybe you weren't
challenging enough for him.

142
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,721
Not challenging?
I was humiliating the man.

143
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,900
I was thinking of writing a book called...

144
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:58,935
...A Brief History of the Time I Made
Stephen Hawking Cry Like a Little Girl.

145
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:03,375
There's the problem.
You can't beat Hawking like that.

146
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,841
He hates to lose.
Everyone knows the guy's a big baby.

147
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,879
I mean, forget the wheelchair,
he should be in a stroller.

148
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,583
Really?

149
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,585
One time when I was working with him...

150
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,247
...he said that Johnny Depp
was in The Matrix.

151
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,222
I told him he was wrong,
but he kept insisting.

152
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,726
So I looked it up online and showed him.

153
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:31,364
Well, the next day, he had a pizza party,
and everyone got invited but me.

154
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:33,996
And then he was all:

155
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:38,371
"Your invitation
must've gotten lost in the matrix."

156
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,741
Good Lord. What have I done?

157
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,942
Good Lord, what have I done?

158
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,388
Terrible.

159
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,759
All right, hotshot, let's hear your Indian.

160
00:09:55,962 --> 00:10:01,594
I can't sit on that elephant.
My ass is on fire from eating all this curry.

161
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,798
Okay, yeah, that's pretty good.

162
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:33,295
Please be good, please be good.

163
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,133
Uh-huh.

164
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,872
Uh-huh...

165
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,340
Okay.

166
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,044
She writes like she cooks.

167
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,681
Play. Play.

168
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,256
Play. Play.

169
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,392
- Play.
- What are you doing?

170
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,459
Trying to use a Jedi mind trick
to control Stephen Hawking.

171
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,730
Play. Play.

172
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,468
He must be wearing a tinfoil hat
or something.

173
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,773
I did a bad thing.

174
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,242
- Does it affect me?
- No.

175
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,574
Then suffer in silence.

176
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,484
Play. Play.

177
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,416
Play.

178
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,918
Stephen Hawking. Stephen Hawking.

179
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,854
Stephen Hawking.

180
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,423
Penny started taking a class.
She wrote a paper.

181
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,589
She didn't want me to read it.
I went behind her back. I read it.

182
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,599
Stephen Hawking hates me.

183
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:45,930
I don't know what to do.

184
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:49,302
The paper's terrible.
But if I tell her, she'll know that I read it...

185
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,009
...and she'll get really mad.

186
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,236
I was beating him so bad
he doesn't wanna be friends anymore.

187
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,848
Why does everyone love me
except Stephen Hawking?

188
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,610
Is it possible we're having
two different conversations?

189
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,085
How would I know?
I'm not listening to you.

190
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,285
Hang on.

191
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,391
Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.
Chess clock.

192
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,963
We each get five minutes
to talk about our problems.

193
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,330
We'll take turns.
Each turn will consist of a statement...

194
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,970
...and a helpful response from the friend.

195
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,730
Begin.

196
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,910
I humiliated Stephen Hawking
in a game of "Words With Friends."

197
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,739
He stopped playing.
And now we're not friends anymore.

198
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,147
He's probably busy.
You're worried about nothing.

199
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,648
Give it a couple more days.
I'm sure he'll play...

200
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,753
...and you'll see that everything's fine.

201
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,287
My turn. I can't let Penny
hand in a bad paper...

202
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,984
...but how do I tell her it's bad
without letting her know that I read it?

203
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,252
Hmm.

204
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,657
Beats me. Now...

205
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,959
I know Hawking's not busy,
because I can see...

206
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,966
...he's playing other people right now.

207
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:55,596
Maybe since you're so good,
he's taking his time to meet the challenge.

208
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:59,300
- I want Penny to enjoy...
- Wolowitz told me he's a big baby.

209
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,572
Yeah, I didn't know that,
and I played "extract" for 82 points.

210
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,012
Oh, it's all Amy's fault.
She told me to play it.

211
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,744
I have got to cut her loose.

212
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,081
Sheldon, I wasn't done talking.

213
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,623
She hands in the paper tomorrow.
I know I could help her.

214
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,796
And she's my girlfriend.
I should be allowed to help her.

215
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:21,023
- Why aren't I allowed to help her?
- I hear you, brother.

216
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:25,035
No, you need to give me some advice.

217
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,898
Uh, fine. Women, huh?

218
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,643
Specific to my situation.

219
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:33,869
Blond women, huh?

220
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,980
- Empathetic.
- Sucks to be you.

221
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,209
I quit!

222
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:45,622
Leonard, wait, no.
I listened to your dumb thing.

223
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,118
Leonard, come back.
Leonard, come back.

224
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,419
Leonard, come back.

225
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,993
- What?
- Oh, of course.

226
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,165
It only works on the weak-minded.

227
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,840
Good morning, sunshine.

228
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,208
Leonard, it's 8 a.m.

229
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,406
It's like the middle of the night.

230
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,143
I know, but I have to go to work,
and I made you breakfast.

231
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,585
Oh, wow, that's so sweet.

232
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,691
- Hey, what's this?
- Before you open that...

233
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,591
Um, are you familiar with the story
of the shoemaker and the elves?

234
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,925
Elves? Come on, Leonard,
it's too early for Lord of the Rings.

235
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,759
No, no.

236
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,931
Listen, once upon a time,
there was this shoemaker.

237
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:38,109
And when he went to bed at night,
elves would sneak in...

238
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,370
...and they would make
all these amazing shoes for him.

239
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,741
And when the shoemaker
woke up in the morning...

240
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,816
...he would be super happy.

241
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,542
Not mad at the elves at all.

242
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,312
Open it.

243
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,718
Okay. Ahem.

244
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,727
"An examination of the economic,
cultural and political roots of slavery...

245
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,764
...in the Old South, 1619 to 1865."

246
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,298
What the hell is this?

247
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,736
Don't ask me, a little elf did it. Ha, ha.

248
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,308
So let me get this straight.

249
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:16,242
You just assumed my paper would be bad,
so you wrote one for me?

250
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:19,645
- I assumed it would be good. Then I read it.
- What?

251
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:24,812
Well, I mean, it was good. There were just
a few things that needed a little polishing.

252
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,517
- Well, you changed every word.
- That's not true. Uh...

253
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,285
"Slavery."

254
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:36,425
Uh, "1619." Your name at the top.
That's all you.

255
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,264
You are such an ass.

256
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,531
This is why I didn't wanna tell you
I was taking a class.

257
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,333
Please, don't be upset. I just...

258
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,604
I didn't want you ending up
with a bad grade and get discouraged...

259
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,112
...and give up on the idea
of going back to school.

260
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,342
Right, because me being in school
is so important to you.

261
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,851
That way, you wouldn't have to be dating
someone who's only a waitress.

262
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,024
Come on, you know that's not true.

263
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,523
Do I? Listen to me.
I need to do this on my own.

264
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,888
If I fail, I fail. If I pass, I pass.
Do you get it?

265
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,691
- I'm sorry, I was just trying to help.
- Yeah, well, next time, don't.

266
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,569
Oh. And since you like stories so much...

267
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,034
...this is not the shoemaker
and the elves, okay?

268
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,037
This is give a man a fish, he eats it.

269
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,335
Teach a man to fish,
he sells it or something.

270
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,571
Whatever, I don't know. It's just
a lot better than what you did, you big jerk!

271
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:31,311
- You ever hear back from Hawking?
- No.

272
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,514
It would appear as if I've lost him.

273
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,853
Stupid brain.

274
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,594
- It'll be okay.
- How can it be okay?

275
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,064
Stephen Hawking's a genius
and he talks like a robot.

276
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,295
That's everything
I've ever wanted in a friend.

277
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:52,004
Yeah, but if he's a sore loser,
maybe you're better off without him.

278
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,675
You're right.

279
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,575
I guess I just have to make lemonade
out of the two of you.

280
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,784
Ah! He played. He played.

281
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,214
Coop and Rolling Thunder
are together again.

282
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,218
He was okay with that nickname.

283
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,026
- So now all you have to do is let him win.
- Yeah, way ahead of you.

284
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:18,363
I will play the word "at"
for two measly points...

285
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,095
...throwing the game
and thus securing my friendship...

286
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,741
...with the smartest man in the world.

287
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,744
What are you waiting for? Hit send.

288
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:36,546
I can't. Losing on purpose
is intellectually dishonest.

289
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,589
- So don't do it.
- Oh, but I wanna be Hawking's friend.

290
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,727
- So do it.
- But if I do, I'll be a phony.

291
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:46,091
A sellout. A Hollywood poser.

292
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,896
Then don't do it.

293
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,129
I won't. This feels right.

294
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,169
My mother always said,
"To thine own self be true."

295
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,567
Good for you.

296
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,300
She also told me that every animal
in the world got on one boat.

297
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:02,106
So, what does she know? And send.

298
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,614
Oh. Hey. Haven't heard from you
in a couple days.

299
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,756
- You still mad at me?
- Nope.

300
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:15,825
I have no reason to "B" mad at you.

301
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,089
Minus.

302
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,933
- Wow.
- That's right. On my paper.

303
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,002
Not yours, mine, you punk-ass elf.

304
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,907
I don't know what to say.

305
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,235
Hmm. How about:

306
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,004
"Gee, Penny, you're smarter than I thought.

307
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,808
You may be the one in school,
but I'm the one who learned a lesson.

308
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,644
I'm so stupid, Penny. Duh."

309
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,689
She sounds exactly like you.

310
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,629
How'd it go with Leonard?

311
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,462
I don't think he'll be making that mistake again.

312
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,797
- Good.
- So I know this goes without saying...

313
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,338
...but if either of you tell Leonard
you helped me rewrite this paper...

314
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,670
...I'll beat you both
with a bag of oranges.

315
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,444
- Okay.
- Understood.

316
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,978
Now, ladies.
We got a B-minus on this paper.

317
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:14,141
I think if we put our heads together,
on the next one, we could get an A.

318
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,083
But we got you a B-minus on purpose
to make it believable.

319
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,346
Believable?

320
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:20,851
You saying I'm not smart?

321
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,549
- You're smart.
- No, no.

322
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,690
That's better.

323
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,530
I feel like I'm in high school again.

324
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:33,762
Yeah, doing the prom queen's homework
so she'll like us.

325
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,730
I know.

326
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,534
It's finally working.

327
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,219
It's Stephen Hawking.

328
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,920
Answer it. I wanna hear.

329
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,124
Professor Hawking,
how nice of you to call.

330
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:03,563
Hello. I really enjoyed our game, Dr. Cooper.

331
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:09,173
- Oh, me too.
- Or should I say, Dr. Loser?

332
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,406
Ha-ha-ha.

333
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:20,345
Yes, congratulations.
You won fair and square.

334
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,281
Very impressive, sir.

335
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:26,753
- Do you like brainteasers?
- Oh, I love brainteasers.

336
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:32,695
What does Sheldon Cooper
and a black hole have in common?

337
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,058
They both suck.

338
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,905
Neener-neener.
