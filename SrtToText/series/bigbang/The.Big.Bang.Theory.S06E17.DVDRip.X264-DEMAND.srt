1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:04,126
Previously on The Big Bang Theory:

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,295
Can I have your attention, please?

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,907
We're all here tonight because
we have no one to be with.

4
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,980
We gotta stop defining our self-worth...

5
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,412
...by whether or not we're in a relationship.

6
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,411
We are a community...

7
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:25,081
...and as long as we have each other,
we're never truly alone.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,021
That was cool. What you said.

9
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,563
Thank you.

10
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:41,936
Uh, would you like to, uh,
get a cup of coffee?

11
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,166
Okay.

12
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,575
Later, losers!

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,855
So then I went to Cambridge,
which was wonderful...

14
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:01,517
...not only because it's a good school,
but because it totally looks like Hogwarts.

15
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:06,722
That's where I fell in love with astronomy,
and now I'm an astrophysicist at Caltech.

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,463
So I guess you could say, uh,
Raj is my name, and stars are my game.

17
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:15,937
And rhyming is also my game.

18
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,078
So, uh, two games.

19
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:23,245
Uh, anyway, that's enough about me,
I want to hear everything about you.

20
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,275
I have to go to the bathroom.

21
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,312
I go to the bathroom too.

22
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,652
Sometimes more frequently
than I care to admit.

23
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,487
I've had it checked out, it's nothing.

24
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,498
This is going great.

25
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:45,064
Mm. Can I have a refill on my chai tea?

26
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:48,969
Ah, yes, I have a good feeling about this.

27
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,172
I should have bought condoms.

28
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:26,137
Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

29
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,770
Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents:
Fun With Flags.

30
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,787
My apologies
that this episode is coming late.

31
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:39,447
I did shoot one last week
in honor of Black History Month...

32
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:42,720
...but I was informed by my roommate
that my spot-on portrayal...

33
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:47,195
...of George Washington Carver
could be considered "wildly racist."

34
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,869
My heart goes out to the members
of the African-American community...

35
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,133
...who, like me,
have been kept down by the man.

36
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:02,671
Now, Fun With Flags
is not just for the flag aficionado...

37
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,908
...it's also for the flag novice.

38
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:09,885
So to help me with that, please welcome
my friend, neighbor and flag virgin...

39
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,183
...not a real virgin.

40
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,853
She's had coitus many times.

41
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,231
Sometimes within earshot
of this flag enthusiast.

42
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,595
Once while he was trying to watch
The Incredibles.

43
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,037
Penny.

44
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,107
Hello.

45
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,538
So, Penny, I understand...

46
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,408
...you'd like to learn more about flags.
- I can't tell you how many times...

47
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:39,916
...I've been at a party, everyone's talking
about flags and I just couldn't join in.

48
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,180
Well, you came to the right place.

49
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,919
I'm sorry, can we just pause for a minute?

50
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:51,889
What's wrong?

51
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,626
I think it'd look more natural
if you talked to me instead of the camera.

52
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,563
You know, like a real conversation?

53
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,796
It's something we work on
in acting class.

54
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,030
Interesting.

55
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:06,137
A few people in the Comments section
have said that my delivery is robotic.

56
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,279
Perhaps that isn't the compliment
it sounds like.

57
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:15,145
Let's try it again. Maybe this time
you could work on body language a bit.

58
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,415
When you're hunched like that,
you're shutting the audience out.

59
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:22,425
But when you're relaxed and open,
you're inviting them in.

60
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,395
Right.

61
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,529
And which one do I want?

62
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:29,659
Let's try open.

63
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,929
If our friend the flag has taught me anything,
it's to go where the wind takes you.

64
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,667
As long as you remain
firmly attached to a rigid pole.

65
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,039
And action.

66
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:55,986
So, Penny, what sort of flag questions
keep you awake at night?

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,127
Um, well, I'm from Nebraska.

68
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,669
So, what can you tell me
about the state flag?

69
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,999
Gosh, Penny...

70
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:13,312
...what did you have for breakfast,
a big glass of good question juice?

71
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,650
The Nebraska state flag
is simply the state seal on a field of blue.

72
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,495
Spread your legs, invite them in.

73
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:44,072
I'm telling you, something's wrong.
I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble.

74
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,677
Jeez, how close were you
before we got married?

75
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,746
Don't look under that rock.

76
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,217
- Raj, you okay?
- You in there?

77
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,409
Go away.

78
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,315
- Come on, buddy, open up.
- We're worried about you.

79
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,482
Oh, just because I stop going to work
and answering my phone...

80
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,254
...you think something bad happened?

81
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,624
Maybe something good happened.

82
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,661
Did something good happen?

83
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,928
Of course not, nothing good ever happens!

84
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,374
Whoa.

85
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,638
- What?
- Just whoa.

86
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,519
Smells pretty ripe in here.

87
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,553
You kind of feel it in your eyes.

88
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,786
Raj, what's going on?

89
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,263
I was humiliated by yet another woman.

90
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:43,630
You didn't kill her and chop her up,
that's not what we're smelling, right?

91
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,397
No, I took her for coffee...

92
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,939
...and she snuck out the bathroom window
to get away from me.

93
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,633
Oh, you poor baby.

94
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,142
I went and looked.

95
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,303
It was a high and tiny window.

96
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,315
She must've been very motivated.

97
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,709
I'm sorry, that's awful.

98
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:05,790
- But come on, you gotta shake it off.
- You can't stay in your apartment...

99
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,483
...for the rest of your life.
- Why not?

100
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:12,130
With online shopping and overnight
delivery, I can get anything I want.

101
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:16,324
Look, I just ordered a case
of Dinty Moore beef stew...

102
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:19,471
...and two live lobsters on Amazon.

103
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,672
- Lobsters overnight?
- You're kidding. Let me see.

104
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:27,211
Well, I'll be. Look, you can throw in
a couple steaks and have a surf and turf.

105
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,510
Surf and turf sounds good.
See if they have corn on the cob.

106
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,819
Guys, we're trying to get
him out of here, not you in.

107
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,791
You're wasting your time.
Just please, leave me alone.

108
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,525
- Now what?
- I don't know.

109
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,862
We could go to Red Lobster
and talk about it.

110
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,040
We're all thinking it. I just had
the decency to wait for him to leave.

111
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,352
- Hello, Sheldon.
- Hello.

112
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,186
How's the final stage of your
nicotine addiction study going?

113
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,889
Fine.

114
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,688
Just hold on.
Mommy's on the phone!

115
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:22,133
Sorry, we've cut the monkeys down
to one cigarette a day...

116
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,064
...so things are a little intense.

117
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:30,201
Makes me miss my marijuana-abusing
flatworms. Those guys were mellow.

118
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,208
Good news, uh, the latest episode
of Fun With Flags is online.

119
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:39,078
- Oh, that's right. How'd it go with Penny?
- Much better than I expected.

120
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:43,847
She even gave me some helpful tips
about acting and body language.

121
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,081
Watch.

122
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,326
Welcome to my world.

123
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,186
Not welcome to my world.

124
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,693
Welcome.
Not welcome.

125
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,860
Subtle but powerful.

126
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,201
I know, I'm still learning to control it.

127
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,033
Did you tell Penny how helpful she was?

128
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:06,603
Why would I do that?

129
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,071
Because she's your friend
and she did a nice job.

130
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:11,876
I'm sure she'd like to hear it.

131
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,244
All right.

132
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,189
I didn't mean now. Hello?

133
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:24,628
Yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette.
Well, I'd like a normal boyfriend. Deal with it.

134
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,697
Oh. Hey, what's up?

135
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,063
Um...

136
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,264
You need me to shut the door
so you can do your knocking thing?

137
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,135
No. I didn't start yet. It's fine.

138
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,279
Okay. So, what do you need?

139
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:46,146
Well, I was thinking about
you helping me out last night.

140
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:47,949
Penny.

141
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:54,081
And I just wanted to tell you, Penny...

142
00:09:55,661 --> 00:10:00,257
...that the answer to the question,
"Who did a great job?" is you.

143
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,098
Penny.

144
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,001
- Really?
- Yes.

145
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,436
You were very natural
in front of the camera...

146
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,974
...and I found your suggestions
extremely helpful.

147
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,010
Oh, sweetie, you just made my day.

148
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,507
Okay.

149
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:21,449
My acting class is putting on a play Friday.
I can put you and Amy on the guest list.

150
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,881
Oh, that sounds terrible.
Why would I want to do that?

151
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:30,894
That's right,
they're no good without the lighter.

152
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,622
So much for your advice
on complimenting Penny.

153
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,324
Why, what happened?

154
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,699
She tried to rope us into going to her
acting class to see a play.

155
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:43,932
Don't worry, luckily I had the good sense
to drown that kitten in the river.

156
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:49,545
Sheldon, that's very rude.
She helped you with your show.

157
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,707
The right thing to do is reciprocate
by going to see her play.

158
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,787
Oh, so many crazy rules.

159
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,684
That better be Tootsie Rolls
you're throwing at me!

160
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:06,893
Penny.

161
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,328
Penny.

162
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,026
Penny.
Oh, yeah, much better.

163
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:13,896
What?

164
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,634
Amy pointed out to me that
since you did something nice for me...

165
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,301
...I'm obligated to do something
nice for you.

166
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:24,374
So, yes, I'll go to your dopey play.

167
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,818
- Hey, I don't want you to go anymore.
- Why not?

168
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,252
Go because you want to,
not because you have to.

169
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,324
Oh, dear Lord, more rules.
Where does it stop?

170
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,993
Can I want to go
because I have to want to go?

171
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,394
- Okay, do whatever you want.
- Yeah, but, no, wait.

172
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:47,869
Do whatever I want
or whatever I have to want?

173
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,539
Oh, for God's sake, just come to the play.

174
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,837
All right.

175
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,173
I don't want to
but at least that makes sense.

176
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:05,717
You know, I haven't seen Raj
in several days.

177
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,359
Is he no longer a part of our social group?

178
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,720
And if so, should we be
interviewing for a replacement?

179
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,763
Perhaps this time we go Latin.

180
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,735
He's just decided
he's never leaving his apartment again.

181
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,309
Oh. Brilliant.
I've been itching to pull that trigger.

182
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,079
He's upset because
he can't get anywhere with women.

183
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,413
Would it help if I gave him some pointers?

184
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,525
I'm just funning you. Ha, ha.

185
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:50,429
Hi. I don't know if you remember me
but I was here the other night at your party.

186
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,037
Oh, yeah, you left with Raj.

187
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,608
- Yeah.
- You're the one?

188
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,405
Let me tell you something.

189
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:02,570
That guy you blew off
happens to be my best friend.

190
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,340
Okay? He was devastated.

191
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,108
Sorry.

192
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,843
Can you just give him this?

193
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:09,984
Okay.

194
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:14,286
But I gotta warn you,
Raj is a proud, passionate man.

195
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,588
If you go running out on him again...

196
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:21,597
...you're only gonna get like three or four
more chances before you are history.

197
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:28,535
Come on, she came back.
This is good news. You should celebrate.

198
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,607
I don't want to celebrate.

199
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,610
Not even a little?

200
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,946
We could have a pants party.
Go put some on.

201
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,184
Why would I want her number?
I want nothing to do with this woman.

202
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,949
- Come on, Raj.
- You don't get it.

203
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,356
I want nothing to do with any woman.

204
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,393
My heart is stone.

205
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,793
From now on, I am a monk.

206
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,663
I renounce all worldly pleasures.

207
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,163
Except for lobster.

208
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,838
And garlic butter.

209
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,672
Boy, I wanna tell you it's her loss,
but you are not making it easy.

210
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:14,616
You're a good friend for trying to help,
but I've made my choice.

211
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,980
All right, well...

212
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,351
...I'll see you around.

213
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,258
See you.

214
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,894
No, wait.

215
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,428
Take her number.
I don't want the temptation.

216
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,688
Okay.

217
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:33,203
I must be strong so I don't stray from
my true purpose: The study of the universe.

218
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,906
All right.

219
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,077
Thanks for ruining lobster for me.

220
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,149
Wait! Give me the number!

221
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,259
Give me the number! Give me the number!

222
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,926
So, Amy, what's going on
with your addiction study?

223
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,296
Sadly I'm no longer associated
with that project.

224
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,407
- Why? What happened?
- Typical bureaucratic nonsense.

225
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,602
You can get animals addicted to a harmful
substance, you can dissect their brains...

226
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,715
...but you throw their own feces back at them
and suddenly you're unprofessional.

227
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,447
I'm sorry.

228
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,751
That I asked.

229
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,522
All right, let's get this stupid play over with.

230
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,888
Uh, hang on. Empty your pockets.

231
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,963
- Why?
- You know why. The Nintendo DS.

232
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:38,760
And the PSP.

233
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:44,933
Now the Game Boy.

234
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,334
Oh, for Pete's sake.

235
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,211
- Can we go now?
- Is that all of it?

236
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,989
Just set it down.

237
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,957
Just so you know,
this is not a stupid play.

238
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,430
A Streetcar Named Desire
is an American classic.

239
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,996
It's about streetcars?

240
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,332
Great. Then I won't need this.

241
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,152
Just a sec.

242
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,985
Oh, who says "just a sec"?
I hate myself.

243
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:39,788
Hello.

244
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,433
- Hi.
- Uh, would you like to come in?

245
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,229
Uh, no, I can't stay.

246
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,894
Oh.

247
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,000
I just wanted to say...

248
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,541
...I'm sorry for running out
of the coffee shop. That wasn't cool.

249
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,170
So yeah.

250
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,713
I'm sorry.

251
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,916
Wait.

252
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,489
Can you at least tell me what went wrong?

253
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,351
It's okay, I can take anything.

254
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:10,552
Unless it's something I did, or said, or am,
because those are like my buttons.

255
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,197
No, it's not any of that.

256
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,764
It's just, I kind of have a hard time
around people I don't know.

257
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,431
Really? Then what were you doing
at the comic book store that night?

258
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:29,105
I've been trying to force myself
into situations I'm not comfortable with.

259
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:34,045
I saw the flyer in the store window
and I made myself go in.

260
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,948
I don't even like comic books.

261
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,385
- Yeah, me neither.
- What were you doing there?

262
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,218
I lied. I love them.

263
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,119
I only said that so you'd go out with me.

264
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,797
You don't want to do that.

265
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,398
I'm kind of broken.

266
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,762
That's great. I'm broken too.

267
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,904
- No, you're not.
- I totally am.

268
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,906
If it wasn't for this beer, I couldn't even
talk to you right now. I'm a wreck.

269
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,909
There are many things
seriously wrong with me.

270
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,574
And not quirks either...

271
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,446
...like, diagnosable psychological problems.

272
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,419
Maybe brain damage.

273
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,986
Well, how do I know
you're not just saying that?

274
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,464
Go out with me on one date
and I promise you you'll see.

275
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,268
Okay.

276
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,906
Text me.
Bye.

277
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:33,172
You won't regret it.
I'm the most pathetic guy you've ever met.

278
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,474
And that, boys and girls, is how it's done.

279
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,893
You love her very much, don't you?

280
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,693
Yes.

281
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,387
I think you have great capacity for devotion.

282
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,135
You will be Ionely
when she passes on, won't you?

283
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,429
I understand what that is.

284
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,203
- To be Ionely?
- She's pretty good, huh?

285
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,670
She is.

286
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,935
But when do they get to the part
about streetcars?

287
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,508
When I was a very young girl.

288
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,985
When I was 16 years old,
I made the discovery:

289
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,681
Love.

290
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,985
All at once and much, much too completely.

291
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,525
It was like you turned
a blinding light on something...

292
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,565
...that had always been half a shadow.

293
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,165
That's how it struck the world for me.

294
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,208
But I was unlucky.

295
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,409
Deluded.

296
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,013
- She's remarkable.
- She really is.

297
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,376
Our Penny's a star.

298
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,248
How can she remember all those lines...

299
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:52,355
...but as a waitress, she can't remember
no tomato on my hamburger?
