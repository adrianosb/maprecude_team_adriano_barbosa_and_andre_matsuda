Good evening. I'm your guest lecturer,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

2
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:15,915
I was expecting applause.

3
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:20,052
But I suppose stunned silence
is equally appropriate.

4
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:23,200
I agreed to speak to you
this evening...

5
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:26,268
...because I was told
you're the best and the brightest...

6
00:00:26,437 --> 00:00:28,997
...of this university's
doctoral candidates.

7
00:00:29,173 --> 00:00:32,438
Hmm. That's like saying
you're the most important electron...

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,908
...in a hydrogen atom. Ha, ha.

9
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:40,740
Because, you see,
there's only one electron...

10
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:42,943
...in a hydrogen atom.

11
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,921
Best and brightest,
my sweet patootie.

12
00:00:48,092 --> 00:00:50,322
All right. Let's begin. Show of hands.

13
00:00:50,495 --> 00:00:54,488
Who here is familiar with the concept
of topological insulators?

14
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:56,995
Heh. Don't kid yourselves.

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,161
I found another tweet from a student.

16
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,865
"Dr. Cooper has taken
a relatively boring subject...

17
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:08,409
...and managed to make it
completely insufferable.

18

22

Ooh, somebody took pictures and
uploaded them to their Flickr account.

Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall
to flip you off at the same time?

26
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:36,133
Apparently, if you're Sheldon,
all you need to do is turn your back.

Oh, Sheldon changed the password.
It's now "Penny is a freeloader."

Thanks. What are you guys doing?

32
00:01:49,186 --> 00:01:51,984
Sheldon gave a lecture tonight.
We're reading the reviews.

33
00:01:52,156 --> 00:01:53,350
Oh, how did he do?

34
00:01:53,524 --> 00:01:58,018
Picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl
meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2.

wanna start cutting myself again."

Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:18,576
So how did the lecture go?

42
00:02:18,749 --> 00:02:21,217
In a word, triumphant.

43
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,184
- Really? Triumphant?
- Oh, yes.

44
00:02:25,356 --> 00:02:28,291
Should've seen those people.
They're thirsty for knowledge...

I don't know.
I kind of promised Howard.

- Tell me what?
- Actually, we should share the moment.

50

Raj, if you would.

00:02:46,577 --> 00:02:49,876
Oh, tweets about my lecture.

Hmm.

53
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:57,285
That's rather unfair.

That's downright cruel.

we think it means "kill me now."

Well, I suppose everyone's entitled
to their own opinion.

I think I'll turn in.

60

I didn't wanna teach
those poopy heads anyway.

61

FYI,
I think that's what Darth Vader said...

62
00:03:28,953 --> 00:03:32,116
...just before
he started building the Death Star.

- Sheldon still moping?
- Yeah, it's weird.

64
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:04,883
Though he didn't wanna give the lecture,
being rejected by students hit him hard.

65
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:08,116
Hmm, I know the feeling. Like
accidentally walking into a gay bar...

- Yeah, Leonard and I are fine...

...but I think Raj
needs to meet a girl really soon.

That shouldn't be too hard.
He's a cutie.

But cute is for bunnies.

Labradoodles are hypoallergenic...

to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?

If this experience is troubling you
there are things we could do about it.

- For instance?
- The first thing that comes to mind...

...is isolating the part of your brain
where memory is stored...

Fair enough. But in its essence,
teaching is a performance art.
