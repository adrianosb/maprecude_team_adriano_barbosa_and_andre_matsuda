No, no, no. That was not my point.

No, but you're right.

-Good afternoon, Penny.

203
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:11,611
So, hi, hey. Uh....

204
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:14,739
I was wondering
if you had plans for dinner.

205
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:16,282
Uh, you mean, dinner tonight?

206
00:12:17,787 --> 00:12:20,347
There is an inherent ambiguity
in the word "dinner."

207
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:23,390
Technically,
it refers to the largest meal of the day.

208
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:26,084
So to clarify here,
by dinner, I mean supper.

209
00:12:26,462 --> 00:12:28,259
-Supper?
-Or dinner, you know.

210
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:32,159
I was thinking 6:30 if you can go,
or a different time.

211
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,494
Uh, 6:30 is great.

00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,136

-Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.

Oh, you know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj.
Who all is coming?

216
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,979
They...

217
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:49,114
...might all be there.

218
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:52,948
Or a subset of them might be there.

219
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:55,386
Algebraically speaking,
there are too many unknowns.

220
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:57,549
For example,
Sheldon had Quizno's for lunch.

221
00:12:57,726 --> 00:13:00,286
Sometimes he finds that filling,
other times he doesn't.

222
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:03,762
It's no fault of Quizno's.
They have a varied menu.

223
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:06,963
Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun.

224
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,068
Great.

225
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:10,762
-Did we say a time?
-Six-thirty.

226
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,964
Still good?

227
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:13,768
-It's fine.
-It's not carved in stone.

228
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:15,205
No. Six-thirty is great.

229

230
00:13:18,514 --> 00:13:20,175

233
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:45,003
Could you be more specific?

234
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:49,109
Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?

235
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:54,382
No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns
under your arms conceal it nicely.

236
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:58,416
-What time is your date?
-Six-thirty.

237
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:00,987
Perfect, that gives you
two hours and 1 5 minutes...

00:14:01,156 --> 00:14:04,353
...for that dense molecular cloud
of Aramis to dissipate.

239
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:08,694
-ls it too much?
-Not if you're a rugby team.

00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:13,301
By the way, you didn't join us
because you stuffed yourself...

00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:15,699
...with a chicken carbonara sub
at Quizno's.

242
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:17,264
Why would I join you?

243
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,764
No reason.

244
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:24,611
Oh, you know what?
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

245
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,180
Oh, no, well, now,
there's always the possibility...

246
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:29,544
...that alcohol and poor judgment
on her part...

247
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:32,084
...might lead to a nice romantic evening.

248
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,887
you're right. Alcohol, poor judgment.
It could go well.

249
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:40,553
Of course, there's the other possibility
that this day kicks off...

250
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:43,789
...an unpleasant six months of you
passing awkwardly in the hall...

251
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,833
...until one of you breaks down
and moves to another zip code.

252
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:50,295
you could have stopped at,
"lt could go well."

253
00:14:50,906 --> 00:14:52,931
If I could have, I would have.

254
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:55,936
I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy.
There's no reason...

255
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:58,909
...we couldn't go to the restaurant
and have a lovely dinner.

256
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:03,711
Maybe take a walk afterwards,
talk about things we have in common.

257
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:06,684
"you love pottery? I love pottery."

258
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:09,750
you know, there's a pause.
We both know what's happening.

259
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:11,893
We kiss. It's a little tentative at first.

260
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:15,053
But I realize, she's kissing me back,
she's biting my lower lip.

261
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,357
She wants me.
This thing is going the distance.

262
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:19,524
We're gonna have sex.
Oh, God, oh, my God.

263
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:24,865
Is the sex starting now?

264
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:26,939
I'm having a panic attack.

265
00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:30,442
Oh, okay. Well, then, calm down.

266
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:32,478
If I could,
I wouldn't be having an attack.

267
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:35,048
-That's why they call it a panic attack.
-All right.

268
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:36,775
Would you just sit down?

269
00:15:36,952 --> 00:15:39,512
-yeah, sit down. Now close your eyes.
-Why?

270
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,882
-Well, just do it.
-Okay.

271
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:44,048
Now, try to increase
your alpha-wave activity.

272
00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:46,990
-What?
-It's a biofeedback technique.

273
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:49,289
It's relaxation
through brainwave manipulation.

274
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:51,626
I read it
in Journal of American Neuroscience.

275
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,496
It was sparsely sourced,
but I think the science is valid.

276
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,230
I probably have it here somewhere.

277
00:15:57,406 --> 00:15:59,533
Who am I kidding?
I can't go through with this.

278
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,437
-you need to call her and cancel.
-Me?

279
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,134
-yes.
-What should I tell her?

280
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:05,712
-I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.
-Okay.

281
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,406
Not the kind that would make her
wanna take care of me.

282
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:12,816
But nothing so critical that she'll feel
uncomfortable if I wanna try this again.

283
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:15,479
Got it. So I'm assuming nothing venereal.

284
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:22,722
I'll just tell her that you had
a routine colonoscopy...

285
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,729
...and haven't quite bounced back.

286
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,300
-Give me the phone.
-I thought you wanted to cancel.

287
00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:30,267
I can't. If I don't show up,
she'll still be expecting you.

288
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:32,838
Why would she be expecting me?

289
00:16:33,842 --> 00:16:37,869
Stop asking me all these questions.
I need to take another shower.

290
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:43,778
-Are the rest of the guys meeting us here?
-Oh, yeah.

291
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:45,283
No.

292
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:47,879
Turns out that Raj and Howard
had to work...

293
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:53,518
...and Sheldon had a colonoscopy,
and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.

294
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:56,760
Ooh, my uncle just had
a colonoscopy.

295
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:01,028
You're kidding. Well, then,
that's something we have in common.

296
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,265
How?

297
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:09,935
We both have people in our lives
who wanna nip intestinal polyps in the bud.

298
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:17,911
So, what's new in the world of physics?

299
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:20,579
Nothing.

300
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,980
Really? Nothing?

301
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:28,653
Well, with the exception of string theory,
not much has happened since the 1 930s...

302
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,560
...and you can't prove string theory.

303
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:36,171
At best you can say, "Hey, look, my idea
has an internal logical consistency."

304
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,969
Ah. Well, I'm sure things will pick up.

305
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,071
What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?

306
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:49,683
Oh, uh, not much.

307
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:54,255
Oh, we do have a chocolate key lime
that's moving pretty well.

308
00:17:54,423 --> 00:17:55,947
Good.

00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,857
Good.

310
00:18:00,796 --> 00:18:04,960
Uh, what about
your, uh, hallway friend?

311
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:09,537
Doug? Oh, yeah. I don't know. I mean,
you know, he's nice and funny, but--

312
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:11,969
-Can I get you started with some drinks?
-No. Bzzz.

313
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:15,369
-You were saying, "But...."?
-I'd like a drink.

314
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:18,809
Just say the "but" thing about Doug,
and then I'll get her back.

315
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:22,247
Okay, well, it--
I don't know. It's just me.

316
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:24,578
I'm still getting over this break-up
with Kurt.

317
00:18:24,753 --> 00:18:27,551
And this thing with Doug
would just be rebound sex.

318
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:32,321
Ugh. Don't get me started
on rebound sex.

319
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,161
It's just-- It's my pattern.

320
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:36,524
I break up, then I find some cute guy...

321
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:40,429
...and then it's just
36 meaningless hours of....

322
00:18:40,602 --> 00:18:41,830
you know.

323
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,305
I'm not sure that I do. Um....

324
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:51,477
Is that one 36-hour experience
or is that 36 hours spread out over...

325
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:55,105
...say, one glorious summer?

326
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:56,751
No. It's usually over a weekend.

327
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:59,683
And trust me,
you do not feel good after it.

328
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,285
Well, chafing, right?

329
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,516
Emotionally.

330
00:19:04,693 --> 00:19:07,594
Of course, yeah. Emotional chafing.

331
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,831
Hey, do you wanna see something cool?

332
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,438
I can make this olive go into this glass
without touching it.

333
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:25,339
-How?
-Physics.

334
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:32,849
Wow, centrifugal force.

335
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:36,320
Actually, it's centripetal force,
which is an inward force...

336
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:39,790
...generated by the glass
acting on the olive. Ooh.

337
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:41,891
Excuse me.

338
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:45,192
Now, if you were biting on the olive...

339
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:48,894
...you'd be on a non-inertial
reference frame and would--

340
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:53,502
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

341
00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:55,700
Did you spill ketchup?

342
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:58,210
-No.
-I'm not okay.

343
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:03,381
You don't wanna go
to the emergency room?

344
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:04,576
No, no. I'm okay.

345
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:06,152
It's stopped bleeding.

346
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:09,290
Anyway, you did throw up.
Isn't that a sign of a concussion?

347
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,723
yes, but I get carsick too, so....

348
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:13,919
Okay.

349
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:15,791
Sorry about your car, by the way.

350
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:19,593
Oh, no, it's fine.
You got most of it out the window.

351
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:22,102
The poor guy on the bike.

352
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,864
I had a nice time.

353
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:27,968
yeah, me too.

354
00:20:29,044 --> 00:20:30,341
Well, um, good night.

355
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,410
Good night.

356
00:20:33,382 --> 00:20:35,009
-Leonard.
-yeah?

357
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:38,048
Was this supposed to be a date?

358
00:20:38,854 --> 00:20:40,515
This?

359
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:43,114
No.

360
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,383
No, of course not.

361
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,791
This was just you and me hanging out
with guys who didn't show up...

362
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:52,092
...because of work and a colonoscopy.

363
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:54,892
Okay. I was just checking.

364
00:20:56,104 --> 00:21:00,507
When I take a girl on a date,
and I do, heh...

365
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,844
...she knows she's been dated.

366
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,539
Capital D. Heh.

367
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:12,511
Bold face, underlined, like, dated.

368
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:16,321
I think I might have a concussion.
I'm gonna go lay down.

369
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:17,924
Good night.

370
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,863
-So how was your date?
-Awesome. Heh.

371
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:32,097
Score one for liquor and poor judgment.

372
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:01,759
