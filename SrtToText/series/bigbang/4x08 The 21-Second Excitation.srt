["RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK"
THEME PLAYING ON TV]

2
00:00:17,814 --> 00:00:18,974
Okay, help me out here.

3
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:22,846
How does an archeology professor
get that good with a whip?

4
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,015
Maybe he took a class at the
adult bookstore. That's how I learned.

5
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:29,855
I can't believe you've never seen
Raiders of the Lost Ark.

6
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:33,585
And I can't believe you've never read
Eat, Pray, Love.

7
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:38,999
When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run
Away From a Giant Boulder, I'll read it.

8
00:00:40,236 --> 00:00:44,798
I don't care if Eat, Pray, Love,
changed your life, I'm not reading it.

9
00:00:45,976 --> 00:00:48,001
You know,
I could totally rock a hat like that.

10
00:00:48,244 --> 00:00:51,839
That's the work of noted Hollywood
costume designer Deborah Nadoolman.

11
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:56,178
She designed the red and black jacket
in Michael Jackson's "Thriller" video...

12
00:00:56,353 --> 00:00:58,548
...which I've never viewed
in its entirety...

13
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:01,781
...as I find zombies dancing
in synchronicity implausible.

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,628
And also, it's really scary.

15
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,765
Could someone please turn off
the Sheldon commentary track?

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,469
There's no switch.
Just listen and learn.

17
00:01:14,704 --> 00:01:16,865
Penny,
you should come with us Friday...

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,338
...to see it on the big screen
at the Colonial.

19
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm watching it now.
Why would I wanna see it again?

20
00:01:22,178 --> 00:01:23,907
Because the print they're showing...

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,141
...has an additional 21 seconds
of previously unseen footage.

22
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:32,219
Wha... Twenty-one seconds?
That'll be like seeing a whole new movie.

23
00:01:32,856 --> 00:01:35,916
Exactly. They say it finally solves
the submarine controversy.

24
00:01:36,493 --> 00:01:40,429
Leonard, I'm no expert, but I believe
what we just heard from Penny...

25
00:01:40,597 --> 00:01:42,827
...was sarcasm.

26
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:46,230
Oh, good. I'm 8-for-26 this month.

27
00:01:48,104 --> 00:01:51,665
Yeah, I think I'll pass. But you guys
enjoy your extra 21 seconds.

28
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:55,675
If I could make you understand why this
is a cool thing, we'd still be together.

29
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:58,871
Hmm... Yeah. No, we wouldn't.

30
00:01:59,949 --> 00:02:03,077
Uh-huh. I'm guessing 21 seconds
had something to do with that too.

31
00:02:03,253 --> 00:02:04,584
[CHUCKLES]

32
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:39,748
May I point out to you all that
the screening is first come, first served?

33
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:43,289
Relax, it's 5:00.
The movie doesn't start till midnight.

34
00:02:44,327 --> 00:02:49,094
Another way of saying that is: The movie
starts at midnight and it's already 5:00.

35
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:52,291
If we miss it, we'll have the fun of
listening to Sheldon...

36
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:54,630
...whine about it
for the rest of our lives.

37
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:57,466
See? Howard's on my side.

38
00:02:57,974 --> 00:03:01,102
Actually, I'm not.
I'm using sarcasm to mock you.

39
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:04,508
Drat. Now I'm 8-for-27.

40
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:07,012
Don't worry, Sheldon. We'll be fine.

41
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:11,119
What happened to the Leonard who
waited in line with me for 14 hours...

42
00:03:11,287 --> 00:03:13,619
...to see the premiere
of Star Trek: Nemesis?

43
00:03:13,823 --> 00:03:18,021
Oh, well, he waited in line for 14 hours
while you napped in a lawn chair...

44
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:20,992
...he got in a fight
when he stepped out of line to pee...

45
00:03:21,164 --> 00:03:23,462
...and you wouldn't wake up
to vouch for him.

46
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:26,534
And worst of all,
he saw Star Trek: Nemesis.

47
00:03:27,137 --> 00:03:28,661
But how were our seats?

48
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:31,332
- Excellent.
- I rest my case.

49
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,510
Amy, don't you agree we should
leave now and get in line?

50
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:38,540
As the newest member
of your social group...

51
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:43,049
...I'll gain more acceptance by siding
with your friends from time to time.

52
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,015
Shrewd.

53
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,416
Leonard, you're right.
We should enjoy our meal, arrive late...

54
00:03:50,627 --> 00:03:54,358
...and risk winding up with terrible seats,
assuming we get in at all.

55
00:03:55,064 --> 00:03:56,656
Thank you, Amy.

56
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,926
See? It's working.

57
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,538
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

58
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:04,570
- Olive.
- "I love" you too.

Guys, that's really starting to get old.

61

- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

62
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:12,845
I have a girlfriend and you don't.

Hysterical.

We don't know that yet, he isn't finished.
I have a girlfriend and you don't who?

66
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:25,184
So are you sure you don't wanna
come with us to Raiders?

67
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:28,228
Oh, no. That movie has melting faces.

68
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:29,729
It reminds me of the time...

69
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:33,391
...I dropped that vial of flesh-eating
bacteria into the monkey lab.

70
00:04:35,672 --> 00:04:38,436
Besides, Penny and I
are having a girls' night tonight.

71
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:40,602
Girls' night? What does that entail?

72
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,541
Oh, you know, girls get together,
hang out, share girl talk.

73
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:46,744
I'm a girl.

74
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:51,385
Well, maybe you can join us.
I'll ask Penny.

75
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:54,250
No need. Penny and I are very close.

76
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:56,481
- You are?
- Yes.

77
00:04:56,693 --> 00:04:59,218
In fact, our menses are synchronized.

78

Penny, Bernadette tells me
you're planning a girls' night.

79
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:09,101
Yeah?

80
00:05:09,272 --> 00:05:11,001
I'm a girl.

81
00:05:12,141 --> 00:05:14,473
Oh, it was just gonna be
me and Bernadette.

82
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:16,976
I thought you were going to movies
with the guys?

83
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:19,841
Yes, but they're not girls. I'm a girl.

84
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:24,075
Yeah. No, no. I got that.

85
00:05:24,988 --> 00:05:28,082
- What's the dress code?
- Just wear something comfortable.

86
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,920
All right. I'll have to go shopping.

87

- Who's there?
- Hugh.

- Hugh who?
- "You" people need to listen to me.

90
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:47,266
It's time to get in line for the movie.

91
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:50,639
And that's how you tell
a knock-knock joke.

92
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,644
Under normal circumstances
I'd say I told you so...

93
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:03,348
...but as I have told you so with such
vehemence and frequency already...

94
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:05,551
...the phrase has lost all meaning.

95
00:06:05,762 --> 00:06:11,359
Therefore, I will be replacing it
with the phrase "I informed you thusly."

96
00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:13,661
Can't wait for that to start.

97
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:15,997
I informed you thusly.

Eight-for-28.

This is where we could've been
if we hadn't stopped for dinner.

100
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:27,881
This is where we could've been
if Koothrappali hadn't ordered dessert.

101
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:29,984
I earned it, dude. I ate all my broccoli.

102
00:06:30,186 --> 00:06:35,180
And here's where we are,
the runts in a large litter...

103
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:40,886
...unlikely to ever reach
the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones.

104
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:43,827
So I guess it's a good thing
we stopped for dinner.

to make a long story short...

...turns out I have
an unusually firm cervix.

You know, heh, Amy,
when we say girl talk...

111
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:09,047
...it doesn't just have to be
about our lady parts.

Shame. Because I have a real zinger
about my tilted uterus.

I found this place in Alhambra.
It's in a woman's basement.

So where should we go tonight?
A bar? A club? A movie?

121

of you will become my best friend forever.

call this an actual slumber party.

Oh, I've always wanted to be
invited to a slumber party.

- Not even when you were a kid?

I had my tonsils out...

with a little Vietnamese girl.

and it keeps your calf warm.

Hey, guys, bad news,
I just did a quick calculation.

149
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:22,855
Given the size of the theater
and this line, we might not get seats.
