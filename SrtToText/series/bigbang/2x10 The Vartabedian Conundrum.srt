- Ugh.

You're the doctor, but I'm constantly
hearing this annoying sound.

Me too.

4
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,823
Is it a high-frequency whistle?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,494
No, it's more of a relentless,
narcissistic drone.

Yeah, there's no inflammation at all,
Sheldon.

Then it must be a tumor.

I seriously doubt it.

9
00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:34,507
Maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection
from all those childhood toilet swirlies.

10
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:39,386
Is that possible?
I used to get those all the time.

11
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:41,786
Even in church.

12
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:46,856
Well, you know, if it is from a swirly,
there's something I can do, okay. Ahem.

Circle, circle, dot, dot,

- Okay.

15
00:00:54,904 --> 00:00:57,202
- I'll be right in.
- Okay.

16
00:00:57,507 --> 00:00:58,997
It's not enough she mocks me...

17
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:02,372
...but that isn't even the correct procedure
for a cootie shot.

Do you understand that Stephanie's
not here to treat your imaginary ailments?

Second? None heard, the motion fails.

I'd like to begin the meeting
by congratulating you on the progress...

...in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.

- Thank you.
- And that being said...

32
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:45,152
...we have to discuss the implementation
of the cohabitation rider...

now that you're living together.

Okay, wait. I only initialed it
because I never thought it would happen.

- Good morning, Dr. Stephanie.

I trust Leonard satisfied you
sexually last night?

Oh, good God.

Sheldon, we don't ask questions like that.

I heard you ask it over and over.

this woman who lives across the hall...

00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,266
- Sheldon? What are you doing here?
- Hang on.

156
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:57,672
130/80. That's a little high.

157
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,914
We can attribute that to the stress
of sneaking past the security desk.

158
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,876
Where did you get the stethoscope
and pressure cuff?

159
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:07,784
My Aunt Marion gave them to me
for my 12th birthday.

160
00:10:09,392 --> 00:10:13,692
She thought if I failed at theoretical physics
that I should have a trade to fall back on.

161
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:18,464
And by the way, the blood pressure cuff
is called a sphygmomanometer.

162
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:22,070
- Thank you.
- Didn't teach you that in medical school?

163
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,436
- I'm kind of busy here.
- I understand.

164
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:28,406
All I need is for you to authorize
these tests.

165
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:32,877
Ha. A cardiac stress test,
a full-body MRI, an electromyogram...

166
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,142
...a CBC, baseline glucose, upper GI?

167
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:38,481
Oh, and exploratory laparoscopy.
The last time I had hiccups...

168
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:41,589
...it felt like my diaphragm
was just going through the motions.

169
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:44,258
Go home, Sheldon.

170
00:10:44,427 --> 00:10:46,224
Can I at least have the upper GI?

171
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:49,396
I already drank the barium.

172
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:52,859
Oh, hey.

173
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:54,969
Oh, good.
Do you have any fabric softener?

174
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:56,866
Yeah, sure.

175
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:08,741
What are you washing, a crocodile?

176
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:11,745
No. The pants that Stephanie got me.

177
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,413
Oh, sweetie, you can't machine wash these.
They'll be ruined.

178
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,252
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

179
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:23,898
Oh, no. I wish you'd told me that sooner.

180
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:29,266
- Are you guys having problems?
- No. Everything's fine.

181
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:32,503
- Really?
- Yeah, it's wonderful.

182
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,773
Okay, maybe this whole
living together happened...

183
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,074
...kind of suddenly,
but it's fine, it's great.

184
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:43,514
Okay, Leonard, if you're uncomfortable
with the way things are going...

185
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,677
...you're allowed to say something.

186
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:48,255
Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.

187
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:51,626
Believe me, your feelings
are just as important as hers.

188
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:55,726
No, that doesn't sound right either.

189
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,893
Tell her you need the relationship to move
at a pace you both are comfortable with.

190
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:05,140
Yeah, I could say something
like that to her.

191
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,404
I'll go do that.

192
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:09,970
- Thank you.
- Sure.

193
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:17,518
You have a really good grasp on this.

194
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:19,677
Maybe you could talk to her?

195
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:22,413
You're kidding, right?

196
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:25,326
No, but that's okay.

197
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:29,828
I'll go talk to her.

198
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,926
Wanna come with?

199
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:36,694
Go.

200
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,008
Wow.

201
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:49,581
Oh, no.

202
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:51,777
What?

203
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:54,923
You were right.
Your larynx is terribly inflamed.

204
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,958
- I mean, I've never seen anything like it.
- I knew it.

205
00:13:00,496 --> 00:13:02,760
What do I do?

206
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:06,792
You're gonna need to stop talking,
immediately.

207
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:09,729
- For how long should--?
- Eh, eh, eh!

208
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:12,598
lmmediately.

209
00:13:14,944 --> 00:13:16,275
- Hey.
- Oh, hi, honey.

210
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:18,106
Sheldon.

211
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:26,812
What's going on?

212
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:30,583
I just performed a Sheldon-ectomy.

213
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,358
Careful. If you don't get it all,
it'll only come back worse.

214
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,758
[LAUGHS]

215
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:38,297
- Gotcha.
- Listen, we need to talk.

216
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:40,359
Uh-oh.

217
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:43,232
Do we need to talk,
or do we need to talk.

218
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:45,907
I don't know what that means.

219
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,533
Okay, why don't you just tell me
what it is you have to tell me?

220
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:51,202
Okay. Um....

221
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:53,979
Well, look, it's just that...

222
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:58,017
...things between you and me
have been going pretty quick.

223
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:01,646
- And?
- It's just a little scary.

224
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:04,551
Well, yeah, but scary good, right?

225
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:06,723
Sure.

226
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,894
When is scary not good?

227
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:16,433
- But-- Okay. Um, I have feelings, right?
- Uh-huh.

228
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,665
Okay, and it's perfectly okay to express
those feelings, right?

229
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:22,310
Of course. Why don't you tell me
what you're feeling?

230
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:26,278
Okay, well, I ju-- I think it's important
to remember that we move...

231
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:31,408
...at a pace that is our speed and....

232
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,882
Oh, shoot, I had it.

233
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:38,849
Okay, how about this?
How about I tell you what I'm feeling?

234
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:40,928
What's that?

235
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:45,256
Really? Right now?

236
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,929
- Why not?
- I just ate.

237
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:50,128
Aren't you supposed to wait an hour?

238
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:54,869
I think that's for swimming.

239
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:58,139
- Ah. Okay.
- Okay.

240
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,514
- Hope I don't get cramps.
- Yeah.

241
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,281
- Hey.
- Hey.

242
00:15:05,454 --> 00:15:07,718
- Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer.
- Thank you.

243
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,188
- Your pants are ruined.
- Good.

244
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,220
So how did the talk with Stephanie go?

245
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:19,561
Well, um, on one level, really, really well.

246
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,729
So you told her you wanted
to slow things down?

247
00:15:22,905 --> 00:15:27,308
Not specifically.
But, um, I did tell her that I had feelings.

248
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:29,637
Good. Good.

249
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:31,279
And then what?

250
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:36,776
And then the subject
got changed somehow.

251
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,850
You had sex, didn't you?

252
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:41,548
Um....

253
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:43,248
Little bit.

254
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:48,858
- What?
- Nothing.

255
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,598
Okay, well, it sounds like
things are gonna work out.

256
00:15:55,771 --> 00:15:57,568
Yeah. Yeah, it's all good.

257
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,675
Everything's gonna work out,
one way or another.

258
00:16:01,176 --> 00:16:02,837
God, come on, Leonard.

259
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:06,448
You are entitled to try and make things
go the way you want them to.

260
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:08,877
- Really?
- Yes.

261
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,611
You don't always have to go along
with what the woman wants.

262
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:13,520
Huh.

263
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:19,492
- What?
- Nothing. Just rethinking my whole life.

264
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:26,835
Okay, here's the thing.

265
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:30,733
I'm afraid that if I ask her to move out,
she'll just dump me.

266
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,170
Well, that's a chance you have to take.

267
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:35,742
I mean, look, if it's meant to be, it'll be.

268
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,013
Very comforting.

269
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:43,476
Okay, so, what do I say to her?

270
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:46,110
I don't know.
What have women said to you...

271
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:48,916
...when they wanted
to slow a relationship down?

272
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,549
I really like you,
but I wanna see how things go with Mark?

273
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:57,591
Yeah, that'll slow it down.

274
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:02,064
[BOTH PANTING]

275
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,141
I'm sorry, I totally interrupted you.
What were you saying?

276
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:10,477
Oh.

277
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,641
Right, yeah. Um....

278
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:17,047
So, Stephanie, here's the thing.

279
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:22,550
- I really like you--
- Oh, God, here comes the speech.

280
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:27,188
What speech?

281
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:32,595
I really like you but maybe we should spend
a little less time together...

282
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:36,204
...because I need my space,
but I'll call you on Tuesday.

283
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:39,829
And then you never call me, so I call you,
but you don't call me back.

284
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:42,272
And then when I run into you
at the coffee shop...

285
00:17:42,444 --> 00:17:44,844
...you pretend you have problems
with voice mail...

286
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:48,449
...and I know that you're lying
but I pretend like I don't care...

287
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:51,415
...even though I'm dying inside.

288
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:57,483
No.

289
00:17:58,961 --> 00:18:02,453
No, no. Uh,
I wasn't gonna say any of that.

290
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:04,724
I was just gonna say...

291
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:09,168
- ...I really like you.
- Oh!

292
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:14,602
Oh, good, because I really like you too.

293
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:20,614
Terrific.

294
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:27,922
- Hey.
- Hey.

295
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:29,849
Hey.

296
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:32,751
Nice sweater.

297
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:36,593
Yeah. Stephanie got it for me.
It's kind of fun.

298
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:39,457
It's got a big bird on it, dude.

299
00:18:40,736 --> 00:18:43,296
Yeah, yeah. That's the fun part.

300
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:48,004
We're also getting new curtains for my
bedroom and a dust ruffle and a duvet.

301
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:52,170
And I don't even know what a duvet is,
but I'm sure if I did I wouldn't want one.

302
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:56,647
But every time I talk to her about
moving out, she cries and we have sex.

303
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:00,820
You're lucky.
With me, it's usually the other way around.

304
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:05,050
You know, if you can't talk to her,
why don't you just text her?

305
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:09,296
- Isn't that kind of cowardly?
- Oh, yeah. It's beyond contemptible.

306
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:13,531
That's true. But, on the other hand,
you are wearing a bird sweater.

307
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:19,434
Sold.

308
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:24,976
"I think it would be better
for our relationship...

309
