1
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:06,245
Hey, do me a favor and take Table 7?

2
00:00:07,218 --> 00:00:10,676
You mean, the one with my 118-pound
rock-hard stud of a fiancé...

3
00:00:10,855 --> 00:00:14,154
...who's prone to canker sores
and pinkeye?

4
00:00:14,325 --> 00:00:17,089
I prefer to look at it
as the one with my ex-boyfriend...

5
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:22,289
...and his gorgeous, successful girlfriend
who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.

6
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:26,126
Do you want me
to spill hot soup on her?

7
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:29,370
Please, you're not that kind of person.

8
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,598
I know.

9
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:35,474
But if she orders something low-fat,
I'll totally give her the full-fat version.

10
00:00:37,748 --> 00:00:38,976
That's my water.

11
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:41,351
- What?
- My water, you're drinking it.

12
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:43,987
Dear Lord.

13
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,656
- Have you been drinking it?
- Yes, it's my water.

14
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,526
Well, that's it then. I'm dead.

15
00:00:52,163 --> 00:00:53,790
Here we go.

16
00:00:53,964 --> 00:00:56,296
I'm sorry,
do I need to connect the dots for you?

17
00:00:56,467 --> 00:00:57,957
The backwash into this glass...

18
00:00:58,135 --> 00:01:01,036
...is every pathogen that
calls your mouth "home sweet home."

19
00:01:01,205 --> 00:01:03,833
Not to mention
the visitors who arrive on the tongue...

20
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:05,839
...of your subtropical girlfriend.

21
00:01:07,178 --> 00:01:10,341
Hey, that's my sister and my country
you're talking about.

22
00:01:10,514 --> 00:01:12,004
Leonard may have defiled one...

23
00:01:12,183 --> 00:01:15,277
...but I won't have you talking smack
about the other.

24
00:01:15,486 --> 00:01:17,078
- You guys ready to order?
- Yes.

25
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:19,347
I'd like a seven-day course
of penicillin...

26
00:01:19,523 --> 00:01:23,687
...some syrup of ipecac
to induce vomiting and a mint.

27
00:01:24,595 --> 00:01:27,359
- I don't understand.
- He drank from Leonard's glass.

28
00:01:27,531 --> 00:01:29,055
"He drank from Leonard's glass."

29
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:31,827
The words they'll be carving
into my tombstone.

30
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:35,201
- That's actually my napkin.
- Oh, this is a nightmare.

31
00:01:36,106 --> 00:01:37,164
Where are you going?

32
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:39,707
To the bar
to sterilize my mouth with alcohol.

33
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:42,877
Gangway, dead man walking.

34
00:02:09,473 --> 00:02:12,499
All right, here we go.
Two lemonades...

35
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:14,337
...one iced tea...

36
00:02:14,512 --> 00:02:16,742
...and a root beer for Priya.

37
00:02:16,914 --> 00:02:20,441
- Is it diet?
- That's what you ordered.

38
00:02:22,686 --> 00:02:26,178
Thank you. Hey, have you and Howard
started planning your wedding yet?

39
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,121
Yeah. We're thinking of having it
on a cliff overlooking the ocean.

40
00:02:30,294 --> 00:02:32,353
Nothing soothes those
pre-wedding jitters...

41
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,192
...like the thought of falling
and drowning.

42
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:38,658
What'd your mother say
when you told her?

43
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:41,498
He hasn't told her yet.
He's waiting for the right time.

44
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:45,130
I was thinking of weaving it
into her eulogy.

45
00:02:45,543 --> 00:02:48,103
Howard,
you've got to tell your mother.

46
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:52,010
Have you told your parents you're dating
this short glass of skimmed milk yet?

47
00:02:54,218 --> 00:02:57,051
That's different.
First of all, we're not engaged...

48
00:02:57,221 --> 00:03:00,952
...and second, Indian parents
are very protective of their children.

49
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:06,290
Right. Whereas Jewish mothers take
a casual la-di-da approach to their sons.

50
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:12,196
I gargled with tequila
and may have swallowed a teeny bit.

51
00:03:12,369 --> 00:03:15,065
- You all right?
- Fine. Thank you for asking.

52
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:16,706
I love you so much.

Check it, Howard pulls one out
from under the bridge. Nice.

Oh, yeah, she's got puddles
in all the right places.

Could you please play the game
without commenting on every card?

Sorry.

- Okay, the eagle has landed.
- What's going on?

65
00:04:05,356 --> 00:04:09,258
Bernadette and my mother are having
a get-to-know-you lunch at the deli.

66
00:04:09,426 --> 00:04:10,586
That sounds lovely.

67
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:13,059
Hope so.
Course, if history is any indication...

68
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,757
...my mother will swallow her whole
and spit out her bones like an owl.

69
00:04:18,435 --> 00:04:21,802
- Have you met Bernadette's parents?
- You mean Adolf and Eva?

00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:27,604
Not yet. One goose step at a time.

Oh, dear Lord.

That's not your water.

So how'd it go?

Too soon to say, I'm not done yet!

I had a pastrami sandwich.
She had eggplant lasagna.

84
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:15,452
Like that's what a person orders
in a Jewish deli.

85
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:19,161
Besides food, did you get along?

00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:21,126
- Did you talk?
- Oh, sure.

Did you know she's going to school
to become a microbiologist?

No, she never mentioned it.

Do you like her?
I mean, she's great, huh?

She's a lovely girl. Cute as a button.

That's good to hear
because I've got some news.

I hope it's good news...

but disappointment in here.

I don't know, maybe.
I have no idea what you said.

about your own well-being than his.

00:09:46,396 --> 00:09:48,728
What can I tell you,
after I found the courage...

156
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,834
...to put her pants back on,
I was unstoppable.

157
00:09:53,704 --> 00:09:56,798
- So how is she?
- They're running tests, I don't know.

158
00:09:56,974 --> 00:10:00,637
It may have been a heart attack
or heart-attack-like event.

159
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:03,336
- What's the difference?
- A heart-attack-like event...

160
00:10:03,513 --> 00:10:06,414
...is an event that's like a heart attack.

161

Thanks for clearing that up.

162
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:12,179
Regardless, coronary problems
are eminently treatable.

163

What's more likely
to kill Howard's mother...

164
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:16,784
...are the antibiotic-resistant
superbugs...

of this hospital.

I'll sit over there. It looks cleaner.

Is there heart disease in your family?

171
00:10:35,846 --> 00:10:39,543
My family is the history
of heart disease.

172
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,244
There's a cave painting in France
of one of my ancestors doing this:

173
00:10:47,324 --> 00:10:50,350
- So it's probably genetic.
- Well, maybe.

174

Mom also had just gotten some news
that might have upset her.

175
00:10:54,464 --> 00:10:56,864
- What?
- It's not important.

Howard, I'm gonna be your wife,
you can share anything with me.

You'd think that, but no.

178
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:11,203
You told her we were gonna get married
and she had a heart attack?

179
00:11:11,381 --> 00:11:14,509
You can't take that personally.

180
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:18,154
How else is she supposed to take it?

181
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:22,086
What you've gotta keep in mind
is that ever since my dad left...

182
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:24,590
...l've been the whole world
to my mother.

183
00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:29,755
I mean, she'd be threatened by any
woman who can give me what she can't.

184
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:32,401
You mean, sexual intercourse?

185
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:38,696
Well, when you say it like that,
you make it sound creepy.

186
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:41,571
- What happened?
- Howard's mother had a heart attack...

187
00:11:41,745 --> 00:11:45,545
...because I have sex with him
and she can't.

It's just so weird.
Howard Wolowitz is my friend.

195
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:14,605
You know he tried to stick his tongue
down my throat and I broke his nose?

196
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:18,380
That's a little easier to believe
than he's your friend.

Yeah, tell me about it.

198

My brother had a group of friends
like this in India.

199
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,085
They dressed up in leotards
and goggles.

200

And called themselves
the New Delhi Power Rangers.

You mean, when he was little.

Do you really want her
telling the other one why?

I don't have anything to hide.

You are a mean little man.

because my parents didn't love me...

and no one will take me home.

- It wasn't a heart attack.

She's awake, she's resting comfortably
and we're still running tests.
