313
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:07,061
This is a street fight.

314
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:09,329
The street has no rules.

315
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,735
He's right, Leonard.
The paradigm is to the death.

316
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:15,934
I will, however, give you the opportunity
to concede my superiority now...

317
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:19,547
...and offer me your robot
as the spoils of war.

318
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:23,084
Never. I'd rather see Monte dead
than in your hands.

319
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:24,810
That could be easily arranged.

320
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:27,515
Ready, set, go?

321
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:29,982
- Do it.
- All right, then.

322
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:33,151
Ready, set, go.

323
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,527
- Come on, Sheldon, you got this.
- Indeed.

324
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,169
We are prepared for anything
he can throw at us.

325
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:51,112
That's new.

326
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,611
Run, Monte, run.

327
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:55,409
RAJESH: Run, Monte.
LEONARD: Go. Go, Monte, go.

328
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:58,078
- Run, Monte.
- Go, go, go.

329
00:19:00,989 --> 00:19:04,447
Don't hurt us, don't hurt us,
don't hurt us.

330
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:15,700
Well, so much for making up
for the emotional wounds of childhood.

331
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:18,662
I did this.

332
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:22,038
Monte was killed
by my hubris and my pride.

333
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:24,304
No matter what anybody says,
this is my fault.

334
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:26,777
No one's arguing with you, dude.

335
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:29,879
I got your text. How bad is--? Oi.

336
00:19:32,054 --> 00:19:34,454
Forget the robot. What happened to you?

337
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,685
- He slipped and fell.
- Yes.

338
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,418
I slipped and fell.

339
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,926
In the bathroom.

340
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,030
Bounced right off the tub.

341
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:46,497
Yes. Now he knows
what bathtubs are capable of doing...

342
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:48,602
...when you don't treat them
with respect.

343
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,571
Yeah.

344
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:53,774
They sucker-punch you
when your eyes are closed.

345
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:57,274
So, what do you think, Howard?

346
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,505
lt-- It's not that bad, right?

347
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:03,074
Yeah, no.
A little electrical tape, some solder--

348
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:04,810
Are you insane?

349
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:09,515
I've seen space probes that crashed into the
desert that were in better shape than this.

350
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:12,224
You're right.

351
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:13,827
Monte's gone.

352
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:17,329
We'll bury him in the morning.
A simple ceremony. I'll speak.

353
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,130
Leonard, you'll play your cello.

354
00:20:21,036 --> 00:20:25,268
Sheldon, honey, aren't you getting a little
carried away? I mean, it's just a toy robot.

355
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,543
Just a toy robot?

356
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:36,778
Penny.

357
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:38,180
I know, I got it.

358
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:42,623
Sheldon? I'm sorry.

359
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:46,151
Well, don't get the wrong idea.

360
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,729
The way I see it,
I'm halfway to pity sex.

361
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:21,285
