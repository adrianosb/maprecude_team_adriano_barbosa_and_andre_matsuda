1
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,598
Okay. "Now holding sides of hearth
in position...

2
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:09,104
...Iower mantelpiece assembly
onto top tabs."

3
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:14,311
Look at that, I built a fireplace
with my own two hands.

4
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,546
You're so butch.

5
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,542
Aw, I got a little paper cut.

6
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:22,813
Of course you did.
You're hands are softer than veal.

7
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:28,460
Oh, uh, before I forget, Saturday I'm planning
a Dungeons & Dragons night with the guys.

8
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,096
That's how you're gonna spend
your Saturday night?

9
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:34,256
- Come on, I hardly get a chance to play.
- You poor thing.

10
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,732
Is having a real girlfriend
who has sex with you...

11
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:39,269
...getting in the way
of your board games?

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,135
A little bit, yeah.

13
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,040
Oh, great, I've always wanted to play
Dungeons & Dragons.

14
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,148
Oh, I'm sorry,
I should've mentioned this earlier.

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,476
You're not invited.

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,978
Why not?

17
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:59,489
Amy, from time to time,
we men need to break free...

18
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:05,791
...from the shackles of civility and get
in touch with our primal, animalistic selves.

19
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,564
By rolling dice and playing make-believe
with little figurines?

20
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,795
Like a bunch of savages.

21
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,407
Saturday night?
But I've been working late all week.

22
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:20,239
- That was gonna be our night.
- I have to go, we play as a group.

23
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,507
And if I'm not there,
then everyone will blame you.

24
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:27,414
They'll be all, "Bernadette ruined
everything. She's the worst."

25
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:33,789
So you see, heh,
I have to play Dungeons & Dragons.

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,791
For the marriage.

27
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,661
You're an idiot.

28
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:43,995
I'm your idiot. Forever.

29
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:48,497
So listen, I know we talked about
getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake...

30
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,200
...then seeing the Christmas lights
in Griffith Park...

31
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:55,347
...but Leonard's talking about
a big D and D game at his place.

32
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,949
Saturday night just went
from crazy to epic.

33
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,142
Woo-hoo!

34
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,278
All right, Sheldon, to start our quest...

35
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,814
...you need to open this Christmas gift
I got you.

36
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,576
A Christmas gift?

37
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,811
You know I don't enjoy Christmas.

38
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,288
- What's wrong with Christmas?
- Oh, where to begin?

39
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:44,294
Trees indoors.
Overuse of the words "'tis" and "'twas."

40
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,092
And the absurd custom of one stocking.

41
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,792
Everyone knows socks belong in pairs.

42
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:54,030
- Who uses one sock?
- A pirate with a peg leg. Heh.

43
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,438
Actually, that helps. Thank you.

44
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,475
Would you just look inside?

45
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,778
Oh, a scroll! I like scrolls.

46
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,647
They're my third-favorite system
of transmitting the written word.

47
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,345
After stone tablets and skywriting.

48
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,887
"You have all been summoned to join
a thrilling Dungeons & Dragons adventure.

49
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:19,520
Your quest begins in a secret
northern village of elves...

50
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,098
...who have all been massacred."

51
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,326
Ah! I like where this is headed.

52
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:27,800
"Your task is to rescue their leader
from a dungeon of ogres."

53
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,737
That's a saucy twist.

54
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,576
"That leader's name: Santa Claus."

55
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,838
No, no, no.

56
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,177
It's actually "ho, ho, ho,"
but you'll get the hang of it.

57
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,649
Thought it'd be fun to make
a holiday-themed quest.

58
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,722
Fun? Mixing Dungeons & Dragons
with Christmas...

59
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,327
...is like making a sandwich of grape jelly,
the best-tasting jelly...

60
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:52,055
...and petroleum jelly,
the worst-tasting jelly.

61
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,666
Okay, here we go.

62
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,894
"You find yourselves in the smoking
remains of Santa's village.

63
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,266
Clearly a great battle has taken place."

64
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:03,670
Oh, man, the first monster I see,
I'm going to sneak up behind him...

65
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:07,973
...whip out my wand
and shoot my magic all over his ass.

66
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:13,247
Do you hear yourself
when you say these things?

67
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:18,379
Okay, there are ogre tracks and
a trail of broken candy canes in the snow.

68
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,684
Sheldon, what do you do?

69
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,523
I signal my contempt for your cruel plan
to shove Christmas joy down my throat...

70
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,995
...by making a gesture that says,
"Get a load of this guy."

71
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:30,867
Fine, Howard, what do you do?

72
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:36,907
I follow the ogre tracks,
checking for secret doors along the way.

73
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,943
And you discover a secret door
leading to a dark corridor.

74
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,378
Let's make a plan. Spellcasters in the back,
warriors in the front.

75
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:48,145
Screw that noise, I'm going in.
Hang on, Santa, I'm coming for you.

76
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:53,955
Okay. You run into a room full of weapons,
hit a trip wire.

77
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,088
A cannon blows your face off.
You die, you're out of the game.

78
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,067
What? A cannon?

79
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,896
Am I really out of the game?

80
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,731
Lucky.

81
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,799
Okay, come on. Moving on.

82
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,841
Wait, doesn't anyone have
a rod of resurrection?

83
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,070
Because if you've got one, I need it bad.

84
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,917
Get in here with your rod
and give it to me.

85
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,789
Okay, you need to say these things
in your head before you say them out loud.

86
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,657
Hey, I don't mean to interrupt
your little game...

87
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:33,925
...but I thought you'd like to see what
you're missing out on. So, ahem, Bernadette?

88
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:44,769
Bernadette's wearing leopard-print pumps
and a racktastic red dress from Forever 21.

89
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,979
And there's Amy showing
all kinds of ankle...

90
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,979
...in an outfit I'm assuming
is from Forever 63.

91
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,284
And I myself...

92
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:09,397
...am wearing a little number that got me
out of two speeding tickets and jury duty.

93
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:14,639
I know they're making a rhetorical point,
I just don't know what it is.

94
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,536
See you, boys. We are going drinking.

95
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:20,110
Wait. Can I come with you?
My character died.

96
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:24,881
- Sorry, Raj. It's girls' night out.
- Maybe another time.

97
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,747
Okay.

98
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:30,313
Come on.

99
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,984
Girls' night. Girls' night. Ooh! Ooh!

100
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,262
How does he not hear that?

101
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,360
What's the plan?
We gonna teach our fellas a lesson...

102
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,701
...by getting stinking drunk,
luring strange men into the bathroom...

103
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,241
...and turning the toilet stall
into a temple of the senses?

104
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:53,906
- No.
- No.

105
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,846
Jeez. Who's Forever 63 now?

106
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:03,345
Can we get another bottle of champagne
for the table? Don't worry, it's my treat.

107
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,219
- Thanks.
- You should come to girls' night more often.

108
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:10,226
And not just because if you weren't here
this would be a can of Pabst.

109
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,524
Nothing makes me happier
than the chance to spoil a lady.

110
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,793
Just ask my dog. My vet says
if I give her any more foie gras...

111
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,233
...she's going to die of gout.

112
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,774
- Hey, let's help Raj meet a girl tonight.
- No, no, no, I'm fine.

113
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,606
Are we talking one-night stand
or do we wanna get him into a relationship?

114
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,748
Let's get him laid.

115
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,418
Stop it, you're ruining girls' night.

116
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:38,884
Raj, you're a great guy, you're in a bar
full of single women. Let us help you.

117
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,082
You're a real catch.

118
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,592
You're shy, but that doesn't mean
you shouldn't have someone in your life.

119
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,231
That's sweet of you,
but what can you do to help?

120
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,267
We'll nose around, see if we can find
a nice girl and then introduce you.

121
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:53,405
Okay. A couple of things.

122
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:57,304
Don't tell them I come from money,
I want them to love me for me.

123
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,073
They must be insanely hot.

124
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,276
Like nines or 10s.

125
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,116
Nines or 10s?

126
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:11,586
Okay, an eight is acceptable if she's willing
to bring another eight to the hot tub.

127
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,518
You'll take any woman
who'll have you, right?

128
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:15,955
In a New Delhi minute.

129
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,422
I don't remember you buying these
miniatures in my store.

130
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,593
Oh, uh, yeah. I got them on Amazon.

131
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,096
Sure. I get it.

132
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:30,265
Why support a friend when you can support
a multinational conglomerate...

133
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,105
...that is crushing the life
out of that friend?

134
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:37,112
I know, but when I shop online
I can do it on the toilet.

135
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,284
Have you seen my store?
The whole place is a toilet.

136
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,179
- Can we please move this along?
- Yeah, sorry.

137
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,690
Uh, you come to the end of the tunnel
and find a large chest.

138
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:53,025
What do you do? And Howard, do not say,
"I feel up the large chest."

139
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,727
Excuse me, I'm a married man now.
I wasn't going to say anything so juvenile.

140
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:01,533
- Great, what do you do?
- I walk up to the large chest...

141
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,197
...bury my face in it and go:

142
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,543
I open the chest.

143
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,513
It's locked, but suddenly the door
behind you slams shut...

144
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,210
...and now the walls of the room
start closing in.

145
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,085
That's not good. My character and I
both have claustrophobia.

146
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,556
Glowing letters appear on the chest
that read:

147
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,195
"If squashed to death
you wish not to be...

148
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:28,060
...sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory."
- Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav?

149
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,101
- Walls are getting closer.
- Oh, boy. Happy place, happy place.

150
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:34,205
Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia.

151
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,931
Ten seconds from getting crushed.

152
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,042
- Nine. Eight.
- What are we supposed to do?

153
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,939
- Seven. Six. Five.
- Wait, wait.

154
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,672
Svaty Vaclav is better known
as Good King Wenceslaus...

155
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,180
...from the Christmas carol.
- Never heard of it.

156
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,081
Must be the one Christmas song
not written by a Jewish guy.

157
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,550
- Three. Two.
- Somebody sing the damn song.

158
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:55,123
Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen

159
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:59,196
When the snow lay round about
Deep and crisp and even

160
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,525
Walls are getting slower.

161
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,067
Brightly shone the moon that night
Though the frost was cruel

162
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:09,003
When a poor man came in sight
Gath'ring winter fuel

163
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,306
- The walls stop. You're safe.
- That was amazing, Sheldon.

164
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,949
- How'd you know that?
- Simple.

165
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,086
I combined a well-known historical fact
about Bohemia...

166
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:24,120
...with the memory of my grandparents,
Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop...

167
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,781
...singing carols,
while I sat in front of the fire...

168
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,292
...and tried to build a high-energy particle
accelerator out of Legos.

169
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,893
- Okay, continuing the quest...
- Wait, there's still four more verses.

170
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,728
You don't sing a song and not finish it.

171
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:40,394
Hither, page, and stand by me
If thou know'st it, telling

172
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:44,009
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?

173
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,270
Brightly shone the moon that night
Though the frost was...

174
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,713
- It looks like he's doing pretty good.
- Of course he is.

175
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:00,290
That girl just got dumped by her boyfriend,
she's angry, she's drunk...

176
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,485
...and her favorite movie
is Slumdog Millionaire.

177
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,830
That is some low-hanging fruit.

178
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,633
Oh, here he comes.

179
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,530
- So, how'd it go?
- Great.

180
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,797
I bought her a couple of drinks
and she gave me her e-mail address.

181
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,998
Ooh!

182
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:20,635
"Jennifer at not even if you were
the last guy on Earth dot loser."

183
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:22,738
What?

184
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,212
I'm sorry, Raj.

185
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,408
Why can't I find someone?

186
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:30,055
I'm smart, I've got a cool job
and my naturally bronzed complexion...

187
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,680
...means I can pull off mustard yellow
in a way most guys can't.

188
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:40,366
- Aw, honey, it's not you, it's them.
- No, it's not. She was too beautiful for me.

189
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,867
- Why would you say that?
- It's true.

190
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,596
I'm always attracted to women I can't have.
I do it all the time.

191
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,740
I did the same thing with the two of you.

192
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,438
The two of them? I don't understand.

193
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,779
Well, uh, there was a time
when I had a thing for Penny.

194
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,611
I thought she was into me too.
She got drunk and naked...

195
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:03,949
...and climbed into bed with me.
But apparently, I misread those signals.

196
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,192
And you liked Bernadette also?

197
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,952
That was before Penny.

198
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:14,622
I make it a rule to only fall for
one of my friends' girlfriends at a time.

199
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,360
I'm very old-fashioned that way.

200
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:23,942
So at, uh, some point,
you probably had a thing for me too.

201
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,769
No. Not really.

202
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:35,080
- Come on, Raj, not even a little bit?
- Not that I can think of.

203
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,088
Think harder.

204
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:44,054
Nope. I guess the heart wants
what the heart wants.

205
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,961
Or in this case, doesn't. I mean, at all.

206
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,431
What?

207
00:12:54,874 --> 00:13:00,141
Ye who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing

208
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,336
Ba-da-bum!

209
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,307
Done?

210
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,112
I think the word you're looking for
is "bravo."

211
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:13,851
Okay, you leave the room and find yourself
standing before a pool of melted snowmen.

212
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:17,359
Melted snowmen? Are there carrots
and lumps of coal in the water?

213
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,658
- Uh, what's the difference?
- It's a game of the imagination, Leonard.

214
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,802
- Paint a picture.
- Fine. You leave the room and find yourself...

215
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,928
...standing before a pool of melted snowmen.
There are carrots and coal in the water.

216
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:31,508
Do we know what happened to the top hats
and the corncob pipes?

217
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:35,113
- You see those too.
- Oh, it's like I'm really there.

218
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:40,880
I gotta tell you,
this is the most holiday fun I've had...

219
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,988
...since my therapist
changed my anxiety medication...

220
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,784
...and I stopped caring about the blood
in my stool.

221
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,263
Good story.

222
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:56,633
- What're you drinking there? Little eggnog?
- Yes. Is there a problem?

223
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:01,364
No, it's nice to see you enjoying
a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmasy.

224
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,565
Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink?

225
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:09,780
Eggs are available all year round.
I've been known to enjoy this poolside.

226
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,185
Come on, Sheldon.
You know all the Christmas stories...

227
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,378
...and the carols, you've got
an eggnog mustache going on there.

228
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:19,251
Just admit it,
you're getting a little yuletide spirit.

229
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:23,521
Don't be silly. Christmas is a bunch of
baloney created by the tinsel industry.

230
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,528
Why is this so important to you?

231
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:30,725
I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid.
I'm tired of you sucking the joy out of them.

232
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:35,430
- What was so bad about them?
- I grew up in a house full of crazy academics.

233
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:39,806
Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies,
we had to leave him a research paper.

234
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:45,611
And in the morning, you could tell he'd been
there because the paper would be graded.

235
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:50,547
No wonder you love Christmas.
That sounds amazing.

236
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:55,387
It wasn't amazing.
I got a C-minus four years in a row.

237
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,052
I'm familiar with your work.
C-minus was your gift.

238
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:05,804
Amy, I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

239
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:10,135
It's fine. I'm used to being the girl
who never gets looked at twice.

240
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,367
I didn't have my first kiss until I was 22.

241
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,411
The guy only did it
so that I would give him back his insulin.

242
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,851
Sometimes the pancreas wants
what the pancreas wants.

243
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,721
Forget it.
I don't expect you guys to understand.

244
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,051
I understand.

245
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:30,718
In seventh grade, I played spin-the-bottle
and it landed on Alina Shankar.

246
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:35,162
She said if I came near her,
she would break the bottle and cut me.

247
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,664
You think that's bad?

248
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:41,067
In college, I passed out at a frat party
and woke up with more clothes on.

249
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,403
Sometimes I get so Ionely I sit
on my left hand until it goes numb...

250
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:54,109
...then I put it in my right hand and pretend
I'm holding hands with another person.

251
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,251
I do that too.

252
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,486
Sometimes the left hand tries
to cop a feel.

253
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,192
And I let it.

254
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:09,994
It's kind of nice to talk to someone who
understands what it feels like to be alone.

255
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,534
It is, isn't it?

256
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,138
But you're not alone anymore.
Now you've got Sheldon.

257
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:18,538
I do. And don't worry,
someday you'll have somebody too.

258
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:23,648
Thank you. I hope she's half as lovely
and amazing as you are.

259
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,546
Thank you, Rajesh.

260
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:28,977
He wants me, I'm good. We can go.

261
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,553
- Damn it.
- What?

262
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:37,685
Now that I know she doesn't like me,
I'm kind of into her.

263
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:44,830
All right, I think I cracked the code
to lower the drawbridge.

264
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,198
Great. Let's do it.

265
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,709
The drawbridge is lowering.

266
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,016
- My carpal tunnel's acting up.
- Play through the pain.

267
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,198
You did it. The drawbridge is down.

268
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,703
You cross the chasm
and find yourself in a small dungeon room.

269
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:26,743
And in the corner, chained to the wall,
you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus.

270
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:30,541
He says, "Ho, ho, help me."

271
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,914
Yes, we found Santa. Christmas is saved.

272
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,578
Don't ever tell my mother I said that.

273
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:42,357
I take out my skeleton key
and run to Santa to unchain him.

274
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:46,191
But first I cast a spell of paralysis
on Stuart and Howard.

275
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,697
- What are you doing?
- Can't talk, you're paralyzed.

276
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:52,862
I get right up in Santa's big, fat face
and say:

277
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,532
"Well, well, well, Jolly old Saint Nick,
we meet again.

278
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:02,112
I believe the last time we spoke was
in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas...

279
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,442
...when I was 5 years old, isn't that right?"

280
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,641
Okay.

281
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,720
My mother dragged me there
and plopped me down on your lap...

282
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,254
...and you asked me
what I wanted for Christmas.

283
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:16,884
I told you my Pop-Pop, because
that was the year my grandfather died.

284
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,428
I missed him and I wanted him back.

285
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,790
This is weird, right?

286
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:29,764
Pop-Pop was the only one in my family
who encouraged me to pursue science.

287
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,933
But you didn't bring him back, did you?

288
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,909
No. Instead, I got Lincoln Logs.

289
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,413
Now, you can build a lot of neat things
out of Lincoln Logs...

290
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,575
...but Pop-Pop ain't one of them.

291
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:45,189
And now you're here asking me
for something. To save you.

292
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:49,293
Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle.
But today's not your day.

293
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:53,761
I'm leaving you here to rot
and I hope the ogres feast on your bones.

294
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:57,333
I take the skeleton key,
toss it into the chasm...

295
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:02,065
...and on the way out give Santa a swift kick
in his bowl full ofjelly.

296
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,205
Okay.

297
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,176
So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed,
Santa's dead...

298
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,476
...and I picked this over having sex
with my girlfriend.

299
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:32,263
- Santa?
- Oh, hello, Sheldon.

300
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,630
You should be asleep.

301
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,776
Well, then you shouldn't have jingle bells
on your boots.

302
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,009
I've been wanting to talk to you.

303
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:46,412
I'm sorry I disappointed you
when you were a little boy.

304
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,647
I can do a lot of magical things...

305
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:55,452
...but unfortunately bringing
your Pop-Pop back isn't one of them.

306
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:01,790
- I understand.
- But I do have something special for you.

307
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,367
Close your eyes.

308
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,870
Oh, I hope it's a train.

309
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,101
Oh, it's better than a train.

310
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,305
Two trains?

311
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,038
Better.

312
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:22,983
- I'm getting three trains.
- Okay, open them.

313
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,796
This is for leaving me in the dungeon
to be eaten alive by ogres.

314
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,125
Now, hang on. In my defense...

315
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:37,132
Ho, ho, ho, you big dork.
