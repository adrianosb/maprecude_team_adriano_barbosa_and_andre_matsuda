00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,972
Turn your head back.

314
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,082
You rat bastard.

315
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:08,782
HOWARD:
Told you the sensor would work.

316
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,118
Hi.

317
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,318
You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.

318
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:15,861
Come on, I had to.
You see what he's like.

319
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:18,659
SHELDON:
Penny? Penny, I'm hungry.

320
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:21,028
It's okay, sweetie. Good news.

321
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:22,932
-Leonard's home.
-No.

322
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:25,665
-Here you go, good luck, bye.
-Oh, wait, wait.

323
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:30,608
SHELDON: Leonard? I'm hungry.
-Wait. Penny, take me with you.

324
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,713
SHELDON:
Leonard?

325
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:42,088
I want grilled cheese.

326
00:21:00,742 --> 00:21:04,576
Do you think Penny will come here
and take care of us?

327
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,915
I don't think Penny's
ever coming here again.

328
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:14,454
I'm very congested.

329
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,283
Yeah? So?

330
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:22,226
Can you go to the kitchen and get me
the turkey baster labeled, "Mucus"?

331
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:28,361
If I stand, I'll vomit.

332
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:31,896
Under the sink. Yellow Tupperware bowl.

333
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,392
