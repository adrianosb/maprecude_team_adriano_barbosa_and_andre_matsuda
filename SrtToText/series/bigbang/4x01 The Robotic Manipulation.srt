- What?
- What would a toilet look like in Atlantis?

00:10:18,496 --> 00:10:21,329
How would you flush it?
And when you did flush it...

Where did you get 171 men?

262
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:01,068
Simple extrapolation.

263
00:16:01,238 --> 00:16:04,435
In the three years that I've known you,
you were single for two.

264
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:07,406
During that time,

Whoa, wait, wait, wait.
I did not start dating at 15.

Now assuming the left side of a bell curve
peaking around the present...

...wearing same clothes
she wore the night before...

279
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:54,622
- I think you've made your point.
- So we multiply a 193...

280
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:57,317
...minus 21 men
before the loss of virginity...

281

309
00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:42,326
All right. All right.
Hang on, stay calm.

310
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:44,862
[ON PA]
I need an orderly with a wheelchair.

311
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:48,664
I've got a robot hand
grasping a man's penis out here.

312
00:18:50,407 --> 00:18:52,432
You think you could be
a little more discreet?

313
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:56,079
I'm sorry, we don't have a code
for robot hand grasping a man's penis.

314
00:18:57,381 --> 00:18:59,042
Why is it hooked up to a computer?

315
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:01,582
- It's what controls the arm.
- But it's frozen.

316
00:19:01,752 --> 00:19:04,414
Did you try turning it off
and back on again?

317
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:07,249
No, you see,
it's more complicated than that...

318
00:19:07,424 --> 00:19:09,153
No, wait!

319
00:19:15,732 --> 00:19:19,293
Winnie the Pooh
is out of the honey tree.

320
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:23,305
Now can we have cookies
and Hawaiian Punch?

321
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:32,109
You were right.
This was a very productive evening.

322
00:19:32,282 --> 00:19:36,241
I saw a whole new side
of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.

323
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,719
PENNY:
I did not have sex with 31 guys.

324
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:44,624
SHELDON: I'll be happy to check the math,
but numbers don't lie, Penny.

325
00:19:45,462 --> 00:19:49,660
In any event, now that Amy and I
have spent quality time together...

326
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:53,769
...I feel much more confident proceeding
to the next stage of our relationship.

327
00:19:53,937 --> 00:19:54,961
And that is?

328
00:19:55,138 --> 00:19:57,936
Using in vitro fertilization
and a surrogate uterus...

329
00:19:58,108 --> 00:20:01,407
...to gift humanity with our progeny.

330
00:20:01,945 --> 00:20:03,606
You're still on that?

331
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:08,683
In these uncertain times,
doesn't humanity deserve a gift?

332
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:13,281
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna
come at this in a whole new way.

333
00:20:13,457 --> 00:20:16,517
Sheldon, if you try to make a baby
with Amy in a Petri dish...

334
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:18,684
...I’m gonna tell your mother on you.

335
00:20:18,862 --> 00:20:20,454
Well, that's no threat.

336
00:20:20,631 --> 00:20:22,531
My mother's
always wanted a grandchild.

337
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:25,691
Really? Your deeply religious,
born-again Christian mother...

338
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:29,168
...wants a test-tube grandbaby
born out of wedlock?

339
00:20:32,376 --> 00:20:33,968
Curses.

340
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:38,604
If I'd thought of that in the first place,
I could've saved myself this whole night.

341
00:20:38,782 --> 00:20:43,014
Well, it's not that late. You could
still go out and look for number 32.

342
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,017
Good night.

343
00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:51,126
Hey, Howard. What's up?

344
00:20:51,295 --> 00:20:54,992
- I've decided not to procreate.
- Yeah, yeah, great.

345
00:20:56,233 --> 00:21:00,192
Howard, uh, slow down.
What do you mean, "It happened again"?

346
00:21:26,563 --> 00:21:28,554
