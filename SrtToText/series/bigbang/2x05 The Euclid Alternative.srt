Typically that's an indicator to,

- lf it were fine, the light wouldn't be on.

That's why the manufacturer installed
that light, to let you know it's not fine.

Everybody knows that's my spot.

159
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:20,640
Sheldon...

160
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,176
...you know that we care about you.

161
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:27,146
And it's because we care about you
that we've decided we have to speak up.

162
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:34,181
You're hurting the people
around you, sweetie.

163
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:37,986
So we've made you an appointment,
and we want you to keep it.

164
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:43,029
"Department of Motor Vehicles
New Driver Handbook"?

165
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:48,964
But I don't have a problem.

166
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:52,597
Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive.

167
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:55,107
This madness has to stop.

168
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,977
Penny's taking you to the DMV.
I'm going to bed.

169
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:01,878
- Why Penny?
- Because rock breaks scissors.

170
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:03,609
Good night.

171
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:06,815
- All right. Come on, Sheldon.
- Hold on.

172
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:08,217
I've one condition.

173
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:11,224
- What?
- We have to stop at Pottery Barn.

174
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:13,256
Okay.

175
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:15,226
And RadioShack.

176
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:16,857
Fine.

177
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,494
- And the comic-book store.
PENNY: All right.

178
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:22,961
I wanna go to the comic-book store.

179
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:44,752
I like comic books.

180
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,864
I still don't see
why I need a driver's license.

181
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:56,095
Albert Einstein
never had a driver's license.

182
00:10:56,706 --> 00:11:01,336
Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn't make me
wet myself at 40 miles an hour.

183
00:11:01,877 --> 00:11:04,812
Yeah, and I never wanted
to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts.

184
00:11:08,784 --> 00:11:12,652
You know, I gotta ask: Why didn't you
just get a license at 16 like everyone else?

185
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:15,518
I was otherwise engaged.

186
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,589
Doing what?

187
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,059
Examining perturbative amplitudes
in N = 4 supersymmetric theories...

188
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,926
...leading to a re-examination
of the ultraviolet properties...

189
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,469
...of multi-loop N = 8 supergravity
using modern twistor theory.

190
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:34,443
Well, how about when you were 17?

191
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,571
Take this to the testing area.
Name at the top.

192
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:40,181
Sign the bottom, answer
the questions, bring it back. Next.

193
00:11:46,822 --> 00:11:47,846
Application?

194
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:51,654
I'm actually more of a theorist.

195
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:56,187
The application in your hand.
Give it to her.

196
00:11:56,365 --> 00:11:57,832
Oh.

197
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:03,030
Take this to the testing area.
Name at the top.

198
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:05,901
Sign the bottom, answer the questions,
bring it back. Next.

199
00:12:06,075 --> 00:12:09,772
Excuse me, but I have some concerns
about these questions.

200
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:12,647
Look at the sign up there.

201
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,410
- Yes?
- Does it say, "I give a damn"?

202
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:21,046
- No.
- That's because I don't.

203
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,254
Just look.
See, this first question makes no sense.

204
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:28,056
Look, "How many car lengths should you
leave in front of you when driving?"

205
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,425
There's no possible way to answer that.

206
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:34,194
A car length is not
a standardized unit of measure.

207
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:36,868
Look at the sign.

208
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,534
- Sheldon, it's C. Just put down C.
- I don't need your help, Penny.

209
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,439
- Listen to that little girl, honey. Put C. Next.
SHELDON: No, no.

210
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:46,046
Wait, no, hang on.
Take a look at this next question.

211
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:49,707
Sheldon,
why are you arguing with the DMV?

212
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:52,217
How else are they going to learn?

213
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:55,857
Look, question two:

214
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,255
"When are roadways most slippery?"

215
00:12:58,427 --> 00:13:00,793
There are three answers,
none of which are correct.

216
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:04,990
The correct answer is, "When covered by
liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient...

217
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:07,931
...to static friction between the tire
and the road to zero.

218
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:11,334
But not so deep as to introduce
a new source of friction."

219
00:13:15,611 --> 00:13:18,136
Here's your learner's permit. Go away.

220
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:22,907
But I'm not done. I have many
additional concerns about these questions.

221
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:26,418
- Don't make me climb over this counter.
- All right, come on. Let's go.

222
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,684
WOMAN:
Next.

223
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:31,451
Aced it.

224
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:35,222
Okay.

225
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,957
That's it. Let's boot it up.

226
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:39,361
Booting.

227
00:13:40,135 --> 00:13:42,000
This is a state-of-the-art simulator.

228
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:44,765
I adapted from something
a friend designed for the Army.

229
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,840
Is that why I appear to be in Fallujah...

230
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:49,637
...behind the wheel
of an up-armored Humvee?

231
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,707
I haven't configured it yet.

232
00:13:52,882 --> 00:13:57,615

- No.

234

Here we go. Red 2006 Ford Taurus

00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,450
Ah, mm....

236
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,859
- What?
- Statistically, red cars...

237
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:11,556
...are stopped by police
far more often than any other color.

238
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:14,532
I don't want any hassles with the fuzz.

239
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,400
Fine, what color do you want?

240
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:21,509
You know the pale blue
of Luke Skywalker's lightsaber?

241
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:25,741
Before it was digitally remastered.

242
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,981
Black it is.

243
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,913
Okay. Now, what you wanna do first
is turn on the ignition and shift into drive.

244
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,081
I haven't fastened my seat belt yet.

245
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:41,224
Okay, fasten your seat belt.

246
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:49,937
Click.

247
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,934
- Are there air bags?
- You don't need air bags.

248
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:55,838
What if a simulated van rear-ends me?

249

is because I'm not meant to.
