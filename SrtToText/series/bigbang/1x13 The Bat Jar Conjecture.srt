His mother was human. His father
was Vulcan. They couldn't conceive.

Maybe they had to go to a clinic.
Can you imagine Spock's dad...

154
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:39,699
He just smiles
and eats macaroons out of his Bat-Jar.

155
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:44,302
He's using psychological warfare.
We must reply in kind.

156
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:47,135
I say we wait until he looks at us,
then laugh like:

157
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,676
"Yes, you are a smart
and strong competitor.

158
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:51,472
But we are also smart and strong...

159
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:55,083
...and we have a reasonable chance
of defeating you."

160
00:08:56,552 --> 00:08:58,486
How exactly would that laugh go?

161
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:03,157
Hee-hee-hee!

162
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,650
That sounds more like:

163
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:10,356
"We are a tall, thin woman who wants
to make a coat out of your dalmatians."

164
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:15,062
Guys, let's remember that Sheldon
is still our friend and my roommate.

165
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:16,262
So?

166
00:09:16,906 --> 00:09:18,931
So nothing. Let's destroy him.

167
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,734
SHELDON:
Gentlemen.

168
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:24,243
RAJESH:
Hee-hee-hee!

169
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:31,845
Okay, we're gonna need a strong fourth
for our team.

170
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:35,821
You know who is apparently very smart
is the girl who played TV's Blossom.

171
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,760
She got a Ph.D. in neuroscience
or something.

172
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:44,025
Raj, we're not getting TV's Blossom
to join our Physics Bowl team.

173
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:48,132
How about the girl from
The Wonder Years?

174
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:53,503
Gentlemen, I believe I've found the solution
to all our problems.

175
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:57,607
We can't ask Leslie Winkle.

176
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,372
Why? Because you slept together...

177
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:03,348
...and when she was done with you,
she discarded you like last night's chutney?

178
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:08,546
Yes.

179
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:13,284
-You gotta take one for the team.
-Yeah. Sack up, dude.

180
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,289
Fine.

181
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,860
Here I go, taking one for the team...

182
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,061
...in the sack.

183
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,637
-Hey, Leslie.
-Hi, guys.

184
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:29,141
Ahem. So, Leslie,
I have a question for you...

185
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:33,373
...and it might be a little awkward,
you know, given that l--

186
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,744
Hit that thing.

187
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:42,118
There's no reason to feel uncomfortable
because we've seen each other's faces...

188
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:45,818
...and naked bodies contorted
in the sweet agony of coitus.

189
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:51,163
There's not? Gee, because it sure sounds
like there should be.

190
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:55,767
Any aspects of our sexual relationship,
regarding your preferences...

191
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:59,374
...your idiosyncrasies, your performance,
are protected by the inherent...

192
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:02,636
-...confidentiality of the bedroom.
-That's all very comforting...

193
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:04,677
...but I'd like to get on my question now.

194
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,410
-Proceed.
-We are entering the Physics Bowl...

195
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,677
-...and we need a fourth.
-No, thanks.

196
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:14,016
I'm really busy with my like-sign dilepton
supersymmetry search.

197
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,091
Dilepton shmylepton, we need you.

198
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,020
Sorry.

199
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:21,519
Well, we tried.

200
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:26,031
We'll just have to face Sheldon
mano y mano y mano a mano.

201
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:28,466
Wait, you're going up against
Sheldon Cooper?

202
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:31,162
-Yes.
-That arrogant, misogynistic...

203
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,140
...doorknob that told me I should abandon
my work with high-energy particles...

204
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:38,576
...for laundry and childbearing?

205
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,477
She's in.

206
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,551
PENNY:
So how do you feel?

207
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:49,714
Nice and loose? Come to play?
Got your game face on?

208
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:52,922
-Are you ready?
ALL: Oh.

209
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:55,893
Yeah. You don't have to stay
for the whole thing.

210
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:58,761
Oh, no, no, I want to.
Sounds really interesting.

211
00:11:58,934 --> 00:11:59,958
Okay.

212
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:07,208
-Gentlemen.
-Sheldon.

213
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:10,504
-Sheldon.
-Hee-hee-hee.

214
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,744
Sheldon.

215
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,217
I'm just gonna sit down.

216
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:22,515
So is that your team?

217
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:24,291
Actually, I don't need a team.

218
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,419
I could easily defeat you single-handedly,
but the rules require four.

219
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:32,897
So may I introduce the third-floor janitor,
the lady from the lunch room and--

220
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:36,970
My Spanish is not good.
--either her son or her butcher.

221
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:38,834
And what about your team?

222
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,034
What rat have you recruited
to the S.S. Sinking Ship?

223
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:44,270
LESLlE:
Hello, Sheldon.

224
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:47,973
Leslie Winkle.

225
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,641
Yeah, Leslie Winkle.
The answer to the question:

226
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,550
"Who made Sheldon Cooper cry
like a little girl? "

227
00:12:54,457 --> 00:12:58,655
Yes, well, I'm polymerized tree sap,
and you're an inorganic adhesive.

228
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:02,628
So whatever verbal projectile you launch
in my direction is reflected off of me...

229
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:06,029
...returns on its original trajectory,
and adheres to you.

230
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,996
Oh, ouch.

231
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:12,134
Okay, if everyone could please
take your seats?

232
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:22,015
Here's your T-shirt.

233
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,453
PMS?

234
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:28,681
It's a couple days early.

235
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:30,382
No.

236
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,255
It stands for Perpetual Motion Squad.

237
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:35,420
Oh, right, of course.
What was I thinking?

238
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:42,532
Good afternoon, everyone,
and welcome to this year's Physics Bowl.

239
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,331
Today's preliminary match
features two great teams:

240
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:52,679
AA versus PMS.

241
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:54,839
All night long, y'all.

242
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:02,416
Okay, well, let's jump right in.
First question.

243
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:07,927
For 1 0 points. "What is the isospin
singlet partner of the pi-zero meson? "

244
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,189
[BUZZER SOUNDS]

245
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:11,196
-PMS?
-The eta meson.

246
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:12,629
Correct.

247
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:16,095
-Formal protest.
-On what grounds?

248
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,400
The Velcro on my wrist brace
caught on my shirt.

249
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:22,544
Denied. All right, for 1 0 points.

250
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:26,579
"What is the lightest element on Earth
with no stable isotope? "

251
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:27,875
[BUZZER SOUNDS]

252
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,109
-AA?
-And, of course, the answer is technetium.

253
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,015
Terrific.

254
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:35,949
Next question. "What is the force
between two uncharged plates...

255
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,956
...due to quantum vacuum fluctuation? "

256
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,151
[BUZZER SOUNDS]

257
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:41,091
-PMS?
-And Sheldon can suck on...

258
00:14:41,263 --> 00:14:43,128
-...the Casimir effect.
GABLEHAUSER: Correct.

259
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:51,437
"How does a quantum computer
factor large numbers? "

260
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:52,631
[BUZZER SOUNDS]

261
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,400
-PMS?
-Shor's algorithm.

262
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:55,601
GABLEHAUSER:
Correct.

263
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:02,948
Four-point-one-eight-five-five times 1 0
to the seventh ergs per calorie.

264
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:05,052
Prévost's theory of exchanges.

265
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:07,552
Lambda equals one over pi-R-squared N.

266
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:09,588
Seven hundred and sixty degrees Celsius.

267
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:12,818
The approximate temperature
of the young lady in the front row.

268
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:15,830
Mr. Wolowitz,
this is your second warning.

269
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,897
A sigma particle.

270
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:22,469
Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet
has a mass greater than the Earth.

271
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:24,265
GABLEHAUSER:
Correct.

272
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:32,813
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hold in my hand the final question.

273
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:40,220
The score now stands,
AA, 1 1 50, PMS, 1 1 75.

274
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:43,722
So for 1 00 points and the match...

275
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:48,386
...please turn your attention
to the formula on the screens.

276
00:15:48,564 --> 00:15:50,293
Solve the equation.

277
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,864
Holy crap.

278
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:56,497
What the hell is that?

279
00:15:56,672 --> 00:16:00,335
It looks like something they found
on the ship at Roswell.

280
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:04,172
-Come on, think. Leslie?
-It's not gonna work if you rush me.

281
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:08,146
-You have to let me get there.
-You are never gonna let that go, are you?

282
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:09,545
Ten seconds.

283
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:14,012
[BUZZER SOUNDS]

284
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:15,520
PMS?

285
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,718
Sorry, I panicked.

286
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:20,823
Then guess.

287
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:22,623
Um....

288
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:25,261
Eight.

289
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:31,399
Point four.

290
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:33,799
I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

291
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:37,935
AA, if you can answer correctly,
the match is yours.

292
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,381
He doesn't have it. He's got squat.

293
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:55,621
AA, I need your answer.

294
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,622
[BUZZER SOUNDS]

295
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,961
The answer is minus eight pi alpha.

296
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:02,069
Hang on a second.
That's not our answer.

297
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:04,205
-What are you doing?
-Answering question.

298
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:06,568
Winning Physics Bowl.

299
00:17:08,043 --> 00:17:10,011
How do you know anything
about physics?

300
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:14,582
Here, I am janitor.
In former Soviet Union, I am physicist.

301
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:16,881
Leningrad Politechnika.

302
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:19,217
Go, Polar Bears.

303
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,648
That's a delightful little story.

304
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:26,090
Our arrangement was
you sit and not say anything.

305
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:28,786
-I answer the questions.
-You didn't answer question.

306
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:32,229
Hey, look. Now, maybe you have democracy
now in your beloved Russia...

307
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:35,268
...but on this Physics Bowl team,
I rule with an iron fist.

308
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:36,734
Ow!

309
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:39,397
AA, I need your official answer.

310
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:41,634
-It's not what he said.
-Then what is it?

311
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,971
-I want a different question.
-You can't.

312
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,340
-Formal protest.
-Denied.

313
00:17:45,514 --> 00:17:46,981
Informal protest.

314
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,342
Denied.

315
00:17:49,518 --> 00:17:52,612
-I need your official answer.
-No, I decline to provide one.

316
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:56,087
That's too bad because the answer
your teammate gave was correct.

317
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,993
That's your opinion.

318
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:04,757
-All right, the winner of the match is--
-Hang on.

319
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:09,729
Sheldon, is proving you are single-handedly
smarter than everyone else so important...

320
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:13,363
...that you would rather lose by yourself
than win as part of a team?

321
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,844
I didn't understand the question.

322
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,771
-Go ahead.
-The winner is PMS.

323
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:00,982
Sorry, somebody's sitting there.

324
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,620
-Who?
-My Physics Bowl trophy.

325
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,661
That trophy is meaningless.
I forfeited, therefore you did not win.

326
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,892
-I know someone who would disagree.
-Who?

327
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,400
My Physics Bowl trophy.

328
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,767
"Leonard is so smart.

329
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:21,603
-Sheldon who? "
-All right, that is just very immature.

330
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:22,937
You're right. I'm sorry.

331
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:25,409
"I'm not!"

332
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:29,210
-Okay, new contest.
LEONARD: What are you doing?

333
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:33,548
I am settling, once and for all,
who is the smartest around here.

334
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:35,349
-Okay? Are you ready?
-Absolutely.

335
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:36,991
-Bring it on.
PENNY: Okay.

336
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:41,790
"Marsha, Jan and Cindy were
the three daughters in what TV family? "

337
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,326
The Brady Bunch.

338
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,099
Okay.

339
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:54,106
"Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth
as the lead singer in what group? "

340
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,812
The Brady Bunch?

341
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:03,942
Van Halen.

342
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:08,116
All right. "Madonna was married
to this Ridgemont High alum."

343
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:12,655
Oh, my God. Sean Penn.

344
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:15,228
How do you know these things?

345
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,998
I go outside and I talk to people.

346
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,497
Okay, here.
"What actor holds the record...

347
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:25,504
...for being named People magazine's
Sexiest Man Alive? "

348
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:28,399
-William Shatner.
-Wait.

349
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,076
I don't think it's Shatner.

350
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:34,511
Then it's gotta be Patrick Stewart.

351
00:20:37,286 --> 00:20:40,153
-No.
-Formal protest.

352
00:20:41,723 --> 00:20:44,851
All right. "Singer who sang
'Oops!...I Did It Again'? "

353
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:51,265
Okay.

354
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:54,932
"Tweety bird thought he saw a what? "

355
00:20:58,974 --> 00:21:00,874
Romulan.

356
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:08,007
Yes. He thought he saw a Romulan.
