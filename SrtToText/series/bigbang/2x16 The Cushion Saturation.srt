00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:58,851
Yeah, well, before they went out of
business, I bought 4000 containers.

316
00:19:00,455 --> 00:19:02,685
I keep them in the trunk of my car.

317
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,056
But--

318
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:08,619
Oh, this changes everything.

319
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:13,132
I thought that might take
his mind off the cushion.

320
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:16,635
What's real? What isn't?
How can I know?

321
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,200
- You did make that up, right?
- Oh, God, I wish I had.

322
00:19:23,478 --> 00:19:24,877
- Leonard?
- Yeah, buddy?

323
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:26,776
I still don't like this cushion.

324
00:19:31,653 --> 00:19:33,052
Okay, first of all...

325
00:19:33,222 --> 00:19:36,385
- ...Penny, thank you for coming.
- Oh, thanks for the shoes.

326
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:40,124
Penny is an amazing shot. I think
we have a chance to win this week.

327
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:42,695
- What's the plan?
- Okay. Now, we all run out...

328
00:19:42,865 --> 00:19:45,595
...Sheldon and I will cut to the left
behind these trees.

329
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,736
Raj, Howard and Leslie
flank to the right behind the rocks.

330
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:52,396
We'll all have a great view as Penny
runs out and kills everyone in sight.

331
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:55,407
All right, just one thing before we start.

332
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:57,169
What is it, Sheldon?

333
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:01,342
What the hell?

334
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,478
That was for my cushion.

335
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:07,053
Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.

336
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:12,285
I'm sorry, Leonard.
But revenge is a dish best served cold.

337
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:15,396
Screw that.

338
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:19,493
She can't shoot me. She's dead.

339
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:22,396
He's right. You can't.

340
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,744
Well, if we're going to descend
into anarchy....

341
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:38,109
Okay. See you.

342
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:40,848
Where are you going?

343
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:43,457
Surrender, then Denny's.

344
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,512
