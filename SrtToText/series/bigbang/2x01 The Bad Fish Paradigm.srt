1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:03,315
So, what you're eating
is not technically yogurt.

2
00:00:03,486 --> 00:00:05,750
It doesn't have enough
live acidophilus cultures.

3
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:09,153
It's really just ice milk
with carrageenan added for thickness.

4
00:00:09,325 --> 00:00:14,160
- Well, that's very interesting.
- It's also not pink and has no berries.

5
00:00:15,465 --> 00:00:17,831
Yeah, but it doesn't really
answer my question.

6
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:20,629
- What was your question again?
- Do you want some?

7
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:22,294
Ah.

8
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:24,901
- Right. No. I'm lactose intolerant.
- Right.

9
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:27,202
- So gas.
- Yeah, got it.

10
00:00:28,144 --> 00:00:30,840
Well, good night.

11
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:48,562
- What are you doing?
- There was a draft.

12
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,497
PENNY:
I didn't feel a draft.

13
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:55,601
- Why don't we just go into your--?
- Oh, yeah.

14
00:00:55,772 --> 00:00:57,672
Maybe we should
slow things down a little.

15
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:00,366
No, I didn't mean
to go into your apartment to go fast.

16
00:01:00,543 --> 00:01:02,170
No, I know.

17
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,505
I know what you meant.
It's just this is only our first date.

18
00:01:05,682 --> 00:01:06,740
Okay. Sure. No problem.

19
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:09,180
Why don't we just figure out
where we're going...

20
00:01:09,352 --> 00:01:11,479
...and when we want to get there?

21
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:15,522
And then rate of speed
equals distance over time.

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,360
Solve for R.

23
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:22,021
Or we could just wing it.

24
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:25,034
That might work too.

25
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,727
- Good night, Leonard.
- Good night.

26
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,673
He's coming. Screen saver.

27
00:01:39,315 --> 00:01:41,306
Oh, hey, Leonard.

28
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:44,078
- How was your date?
- Bite me.

29
00:01:46,256 --> 00:01:49,783
Sheldon, how could you just sit there
and let them spy on me?

30
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,983
They were clever.

31
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:54,528
They exploited my complete lack of interest
in what you were doing.

32
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,834
You should thank us.
When future generations try to determine...

33
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:01,630
...why your relationship with Penny
crashed and burned...

34
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:04,740
...this right here is the black box.

35
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:07,706
What are you talking about?
The date went fine.

36
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,708
She said she wants to slow things down.

37
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,609
Okay, so she said
she wants to slow things down.

38
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:16,616
It's like saying,
"I'm really enjoying this meal.

39
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:19,619
I'm going to slow down and savor it."

40
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:23,316
No, it's like, "This fish tastes bad...

41
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,995
...so I'm gonna slow down
and spit it out."

42
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:30,997
- You being the fish.
- I'm not the fish.

43
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:32,930
Oh, really?
Did you make a second date?

44
00:02:33,102 --> 00:02:38,233
- Well, no. We sort of decided to wing it.
- Oh, even I know that's lame.

45
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,232
Okay. All right.
Let's assume your hypothesis.

46
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,938
We went to dinner, we talked,
we laughed, we kissed.

47
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:46,513
Where could I have gone wrong?

48
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:49,846
Think back, Leonard.
The littlest things can set women off.

49
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:54,080
Like, "Hey, the waitress is hot. I bet
we could get her to come home with us."

50
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,985
Or, "How much does your mom weigh?
I wanna know what I'm getting into."

51
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:02,598
- I didn't say anything like that.
- Good, because they don't work.

52
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,234
They don't care for it
if you stare at them and hyperventilate.

53
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,768
Sadly, that's my home-run swing.

54
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,433
Look, everything went fine.

55
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:15,635
I didn't even have to refer
to my impromptu conversation starters.

56
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:18,144
That woman across the hall is into me.

57
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,339
Let's go to the tape.

58
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:24,445
Look at her reaction
to the good-night kiss.

59
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,990
No change in respiration, pupils undilated,
no flushing of the chest.

60
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:31,183
Nice close-up, by the way.

61
00:03:31,527 --> 00:03:34,655
Interesting. Her jaws are clenched.
No tongue access.

62
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:38,164
Clearly a bad sign
amongst mating humans.

63
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:40,365
That's not a bad sign.

64
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:44,131
Please. You might as well have been
two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.

65
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:47,535
And the worst sign of all
is you're here and not there.

66
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,202
I'm not there,
because I'm taking things slow.

67
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:54,839
Which, by the way, compared to you guys,
approaches warp speed.

68
00:03:56,085 --> 00:03:59,077
And take down that camera.

69
00:04:00,623 --> 00:04:03,592
He was a lot more fun
when he had no hope.

70
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:08,196
Give him time.

71
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,091
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Penny.

72
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:47,134
Yeah, FYI, the hot water is inadequate
on Machine 2, so colors only.

73
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:50,363
Four is still releasing the fabric softener
too early in the cycle.

74
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,873
- So I'd avoid using that for your delicates.
- Thanks.

75
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,805
Well, good Lord.

76
00:04:57,981 --> 00:05:01,747
Why don't you just take your clothes down
to the river and beat them with a rock?

77
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:09,083
Sheldon, may I ask you a question?

78
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:13,221
I would prefer that you not,
but I won't go so far as to forbid it.

79
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,061
All right, I heard "yes," so....

80
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,495
Okay, here's my question:

81
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:23,668
Has Leonard ever dated,
you know, a regular girl?

82
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:28,242
Well, I assume you're not referring
to digestive regularity.

83
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:32,778
Because I've come to learn
that such inquiries are inappropriate.

84
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:38,476
No, I meant has he ever been involved
with someone who wasn't a brainiac?

85
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:40,849
Oh! Well, a few years ago...

86
00:05:41,024 --> 00:05:45,085
...he did go out with a woman
who had a Ph.D. in French literature.

87
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:50,594
- How is that not a brainiac?
- Well, for one thing, she was French.

88
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,196
For another, it was literature.

89
00:06:01,177 --> 00:06:02,644
So....

90
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,210
Do you think that if Leonard
and I keep dating...

91
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:08,816
...he'll eventually get bored with me?

92
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,782
- That depends.
- On what?

93
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:19,861
Do you have a working knowledge
of quantum physics?

94
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:21,291
No.

95
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,455
Do you speak Klingon?

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,024
No.

97
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:27,926
- You know any card tricks?
- Okay.

98
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:34,299
I get it. Leonard has no business
being involved with a waitress/actress...

99
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:39,005
...who felt so insecure, that she lied to him
about finishing community college.

100
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:40,706
Why would you lie about that?

101
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:43,647
He was going on about this college
and that grad school...

102
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,312
...and I didn't want him to think
I was some kind of stupid loser.

103
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,654
You thought the opposite of "stupid loser"
was "community-college graduate"?

104
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:59,057
There are a lot of successful people
in this country...

105
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:01,066
...who are community-college graduates.

106
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:03,467
Yeah, but you are neither.

107
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:07,672
Right. Okay, look,
this is between you and me.

108
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,938
You cannot tell Leonard any of this.

109
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:15,015
- You're asking me to keep a secret?
- Yeah.

110
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,344
Well, I'm sorry.

111
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,750
You would've had to express that desire
before revealing the secret...

112
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:23,881
...so that I could choose whether I wanted
to accept the covenant of secret-keeping.

113
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,121
You can't impose a secret
on an ex post facto basis.

114
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:30,922
What?

115
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,399
Secret-keeping is a complicated endeavor.
One has to be concerned...

116
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,734
...not only about what one says, but about
facial expressions, autonomic reflexes.

117
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:40,473
When I try to deceive...

118
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:45,342
...I myself have more nervous tics
than a Lyme disease research facility.

119
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,644
It's a joke.

120
00:07:51,821 --> 00:07:55,621
It relies on the homonymic relationship
between tick, the bloodsucking arachnid...

121
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,259
...and tic, the involuntary
muscular contraction.

122
00:07:58,427 --> 00:07:59,826
[CHUCKLES]

123
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,059
I made it up myself.

124
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:11,897
Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied,
I will absolutely die of embarrassment.

125
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:15,066
- Physiologically impossible.
- Oh, Sheldon, please.

126
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,235
Look, I'm asking you as a friend.

127
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:20,946
You're saying that friendship
contains within it...

128
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:23,677
...an inherent obligation
to maintain confidences?

129
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:27,289
- Well, yeah.
- Interesting.

130
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:30,257
One more question.
Perhaps I should've led with this:

131
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,485
When did we become friends?

132
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:38,865
I.e., I couldn't become Green Lantern unless
I was chosen by the Guardians of Oa.

133
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:42,027
Given enough startup capital
and an adequate research facility...

134
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:44,230
...I could be Batman.

135
00:08:48,177 --> 00:08:49,940
- You could be Batman?
- Sure.

136
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,170
[IN DEEP VOICE]
I'm Batman.

137
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:52,371
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
See?

138
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:55,841
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

139
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:57,610
- Hi, Penny.
- Hey.

140
00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:02,351
If you're not doing anything Friday night,
I thought we could go see a movie.

141
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:05,187
You know, I think I have the dinner shift
on Friday.

142
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:08,057
- Okay. What about Saturday?
- You know, I'm not sure.

143
00:09:08,231 --> 00:09:11,223
The manager hasn't posted the schedule.
How about I let you know?

144
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,424
- Great.
- Okay.

145
00:09:12,602 --> 00:09:18,199
So you just let me know when you know.
Okay, so-- Oh, God, I am the bad fish.

146
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,036
- What did I do wrong?
- Why are you asking me?

147
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:26,810
I have no information
about your interactions with Penny...

148
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,918
...nor do I have any method
of learning such things.

149
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:34,188
LEONARD: What does that mean?
- Nothing.

150
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:37,554
You seem to be implying a back channel
between me and Penny...

151
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:40,423
- ...where, obviously, none exists.
- No, I didn't.

152
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:43,861
I just think you need to be careful
how you phrase things, sir.

I can't keep your secret, Penny.

I'm constitutionally incapable.

172

That's why I was refused clearance
for a government research fellowship...

What do you mean

There doesn't have to be a reason.

- Yeah, there kind of does.
- Not necessarily.

This is a classic example
of Münchausen's trilemma.

Either the reason is predicated on a series
of sub-reasons leading to regression...

...or it tracks back to axiomatic statements,
or it's ultimately circular...

because I'm moving out.

Penny thinks I'm too smart for her.
That's ridiculous.

304
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,632
I know.

305
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:57,644
Most of your work is extremely derivative.

306
00:19:57,813 --> 00:20:00,281
And don't worry, that's not a secret.

307
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:02,875
Everybody knows.

308
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:10,051
- Hi.
- Yeah, hi. Listen.

309
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:13,388
I know what's been bothering you about us,
and I have the answer.

310
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:16,929
- What are you talking about?
- I wanna say that it's not Sheldon's fault.

311
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:18,964
He tried very hard to keep your secret.

312
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:22,626
If Howard hadn't drugged him,
he would've taken it to his grave.

313
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,663
- He told you?
- Yes, but it's okay.

314
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:29,572
Now that we know what the problem is,
there's a simple solution.

315
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:35,377
- Pasadena City College?
- A place for fun, a place for knowledge.

316
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:42,485
See, this man here is playing Hacky Sack,
and this girl's gonna be a paralegal.

317
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,756
Oh. I get it,
because Dr. Leonard Hofstadter...

318
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:49,898
...can't date a girl
without a fancy college degree.

319
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:53,757
Well, it's really not that fancy.
It's just a city college.

320
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:57,434
Right, but I have to have
some sort of degree to date you?

321
00:20:57,606 --> 00:21:01,508
- That doesn't matter to me at all.
- So it's fine with you if I'm not smart?

322
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,907
Absolutely.

323
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,283
Okay, this time,
I know where I went wrong.

324
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:15,820
Bite me.

325
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:46,344
