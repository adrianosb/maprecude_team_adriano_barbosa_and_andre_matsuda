1
00:00:04,118 --> 00:00:09,146
SHELDON: Why hast thou forsaken me,
oh, deity, whose existence I doubt?

2
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:12,819
Here, breathe into this bag.

3
00:00:14,195 --> 00:00:17,961
- What's going on?
SHELDON: They stole everything, Leonard.

4
00:00:18,132 --> 00:00:19,326
Everything.

5
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:23,227
- Are you the roommate?
- Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?

6
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:25,497
Your friend called 911
to report a robbery.

7
00:00:25,673 --> 00:00:27,368
Oh, my God, what did they get?

8
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,633
What didn't they get?

9
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:32,540
They got my enchanted weapons,
my Vicious Gladiator armor...

10
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:37,343
...my Wand of Untainted Power
and all my gold.

11
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:39,679
You called the police...

12
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:43,187
...because someone hacked
your "World of Warcraft" account?

13
00:00:43,357 --> 00:00:44,722
What choice did I have?

14
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:47,918
The mighty Sheldor,
level 85 blood elf...

15
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:49,858
...hero of the Eastern Kingdoms...

16
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,694
...has been picked clean
like a carcass in the desert sun.

17
00:00:55,536 --> 00:00:57,766
Plus, the FBI hung up on me.

18
00:00:57,938 --> 00:00:59,200
[SHELDON HYPERVENTILATING]

19
00:00:59,373 --> 00:01:01,204
Into the bag.

20
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:04,902
They took my battle ostrich.

21
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:08,344
- Oh, no, not Glenn.
- Yes. Glenn.

22
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:11,314
Only bird I ever loved.

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,085
Good luck, fellas.

24
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:15,779
Oh, thank you, officer.

25
00:01:15,956 --> 00:01:18,550
Wait a minute.
You're not going to do anything?

26
00:01:18,726 --> 00:01:21,024
- Mr. Cooper, there's nothing...
- Dr. Cooper.

27
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,759
Seriously?

28
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:27,462
Not the kind with access to drugs.

29
00:01:28,736 --> 00:01:32,069
Fine. Dr. Cooper,
I'm sorry for your loss...

30
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,609
...but the Pasadena Police Department
doesn't have jurisdiction in Pandora.

31
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:40,213
That's from Avatar.

32
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,941
"World of Warcraft" takes place
in Azeroth.

33
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:47,144
Goodness gracious,
how are you allowed to carry a gun?

34
00:01:47,955 --> 00:01:51,721
Can you at least refer me
to a rogue ex-cop?

35
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:53,892
What?

36
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:57,622
One who was drummed off the force
because he refused to play by the rules.

37
00:01:57,798 --> 00:02:02,462
And now he hires himself out to impose
his own brand of rough justice?

38
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:06,128
No.

39
00:02:07,107 --> 00:02:09,337
Thank you, officer.

40
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,910
It's all gone. All gone.

41
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:15,339
- I'm really sorry, Sheldon.
- What kind of world do we live in...

42
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:19,384
...where a man would take
another man's battle ostrich?

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,114
I don't know.

44
00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:26,025
This act of aggression must be met
with swift and cruel ferocity.

45
00:02:26,193 --> 00:02:30,630
It is time to cry havoc
and let slip the dogs of war.

46
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:33,760
I'm on it.

47
00:02:36,604 --> 00:02:39,630
Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is Howard there?

48
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:42,207
Okay, thanks.

49
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:46,505
That particular dog of war
will have to call you back after his bath.

50
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,277
See if Raj is done with Pilates.

51
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:19,941
Three thousand hours.

52
00:03:20,114 --> 00:03:25,051
Three thousand hours clicking on that
mouse, collecting weapons and gold.

53
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:29,047
It's almost as if
it was a huge waste of time.

54
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,782
They knew what they were doing.

55
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,655
He got in and out of your account
in under 15 minutes...

56
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:38,025
...transferred all your stuff,
didn't leave a digital fingerprint.

57
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:41,065
Oh, there isn't enough chamomile tea
in the world...

58
00:03:41,268 --> 00:03:43,896
...to quell the rage in my heart.

59
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:48,172
I'm talking to an orc under the bridge
in Thunder Bluff...

60
00:03:48,342 --> 00:03:51,209
...says if we pay him,
he'll help us track down your things.

61
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:53,369
- Can we trust him?
- I should say so.

62
00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:57,347
He appears to be a member
of the Nigerian royal family.

63
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,353
Whoa, somebody's auctioning off
a jeweled ostrich bridle.

64
00:04:02,523 --> 00:04:03,854
No, Glenn's was leather.

65
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,150
He was a simple ostrich.

66
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:09,887
Is. Is. I haven't given up hope.

67
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,328
- Hey.
- Hey, Penny.

68
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,596
- We're in the middle of a crisis here.
- Oh, I know. Bernadette told me.

69
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:20,797
I'm sorry, Sheldon,
I know that game meant a lot to you.

70
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:22,674
That game?

71
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:27,772
Excuse me, Penny,
but "Doodle Jump" is a game.

72
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:30,508
"Angry Birds" is a game.

73
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:35,849
"World of Warcraft" is a massively
multiplayer online role-playing...

74
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:37,854
All right, technically it's a game.

75
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:43,051
Bad news.
The Nigerian prince may be a fraud.

76
00:04:44,198 --> 00:04:46,894
Okay, I brought you a day-old
cheesecake to cheer you up.

77
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:51,737
Stale pastry is hollow succor
to a man who is bereft of ostrich.

78
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:56,740
- Just say thank you.
- I thought I just did.

79
00:04:58,245 --> 00:05:00,372
All right, see you later.

80
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:01,840
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hi.

81
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:04,716
I was just dropping off a cheesecake
to Sheldon.

82
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:07,046
He was robbed
of a bunch of imaginary crap...

83
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:09,553
...that's useful
in a make-believe place.

84
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:12,090
I don't know what that means.

85
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:14,727
Yeah, well, sadly, I do.

86
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:20,458
Did you know Priya took Leonard
Rollerblading at the beach?

87
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:22,260
Can you believe that?

88
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,300
I feel like I'm supposed to say
"that bitch"...

89
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:27,770
...but I don't have
enough information.

90
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:32,809
I am the one who spent two years
trying to get him to go to the beach.

91
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,916
He was so phobic about stepping
on medical waste, I had to carry him.

92
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:39,614
I took Howard to the beach once.

93
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:43,154
He almost burst into flames
like a vampire.

94
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:48,489
What's the thanks I get for turning
Leonard into quality boyfriend material?

95
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:50,755
I have to tiptoe
around his new girlfriend.

96
00:05:52,032 --> 00:05:53,431
I think you're on.

97
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:56,432
That bitch.

98
00:05:57,704 --> 00:06:00,366
You want some coffee liqueur
on your ice cream?

99
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,704
Here's the alcohol and drug peer pressure
mother warned me about.

100
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:07,670
I was starting to think
it was never gonna happen.

101
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:09,915
Yes, please.

102
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:13,152
Should've seen Leonard when we met.
No eye contact.

103
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,721
He was either looking up at the ceiling
or down at his shoes.

104
00:06:16,924 --> 00:06:17,948
I'm drunk.

105
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:23,686
For the first months
whenever I'd take off my bra...

106
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:27,698
...he would giggle and say,
"Oh, boy, my breast friends."

107
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:32,728
If it makes you feel better,
I'm never speaking to Priya again.

108
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,465
No, don't do that.
No reason to be mean to her.

109
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,810
This may be the alcohol talking,
but I believe there is.

110
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:43,814
Are you familiar with the study
of Tanzanian chimpanzees...

111
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:46,919
...by Nishida and Hosaka
out of Kyoto University?

112
00:06:47,087 --> 00:06:50,147
No, but I can name
all the Kardashians.

113
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:53,349
Primates such as ourselves
have a natural instinct...

114
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:55,893
...to ostracize ill-mannered
members of the troop.

115
00:06:56,063 --> 00:06:58,190
Bernadette's urge to shun, scowl...

116
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:01,994
...or fling her waste at Priya
is hardwired into her DNA.

117
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:05,938
I don't have an urge
to fling my waste.

118
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:08,904
Believe me, it's there. We all have it.

119
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:11,270
Hit me with some more booze
and I'll show you.

120
00:07:14,114 --> 00:07:15,240
All right, here we are.

121
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:19,010
This is the tavern where all
the black market weapon trades go down.

122
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,518
I don't think my character
should be in a place like this.

123
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:24,680
Everyone's undressing her
with their eyes.

124
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:28,858
Maybe if you stop dropping your sword
and bending over to pick it up.

125
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:34,189
- What exactly are we looking for?
- Redheaded troll by the name of Glumly.

126
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:36,859
According to this,
if you wanna move stolen goods...

127
00:07:37,037 --> 00:07:39,597
...and it's after school hours,
he's your guy.

128
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:43,300
Is this going to take much longer?
We were gonna spend some time together.

129
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,738
We are. In the meantime...

130
00:07:44,912 --> 00:07:47,574
...you're welcome to whip up
a character and join us.

131
00:07:48,215 --> 00:07:49,807
Seriously?

132
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:53,646
Well, you have to put in
a credit card number, but it's fun.

133
00:07:54,221 --> 00:07:55,552
Maybe I should just go home.

134
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:58,782
- Our troll walked in. I got him.
- We got him. We're almost done.

135
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:01,084
How do you guys wanna play this?

136
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:05,095
Be ruthless. Tell him if he doesn't start
talking, we'll register a complaint...

137
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:07,665
...with his Internet service provider.

138
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:11,237
Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet
from his cable company?

139
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:15,603
He could lose his HBO and all
their delightful original programming.

140
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,470
I don't care. I'm losing it, man.

141
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:23,341
Why don't we play this smart?
Try a little good goblin, bad goblin.

142
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,450
Oh, dear Lord.

143
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:27,450
No, I think we have to be more subtle.

144
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:30,784
Okay, I see where this is going.

145
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,051
Fine, I'll have sex with him.

146
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:38,322
That's not where it was going.

147
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:42,268
Good, because I would hate that.

148
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,863
Leonard, you're busy,
let's talk tomorrow.

149
00:08:46,073 --> 00:08:48,166
Oh, wait, hang on. Are you upset?

150
00:08:48,342 --> 00:08:51,607
No, no, I think it's sexy
to date a boy trapped in a man's body.

151
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,642
Good, good.
I'll tell you what happens.

152
00:08:57,584 --> 00:09:00,075
People think I don't get sarcasm.

153
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:06,184
Well, well, well.

154
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:09,021

00:18:15,475 --> 00:18:17,636
It'd be swell if they had a train.

308
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:25,274
Thank you, Penny.

309
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:27,652
No problem.

310
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:32,190
So I think it's interesting you didn't
call your girlfriend to come get you.

311
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:34,654
I kind of told her I was working.

312
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:38,353
So you lied to her. Also interesting.

313
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:42,995
She doesn't really understand the whole
"Warcraft" adventure-role-playing thing.

314
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:46,605
Well, doesn't matter if she gets it,
as long as she's pretty.

315
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:50,437
This one's funny, Leonard.

316
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,669
How come you couldn't
make it work with her?

317
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,111
Did you at least get
Sheldon's fake stuff back?

318
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:59,979
No, we failed in our noble quest.

319
00:19:00,153 --> 00:19:04,385
- How come?
- Todd Zarnecki was mean.

320
00:19:04,724 --> 00:19:06,021
All right, hang on.

321
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,383
What are you doing?

322
00:19:07,594 --> 00:19:11,291
I'm gonna show you
how we finish a quest in Nebraska.

323
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:15,090
Oh, Beyoncé.

325
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,865
This ain't no Beyoncé.

326
00:19:29,382 --> 00:19:31,043
Now what?

327
00:19:31,684 --> 00:19:34,710
- Give his stuff back.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

328
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:36,145
Well, then good news.

329
00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:40,816
Today's the day a girl's finally gonna
touch you in your little special place.

330
00:19:44,197 --> 00:19:46,995
- Now, give him his stuff back.
- Okay.

331
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,224
We did it!

332
00:19:51,404 --> 00:19:52,701
I said, we.

Oh, hold the door.

00:20:01,848 --> 00:20:02,872
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

335
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:06,883
- Going to see Leonard?
- Yes.

336
00:20:07,854 --> 00:20:09,378
- How have you been?
- Fine.

337
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:12,149
- You?
- Very well, thank you.

338
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:55,300
- All right, well, great seeing you.
- Yeah, you too.

339
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:02,105
Amy's right.
I do wanna fling my poop at her.
