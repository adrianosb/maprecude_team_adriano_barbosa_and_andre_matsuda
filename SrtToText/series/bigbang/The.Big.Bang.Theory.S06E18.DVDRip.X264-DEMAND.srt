1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,571
I know you guys don't want to do this,
but we have no choice.

2
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,469
You can either bitch and whine
or we can get it over with.

3
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:11,974
- I got whine.
- I got the B-word.

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,145
Yeah, well, it's in our contract
to serve on a university committee.

5
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,716
And frankly,
this is one I believe in, okay? Here:

6
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:21,683
Encouraging more women
to pursue a career in the sciences.

7
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,551
Come on, if I was good
at convincing women to do stuff...

8
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:27,784
...I wouldn't have spent
so much of my 20's in the shower. Heh.

9
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:32,391
If you ask me,
this whole thing is a waste of our time.

10
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:35,500
- Helping women?
- Yeah, helping anyone.

11
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,731
People should take care of themselves.

12
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:42,397
Oh, like yesterday when you
made me drive you to the dry cleaners...

13
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,338
...the pharmacy and the post office?

14
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,945
I'm not saying people can't use tools.

15
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,610
Even an otter picks up a rock
when he wants a clam.

16
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:56,379
You don't think it's worthwhile to get
more women in science?

17
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,683
I think that's incredibly sexist of you.

18
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,517
I believe in a gender-blind society
like in Star Trek...

19
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:07,564
...where women and men of all races
and creeds work side by side as equals.

20
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,864
You mean where they were advanced
enough to invent an interstellar warp drive...

21
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:15,371
...but a black lady
still answered the space phone?

22
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:19,942
Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time
with Lieutenant Uhura.

23
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,913
Howard's disturbing recollections aside...

24
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:28,445
...I don't appreciate being forced
to do banal committee work.

25
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,282
I know. You're too smart for this.

26
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:35,053
Exactly. It's like asking the Human Torch
to heat up your frozen burrito.

27
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:40,059
Got it. All right, I'm thinking one way
to counter bias in the peer-review process...

28
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,396
...is for papers to be submitted
under gender-neutral names...

29
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,629
...like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith.

30
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,296
I suppose there is a history
of professional women...

31
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:51,069
...using their initials
so as not to be pre-judged.

32
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:55,578
Harry Potter's J.K. Rowling,
uh, Star Trek's D.C. Fontana.

33
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:58,376
Van Nuys pole-dancer, D.D. Melons.

34
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:04,816
All right. I think we've really helped
women today. Let's fire up the Xbox.

35
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:08,518
Don't make this a school project
where I'm the smart kid doing the work...

36
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,595
...while the slackers sit and watch.

37
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:13,288
We're not. You're the smart kid
doing all the work...

38
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,934
...while the even smarter kids
sit back and watch.

39
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,128
So you think I'm one of the smarter kids?

40
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,274
No, you're a tool I was using
to make my point.

41
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,096
Guys, our topic is
"Encouraging Women in Science."

42
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,265
Can you at least play a less sexist game?

43
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,812
How is it sexist?

44
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,509
My character wields a battle ax
as well as any man.

45
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:11,286
Not to mention she has mammary glands
that could nurse a family of 30.

46
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,828
And have enough milk left over
to open a Baskin-Robbins.

47
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,565
Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner...

48
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:24,669
...I hear glass ceilings shattering
all over town.

49
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,896
Sheldon, you're always saying
how much smarter you are than me.

50
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:33,239
Spend five seconds and come up with one
idea on how to get more women into science.

51
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,847
All your ideas address the issue
at a university level. By then it's too late.

52
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:42,715
You need to design a program that
targets girls at the middle-school level...

53
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,052
...and sets them on an academic track
towards the hard sciences.

54
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,561
That's actually good.
Why didn't I think of that?

55
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,159
Some people are otters,
some people are rocks.

56
00:03:56,402 --> 00:04:00,236
I wonder if there's a way
we could give the idea a trial run.

57
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:06,509
I could call my old middle school, see if
we can talk to some of the female students.

58
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,341
Great. Try to set up something
for us to go over there.

59
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,416
Hold on. While I'm comfortable
speaking about science...

60
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,919
...I'm not sure I know how to spark the
interest of school children. Better Google it.

61
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,919
What exactly are you looking up?

62
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:24,086
"How do I get 12-year-old girls excited?"

63
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,027
- No!
- No!

64
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,428
Thanks again for letting me crash
girl's night.

65
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,439
Are you kidding?
You brought fancy wine and made fondue.

66
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,770
I've slept with guys for less.

67
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,274
It's ajoke.

68
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,912
Based on real events.

69
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,989
Anyway, I was hoping
I could, uh, pick your brains a little.

70
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:55,889
I'm supposed to take Lucy out Friday
and I need a killer first date.

71
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,421
Evolutionary biology
says that women are attracted to a man...

72
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:04,059
...who is steady in the face of danger,
so I recommend an unsafe environment.

73
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,005
A seedy bar
on the wrong side of the tracks...

74
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,905
...a picnic near a lunatic asylum...

75
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,274
...a wine-tasting on skid row.

76
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,048
Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues,
we could start with something simpler.

77
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,318
Why don't you take her to Disneyland?

78
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,823
You go on Space Mountain,
you're in the dark, she's holding onto you.

79
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,087
That ride is shorter than you think...

80
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:34,256
...and they take a picture of you at the end,
so make sure you got your clothes on.

81
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,663
It's ajoke.

82
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,565
Based on real events.

83
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,639
Disneyland? I don't know.

84
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,802
With all the crowds
and the weird characters walking around...

85
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,947
...just reminds me too much of India.

86
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,277
I haven't been since I was a kid.
We should go one weekend.

87
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,681
Weekends are too crowded.

88
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,687
- So blow off work, go on a weekday.
- Hooky?

89
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,018
I've never played hooky in my life.

90
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:04,186
My mom said that's how girls end up
addicted to reefer and jazz music.

91
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,793
More like how girls end up
at a Best Western hotel...

92
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,664
...with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.

93
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,734
- Joke?
- I can laugh about it now.

94
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:23,239
What do you say? This Friday
we ditch work and go to Disneyland?

95
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,646
- I'm in.
- Me too.

96
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:29,254
Excuse me, I thought we were
trying to solve my problem.

97
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,821
Oh, yeah, right.

98
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,117
Wait, what was your problem again?

99
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:37,557
I'm a man who can't talk to women, trying
to figure out how to go on a romantic date...

100
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,032
...with a girl who suffers from social
anxiety, she can't be around other people.

101
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,628
Yeah, that's a toughie.

102
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,067
Let's think.

103
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,741
Are we doing just Disney
or California Adventure too?

104
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:05,886
It's nice of your old school to let us try out
our science talk on some female students.

105
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,084
They were actually pretty excited.
I'm their most famous alum.

106
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,561
If you don't count the serial killer
who ate all those prostitutes.

107
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,263
This must feel good for you, coming
back to your alma mater as an astronaut.

108
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,875
Yeah. Last time I was here
I was just a scrawny little nerd.

109
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,103
And now you're also an astronaut.

110
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,446
So many memories.
How many times in these hallways...

111
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:34,416
...was I tripped, punched and spit on? Heh.

112
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,919
Oh, look, here's my old locker.

113
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,417
I have a masters in engineering...

114
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:45,087
...I still can't figure out how Scott Kapinski
got me and my briefcase to fit in there.

115
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,965
- Hey.
- What?

116
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,730
Nothing.

117
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,741
Smart, we don't want any problems.

118
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,412
I can't believe I ditched work
for Disneyland.

119
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,914
What did you tell your boss?

120
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,177
Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages.

121
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,981
At 7 last night I called
about a problem at the lab...

122
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,989
...and casually mentioned
I was going out for seafood.

123
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,853
At 9:30, I called and told him
that one of my scallops tasted weird.

124
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,591
At 11:30, I called and said
I was throwing up like a fire hose.

125
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:27,269
At 12:45, I called and made nothing
but dry-heaving sounds.

126
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,768
And now I'm going to Disneyland!

127
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,967
Penny, what did you say?

128
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,444
I work at the Cheesecake Factory.
I said, "Bye."

129
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,108
So, what are we gonna do first?

130
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:44,655
I don't know about you, but I'm going to the
place that gives you a princess makeover.

131
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:45,848
Ooh, that sounds like fun.

132
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,654
You're kidding, right? We're not just
gonna get drunk and go on rides?

133
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,762
Come on, do it with us.

134
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,230
Ah, all right, whatever. How does it work?

135
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:59,064
Okay, so you pick your princess,
Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Cinderella.

136
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,467
They give you hair, makeup, the works.

137
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,668
I guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.

138
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,971
- I want to be Cinderella too.
- Yeah.

139
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,273
We can't all be Cinderella.

140
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:13,680
Then how do we decide?

141
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:18,017
Well, it's simple. This was my idea,
I'm driving, I'm Cinderella.

142
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,523
You bitches got a problem with that,
we can stop the car right now.

143
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,068
Excuse me.

144
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,370
I'm meeting a girl here.
It's kind of a first date.

145
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,939
In a library?

146
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:48,145
She and I are both a little awkward in social
situations so this seemed like a good idea.

147
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:52,052
Ah. People say I'm a little awkward too.

148
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,022
May I join you?

149
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,355
No, you can't join us.

150
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:02,194
Go climb back up whatever beanstalk
you came down from.

151
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,397
You can do better.

152
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,241
Oh, we're eating here?

153
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,252
We're having a texting date?

154
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,087
I love that.

155
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,665
As you're reading, it will help
to remember I have an adorable accent.

156
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:47,779
Okay, who's ready for some science?

157
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,351
Me too.

158
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,783
Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

159
00:10:55,955 --> 00:11:00,983
I'm here with my friends, Dr. Cooper,
and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz.

160
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,120
And we are going to show you girls
how cool ajob in science can be.

161
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,492
How cool, you ask?

162
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,659
Well, how about negative 273 degrees...

163
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,897
...because that's the temperature at which
entropy reaches its minimum value.

164
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:22,312
Did I just learn something new
and have fun doing it? What?

165
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,344
All right.

166
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:34,483
So now let's bring out theoretical physicist,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper!

167
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,059
Hello, female children.

168
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,202
Allow me to inspire you...

169
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,863
...with a story about
a great female scientist.

170
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,670
Polish-born, French-educated...

171
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:53,869
...Madame Curie.

172
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:56,737
Co-discoverer of radioactivity...

173
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:01,579
...she was a hero of science.
Until her hair fell out...

174
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,848
...her vomit and stool
became filled with blood...

175
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:09,222
...and she was poisoned to death
by her own discovery.

176
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,160
With a little hard work...

177
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,893
...I see no reason
why that can't happen to any of you.

178
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,499
Are we done? Can we go?

179
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,572
The thing to remember is
you can go to outer space too.

180
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,719
Heh. I mean, look at me.

181
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:38,255
I went to this very school.
Those desks you're sitting in?

182
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,858
I was once superglued to one of them.

183
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:43,752
Mm-hm.

184
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,362
Did you go to the moon?

185
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:49,467
No, but I did go
to the International Space Station.

186
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,000
Did you fly the rocket?

187
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:55,303
No, but I was in the rocket.

188
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,635
- I didn't actually...
- So you just flew around?

189
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,301
That's kind of like my uncle.
A flight attendant.

190
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,043
No, heh, I'm an American hero,
your uncle brings people nuts, okay?

191
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,813
All right, all right, all right.

192
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:15,119
Boy, we are learning a lot here, huh?
Thank you, Astronaut Howard.

193
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:19,157
Um, I am what's called
an experimental physicist.

194
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:24,234
Which is super fun because I get
to test theories and work with lasers.

195
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,670
- Yes?
- How did you decide to become a scientist?

196
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,171
Oh, excellent question.

197
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:32,833
Um, I suppose I've always been into science.

198
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:37,106
My mother and father are scientists,
so I was kind of led in that direction.

199
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,649
Pushed might be a better way to describe it.

200
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:44,420
To be honest with you guys, when
I was your age, I wanted to be a rap star.

201
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,053
Like Snoop Dogg, but with
a healthy respect for the police.

202
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,759
Yeah, no, sure, you laugh.

203
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,423
Just like my mother did.

204
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,894
After I confided, I was derided and chided

205
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,504
My moms and I collided

206
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,800
She said my dreams were misguided

207
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,082
That's just a little freestyle.

208
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:19,389
My dad's a gynecologist in India. So if
you're ever over there and need a checkup...

209
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:23,289
...as he likes to say, he's "at your cervix."

210
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,231
That's terrible. Your dad
should be sent to the pun-itentiary.

211
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,310
That's a fitting pun-ishment.

212
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,747
I still don't know what you do for a living.

213
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,848
Web design.

214
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,627
Anything I might've seen?

215
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,329
I don't know.
You ever look at porn websites?

216
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,076
No. Never. What is porn?

217
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,077
Sorry, auto-correct.

218
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,520
That was supposed to say "prom websites."

219
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,854
Ooh, fun. I love prom.

220
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:37,730
The romance, the gowns,
it's like a fairy tale come to life.

221
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,575
Sorry, auto-correct.

222
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,943
That was supposed to say "I like sports."

223
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:57,287
I never wanted to play the cello.

224
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:01,392
How do you meet girls playing the cello?

225
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,757
"Hey, wanna come over to my house
and hear me play an instrument...

226
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,194
...that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?"

227
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,628
Quick, pull the fire alarm,
let's get out of here.

228
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,265
Uh, hello again. Um...

229
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,466
Yeah, I don't know if women in general...

230
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,306
...have been actively discouraged
from pursuing the sciences...

231
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,712
...but it's clear you young women
here today have been.

232
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,181
While I was listening to my colleagues
waste your time...

233
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,920
...it occurred to me that it might be
much more meaningful...

234
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:41,533
...to hear about women in science
from actual women in science.

235
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,760
And, uh, I happen to know
two brilliant examples...

236
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:48,065
...who have agreed to speak to you
on the phone right now.

237
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,368
Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler?
Are you there?

238
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,033
We're here.

239
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:58,945
Thank you for taking time out of your busy
schedule to enlighten these young women.

240
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,745
It's our pleasure.

241
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,891
I'm Dr. Fowler, and I'm a neuroscientist.

242
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,190
And I'm Dr. Rostenkowski-Wolowitz,
and I'm a microbiologist.

243
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,697
The world of science needs more women,
but from a young age...

244
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,668
...we girls are encouraged to care
more about the way we look...

245
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,170
...than about the power of our minds.

246
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:29,337
That's true. Every one of you has
the capacity to be anything you want to be.

247
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,881
Unless you wanna be Cinderella.

248
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,653
Come at me, see what happens.

249
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,087
This was really fun.

250
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,930
My battery's dying, so I'm just gonna talk.

251
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,692
Thanks for today.

252
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,428
I've been trying to do more things
that scare me.

253
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,573
And coming here
was definitely one of them.

254
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,175
But it was also really nice.

255
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:01,574
So thanks, and, um, I'm gonna go.

256
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:12,421
Maybe I could do one more scary thing
before I go and give you a kiss goodbye?

257
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,620
You know, if that's okay.

258
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,394
Oh, okay.

259
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,121
Okay.

260
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,862
Panic attack! Maybe next time.

261
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,139
I'm counting that as foreplay.

262
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:41,819
Bernie, I'm home.

263
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,751
You have fun today?

264
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,989
Yes. And I have a surprise for you.

265
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,519
Please be Cinderella, please be Cinderella.

266
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,898
Well, hello, Prince Charming.

267
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,998
Milady.

268
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,177
Hey, how was your...? What?

269
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:20,624
I can explain. I played hooky with the girls
and we all went to Disneyland and go...

270
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,989
- What are you doing?
- Disneyland, go on, I'm listening.

271
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,498
Sheldon.

272
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,828
All Snow White needs
is one little kiss to wake up.

273
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,472
Heard you the first time.
