1
00:00:02,352 --> 00:00:06,254
Worst Renaissance fair ever.

2
00:00:07,323 --> 00:00:09,223
Please let it go, Sheldon.

3
00:00:09,392 --> 00:00:12,418
SHELDON:
It was rife with historical inaccuracies.

4
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,086
For example, the tavern girl
serving flagons of mead.

5
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,563
Now, her costume
was obviously Germanic...

6
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:21,932
...but in 1487, the Bavarian purity laws,
or <i>Reinheitsgebot...</i>

7
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,539
...severely limited the availability
of mead.

8
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,699
At best,
they would've had some spiced wine.

9
00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:29,436
LEONARD: You're nitpicking.
SHELDON: Oh, really?

10
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,136
Well, here's another nit for you.

11
00:00:31,314 --> 00:00:34,442
The flagons would not have been made
of polypropylene.

12
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,643
Renaissance fairs
aren't about historical accuracy.

13
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:40,415
They're about taking chubby girls
who work at Kinko's...

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,581
...and lacing them up
in corsets so tight...

15
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:45,694
...their bosom jumps out
and says, "Howdy."

16
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:49,124
Bosoms would not have said, "Howdy,"
in the 15th century.

17
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,563
If anything,
they would've said, "Huzzah."

18
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:53,726
I don't care what the bosoms say,
Sheldon.

19
00:00:53,903 --> 00:00:56,633
I just wanna be part of the conversation.

20
00:00:57,373 --> 00:00:58,533
Hi, guys.

21
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,835
Looks like you've been
to the Renaissance fair.

22
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,978
I'm hoping.

23
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,170
Renaissance fair?

24
00:01:04,347 --> 00:01:06,611
More of a medieval-slash-
Age of Enlightenment...

25
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:09,980
...slash-
any-excuse-to-wear-a-codpiece fair.

26
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,150
Okay, fine, whatever.
Um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.

27
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,450
- Hello.
ERIC: Hey.

28
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:20,860
So, yeah, good to see you.

29
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:23,556
Yeah. Yeah, it's good to see you too.

30
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,628
- We should probably go.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:26,803 --> 00:01:30,034
- Bye, guys.
- Like your hat.

32
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,608
Thanks, my mom made it.

33
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:38,911
Penny with a new guy. <i>Très</i> awkward.

34
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:42,083
It wasn't awkward.

35
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:46,116
It wasn't fun.
Besides, what's the big deal?

36
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:49,690
We dated, we stopped dating,
and now we're both moving on.

37
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,521
By "moving on," you mean
she's going out with other men...

38
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:56,825
...and you spend the afternoon
making 15th-century soap with Wolowitz?

39
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,927
That was not 15th-century soap.

40
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:02,162
My god, those people need to learn
you can't just put "ye olde" ...

41
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:05,273
...in front of anything you want
and expect to get away with it.

42
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:09,036
Can we please just go in?
My chain mail's stuck in my underwear.

43
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,447
You're wearing modern underwear?

44
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:15,209
Relatively modern.

45
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,444
What are you wearing?

46
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,579
I fashioned historically accurate
undergarments out of linen.

47
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:23,089
You went and bought linen?

48
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:26,456
Don't be silly.
I borrowed one of your pillowcases.

49
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:30,956
Borrowed?

50
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:57,326
You know,
I'm happy that Penny's moving on.

51
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:59,358
It gives me freedom to move on myself.

52
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:02,657
Are you saying
that you've been holding back?

53
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:06,057
Of course. Out of respect.

54
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:10,366
So how do you explain
the 10 years before Penny?

55
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,404
Who were you respecting then?

56
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:16,141
What? I've dated plenty of women.

57
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:20,544
There was, uh, Joyce Kim,
Leslie Winkle....

58
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:24,485
Notify the editors
of the Oxford English Dictionary:

59
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:27,680
The word "plenty"
has been redefined to mean "two."

60
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,950
What about that girl last year
at Comic-Con?

61
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,789
- It doesn't count.
- Why not?

62
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:37,694
What happens in costume at Comic-Con
stays at Comic-Con.

63
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:40,298
You're only saying that
because of what happened.

64
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,938
- What happened to you?
- Nothing happened to me.

65
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,568
It wasn't your fault, Raj.

66
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:47,972
He was dressed
as a green Orion slave girl.

67
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:52,047
How did we get on me?
We were mocking Leonard.

68
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:55,514
- Dude, you have totally not moved on.
- Yes, I have.

69
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:58,950
It's just a matter
of actually making a date with someone.

70
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:02,819
- Like who?
- Well, there's Joyce Kim.

71
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:06,393
But she defected back to North Korea...

72
00:04:06,863 --> 00:04:09,491
...so it's a little
geographically undesirable.

73
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,158
- What about Leslie Winkle?
- Oh, no.

74
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,770
- Why?
- Her research methodology is sloppy...

75
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:18,737
...she's unjustifiably arrogant
about loop quantum gravity...

76
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:22,139
...and to make matters worse,
she's often mean to me.

77
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:25,241
- I think she's smoking hot.
- I'd hit that.

78
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:30,141
You'd hit particulate soil
in a colloidal suspension.

79
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:32,481
Mud.

80
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,685
Look, I like Leslie,
but she's not interested in dating...

81
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,419
...as much as using men as tools
for stress release.

82
00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:42,086
Yeah? So? Be a tool.

83
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,433
Go get yourself
a little rebound stress release.

84
00:04:46,602 --> 00:04:50,470
It would only be rebound if he and Penny
had actually engaged in physical intimacy.

85
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,803
You mean like you
and Richard the slave girl?

86
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:58,603
I bought him dinner and we kissed once.
That was it.

87
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:01,742
And he told me his name was Kimberly.

88
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:09,690
You know how I know
we're not in the Matrix?

89
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:14,493
How?

90
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:18,229
If we were, the food would be better.

91
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:20,461
Hey, Leonard.

92
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:23,400
- Hey, Leslie.
- Hey, dummy.

93
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:27,834
Hello to you,
insufficiently intelligent person.

94
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:31,075
Ooh, rush me to the Burn Unit.

95
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:35,980
Do you have a second?
I need to ask you something.

96
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:38,552
- Yeah, sure.
- Well, if you'll excuse me...

97
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:42,179
...l'm going to go do work
that promises significant results...

98
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:46,454
...as opposed to what you do,
which does not.

99
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:49,397
Yeah, you heard me.

100
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,574
Wow.

101
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:06,515
So I heard your relationship with Penny
crashed to the ground...

102
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:09,515
...like blue ice
falling out of an airplane lavatory.

103
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:14,956
- Where'd you hear that?
- Actually, I read it. Wolowitz texted me.

104
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:19,188
"Like blue ice
falling out of an airplane lavatory," yep.

105
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:22,957
Yeah, I thought it was a pretty good one.
I gave him an "LOL."

106
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,599
Anyway, it got me thinking.

107
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,703
Now that you're unattached, maybe
we can revisit our previous attachment.

108
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:32,307
Are you suggesting another bout
of stress release?

109
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,999
No, I'm all done with casual sex.

110
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:37,044
I'm fully committed
to the traditional relationship paradigm.

111
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:38,237
Really? What changed?

112
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:40,739
There's just a time
in every woman's life...

113
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:43,181
...when she gets tired of waking up
on a futon...

114
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:45,616
...with a bunch of people
she doesn't know.

115
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:49,916
Yeah, I can see how that would--
A bunch of people?

116
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:52,561
Anyway, I just figure
it's time to slow things down...

117
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:55,788
...and who better to slow things down with
than you?

118
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,431
I'm flattered.

119
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:02,427
So how do you suggest we proceed?

120
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:06,063
Your place. We'll order Chinese.
You'll rent a movie, artsy but accessible.

121
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:08,233
Then light petting, no coitus.

122
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:12,804
- Sounds fun.
- I'll leave the details up to you.

123
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:16,110
I think it's better
if you assume the male role.

124
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:19,778
Thank you, that's very thoughtful.

125
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,918
Great.

126
00:07:22,091 --> 00:07:23,752
Call me.

127
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:33,159
Hey, great news.
My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.

128
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:34,530
LEONARD:
Oh.

129
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,233
- Terrific.
- You know what this means, don't you?

130
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:42,605
Break out the Red Bull.
It's time to rock "Mario" old school.

131
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:46,481
- I kind of have other plans tonight.
- But it's Friday.

132
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:50,346
Friday's always vintage-game night.
Look, Mom included the memory card.

133
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,957
We can pick up right where I left off
in 1999 when I had pernicious anemia.

134
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,119
The thing is, someone's coming over.

135
00:07:57,293 --> 00:08:00,592
Well, no problem. I have three controllers.
The more the merrier.

136
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:03,397
Sheldon, it's a date.
I have a date coming over.

137
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,760
Oh.

138
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,465
Well, you can't blame me
for not jumping to that conclusion.

139
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:12,967
Why? What's so unusual
about me having a date?

140
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:15,770
- Well, statistically speaking--
- All right, all right.

141
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:17,412
Nevertheless, I have one now...

142
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,981
...and I'd appreciate it if you would,
you know, make yourself scarce.

143
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,948
I am a published theoretical physicist
with two doctorates...

144
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,554
...and an IQ which can't be measured
by normal tests.

145
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:29,020
How much scarcer could I be?

146
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:33,393
You know what I mean.
Could you just give us a little privacy?

147
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:35,895
- You want me to leave the apartment?
- Yes.

148
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:38,465
You mean just go someplace else
and be...

149
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:40,158
...someplace else?

150
00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:42,126
- Yes.
- But why should I leave?

151
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:44,364
- This is my apartment too.
- I know it is.

152
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,304
If science ever discovers a second member
of your species...

153
00:08:47,476 --> 00:08:51,378
...and you two would like some privacy,

But why are you doing it on the stairs?

158

- Pastries such as bear claws?
- Yeah, sure.

Hang on a second.

309
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:25,049
Loop quantum gravity clearly offers
more testable predictions than string theory.

I'm listening. Amuse me.

311
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:31,421
Okay, well, for one thing,
we expect quantized space-time...

...to manifest as minute differences
in the speed of light for different colors.

Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.

Are you gonna let him talk to me
like that?

315
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:50,611
Okay, well,
there is a lot of merit to both theories.

316

No, there isn't. Only loop quantum gravity
calculates the entropy of black holes.

Sheldon, don't make that noise.
It's disrespectful.

00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,851
I should hope so.
It was a snort of derision.

You agree with me, right?

Loop quantum gravity
is the future of physics.

Sorry, Leslie,
I guess I prefer my space stringy, not loopy.

323
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:17,466
Well, I'm glad I found out the truth
about you before this went any further.

Truth? What truth?

Oh, it isn't? Really?

Tell me, Leonard,
how will we raise the children?

328
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:33,887
I guess we wait until they're old enough
and let them choose their own theory.

329
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:37,116
We can't let them choose, Leonard,
they're children.

Wait, where are you going?

I'm sorry.

I could've accepted our kids
being genetically unable to eat ice cream...

That's a temporal anomaly.
