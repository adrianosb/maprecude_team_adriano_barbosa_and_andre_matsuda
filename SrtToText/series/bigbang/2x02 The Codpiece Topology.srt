1
00:00:02,352 --> 00:00:06,254
Worst Renaissance fair ever.

2
00:00:07,323 --> 00:00:09,223
Please let it go, Sheldon.

3
00:00:09,392 --> 00:00:12,418
SHELDON:
It was rife with historical inaccuracies.

4
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,086
For example, the tavern girl
serving flagons of mead.

5
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,563
Now, her costume
was obviously Germanic...

6
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:21,932
...but in 1487, the Bavarian purity laws,
or <i>Reinheitsgebot...</i>

7
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,539
...severely limited the availability
of mead.

8
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,699
At best,
they would've had some spiced wine.

9
00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:29,436
LEONARD: You're nitpicking.
SHELDON: Oh, really?

10
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,136
Well, here's another nit for you.

11
00:00:31,314 --> 00:00:34,442
The flagons would not have been made
of polypropylene.

12
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,643
Renaissance fairs
aren't about historical accuracy.

13
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:40,415
They're about taking chubby girls
who work at Kinko's...

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,581
...and lacing them up
in corsets so tight...

15
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:45,694
...their bosom jumps out
and says, "Howdy."

16
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:49,124
Bosoms would not have said, "Howdy,"
in the 15th century.

17
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,563
If anything,
they would've said, "Huzzah."

18
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:53,726
I don't care what the bosoms say,
Sheldon.

19
00:00:53,903 --> 00:00:56,633
I just wanna be part of the conversation.

20
00:00:57,373 --> 00:00:58,533
Hi, guys.

21
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,835
Looks like you've been
to the Renaissance fair.

22
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,978
I'm hoping.

23
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,170
Renaissance fair?

24
00:01:04,347 --> 00:01:06,611
More of a medieval-slash-
Age of Enlightenment...

25
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:09,980
...slash-
any-excuse-to-wear-a-codpiece fair.

26
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,150
Okay, fine, whatever.
Um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.

27
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,450
- Hello.
ERIC: Hey.

28
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:20,860
So, yeah, good to see you.

29
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:23,556
Yeah. Yeah, it's good to see you too.

30
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,628
- We should probably go.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:26,803 --> 00:01:30,034
- Bye, guys.
- Like your hat.

32
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,608
Thanks, my mom made it.

33
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:38,911
Penny with a new guy. <i>Tr√®s</i> awkward.

34
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:42,083
It wasn't awkward.

35
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:46,116
It wasn't fun.
Besides, what's the big deal?

36
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:49,690
We dated, we stopped dating,
and now we're both moving on.

37
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,521
By "moving on," you mean
she's going out with other men...

38
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:56,825
...and you spend the afternoon
making 15th-century soap with Wolowitz?

39
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,927
That was not 15th-century soap.

40
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:02,162
My god, those people need to learn
you can't just put "ye olde" ...

41
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:05,273
...in front of anything you want
and expect to get away with it.

42
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:09,036
Can we please just go in?
My chain mail's stuck in my underwear.

43
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,447
You're wearing modern underwear?

44
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:15,209
Relatively modern.

45
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,444
What are you wearing?

46
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,579
I fashioned historically accurate
undergarments out of linen.

47
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:23,089
You went and bought linen?

48
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:26,456
Don't be silly.
I borrowed one of your pillowcases.

49
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:30,956
Borrowed?

50
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:57,326
You know,
I'm happy that Penny's moving on.

51
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:59,358
It gives me freedom to move on myself.

52
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:02,657
Are you saying
that you've been holding back?

53
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:06,057
Of course. Out of respect.

54
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:10,366
So how do you explain
the 10 years before Penny?

55
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,404
Who were you respecting then?

56
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:16,141
What? I've dated plenty of women.

57
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:20,544
There was, uh, Joyce Kim,
Leslie Winkle....

58
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:24,485
Notify the editors
of the Oxford English Dictionary:

59
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:27,680
The word "plenty"
has been redefined to mean "two."

60
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,950
What about that girl last year
at Comic-Con?

61
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,789
- It doesn't count.
- Why not?

62
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:37,694
What happens in costume at Comic-Con
stays at Comic-Con.

63
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:40,298
You're only saying that
because of what happened.

64
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,938
- What happened to you?
- Nothing happened to me.

65
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,568
It wasn't your fault, Raj.

66
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:47,972
He was dressed
as a green Orion slave girl.

67
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:52,047
How did we get on me?
We were mocking Leonard.

68
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:55,514
- Dude, you have totally not moved on.
- Yes, I have.

69
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:58,950
It's just a matter
of actually making a date with someone.

70
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:02,819
- Like who?
- Well, there's Joyce Kim.

71
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:06,393
But she defected back to North Korea...

72
00:04:06,863 --> 00:04:09,491
...so it's a little
geographically undesirable.

73
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,158
- What about Leslie Winkle?
- Oh, no.

74
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,770
- Why?
- Her research methodology is sloppy...

75
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:18,737
...she's unjustifiably arrogant
about loop quantum gravity...

76
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:22,139
...and to make matters worse,
she's often mean to me.

77
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:25,241
- I think she's smoking hot.
- I'd hit that.

78
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:30,141
You'd hit particulate soil
in a colloidal suspension.

79
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:32,481
Mud.

80
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,685
Look, I like Leslie,
but she's not interested in dating...

81
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,419
...as much as using men as tools
for stress release.

82
00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:42,086
Yeah? So? Be a tool.

83
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,433
Go get yourself
a little rebound stress release.

84
00:04:46,602 --> 00:04:50,470
It would only be rebound if he and Penny
had actually engaged in physical intimacy.

85
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,803
You mean like you
and Richard the slave girl?

86
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:58,603
I bought him dinner and we kissed once.
That was it.

87
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:01,742
And he told me his name was Kimberly.

88
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:09,690
You know how I know
we're not in the Matrix?

89
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:14,493
How?

90
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:18,229
If we were, the food would be better.

91
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:20,461
Hey, Leonard.

92
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:23,400
- Hey, Leslie.
- Hey, dummy.

93
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:27,834
Hello to you,
insufficiently intelligent person.

94
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:31,075
Ooh, rush me to the Burn Unit.

95
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:35,980
Do you have a second?
I need to ask you something.

96
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:38,552
- Yeah, sure.
- Well, if you'll excuse me...

97
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:42,179
...l'm going to go do work
that promises significant results...

98
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:46,454
...as opposed to what you do,
which does not.

99
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:49,397
Yeah, you heard me.

100
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,574
Wow.

101
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:06,515
So I heard your relationship with Penny
crashed to the ground...

102
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:09,515
...like blue ice
falling out of an airplane lavatory.

103
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:14,956
- Where'd you hear that?
- Actually, I read it. Wolowitz texted me.

104
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:19,188
"Like blue ice
falling out of an airplane lavatory," yep.

105
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:22,957
Yeah, I thought it was a pretty good one.
I gave him an "LOL."

106
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,599
Anyway, it got me thinking.

107
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,703
Now that you're unattached, maybe
we can revisit our previous attachment.

108
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:32,307
Are you suggesting another bout
of stress release?

109
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,999
No, I'm all done with casual sex.

110
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:37,044
I'm fully committed
to the traditional relationship paradigm.

111
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:38,237
Really? What changed?

112
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:40,739
There's just a time
in every woman's life...

113
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:43,181
...when she gets tired of waking up
on a futon...

114
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:45,616
...with a bunch of people
she doesn't know.

115
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:49,916
Yeah, I can see how that would--
A bunch of people?

116
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:52,561
Anyway, I just figure
it's time to slow things down...

117
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:55,788
...and who better to slow things down with
than you?

118
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,431
I'm flattered.

119
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:02,427
So how do you suggest we proceed?

120
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:06,063
Your place. We'll order Chinese.
You'll rent a movie, artsy but accessible.

121
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:08,233
Then light petting, no coitus.

122
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:12,804
- Sounds fun.
- I'll leave the details up to you.

123
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:16,110
I think it's better
if you assume the male role.

124
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:19,778
Thank you, that's very thoughtful.

125
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,918
Great.

126
00:07:22,091 --> 00:07:23,752
Call me.

127
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:33,159
Hey, great news.
My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.

128
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:34,530
LEONARD:
Oh.

129
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,233
- Terrific.
- You know what this means, don't you?

130
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:42,605
Break out the Red Bull.
It's time to rock "Mario" old school.

131
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:46,481
- I kind of have other plans tonight.
- But it's Friday.

132
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:50,346
Friday's always vintage-game night.
Look, Mom included the memory card.

133
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,957
We can pick up right where I left off
in 1999 when I had pernicious anemia.

134
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,119
The thing is, someone's coming over.

135
00:07:57,293 --> 00:08:00,592
Well, no problem. I have three controllers.
The more the merrier.

136
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:03,397
Sheldon, it's a date.
I have a date coming over.

137
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,760
Oh.

138
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,465
Well, you can't blame me
for not jumping to that conclusion.

139
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:12,967
Why? What's so unusual
about me having a date?

140
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:15,770
- Well, statistically speaking--
- All right, all right.

141
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:17,412
Nevertheless, I have one now...

142
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,981
...and I'd appreciate it if you would,
you know, make yourself scarce.

143
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,948
I am a published theoretical physicist
with two doctorates...

144
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,554
...and an IQ which can't be measured
by normal tests.

145
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:29,020
How much scarcer could I be?

146
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:33,393
You know what I mean.
Could you just give us a little privacy?

147
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:35,895
- You want me to leave the apartment?
- Yes.

148
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:38,465
You mean just go someplace else
and be...

149
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:40,158
...someplace else?

150
00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:42,126
- Yes.
- But why should I leave?

151
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:44,364
- This is my apartment too.
- I know it is.

152
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,304
If science ever discovers a second member
of your species...

153
00:08:47,476 --> 00:08:51,378
...and you two would like some privacy,

But why are you doing it on the stairs?

158

I am a modern-day Napoleon

- I don't know. You know, cookies, pastries--

- Pastries such as bear claws?
- Yeah, sure.

- No, Chang's.

Okay, let me put it this way.
If you're Leonard's friend...

Loop quantum gravity clearly offers
more testable predictions than string theory.

I'm listening. Amuse me.

Okay, well, for one thing,
we expect quantized space-time...

in the speed of light for different colors.

Okay, well,
there is a lot of merit to both theories.

No, there isn't. Only loop quantum gravity

Sheldon, don't make that noise.
It's disrespectful.

I should hope so.
It was a snort of derision.

Loop quantum gravity

Sorry, Leslie,
I guess I prefer my space stringy, not loopy.

Well, I'm glad I found out the truth
about you before this went any further.

Truth? What truth?

Tell me, Leonard,
how will we raise the children?

328
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:33,887
I guess we wait until they're old enough
and let them choose their own theory.

We can't let them choose, Leonard,
