1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,506
- Hey.
- Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,426
Yeah. Got 8 pounds of salmon
that's about to go bad.

3
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:12,678
- Do you know how to cook it?
- Not really.

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,557
Damn it.
Should've liberated the iffy chicken.

5
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:20,769
So, what are you
and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?

6
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,397
Star Wars on Blu-ray.

7
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,733
Haven't you seen that movie
a thousand times?

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,568
Not on Blu-ray.

9
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,279
Only twice on Blu-ray.

10
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,197
Oh, Leonard. Ugh.

11
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:36,535
I know. It's high-resolution sadness.

12
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,288
Well, I was gonna take myself out
to a movie tonight.

13
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,581
You wanna go?

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,208
- Really? Do we do that?
- What do you mean?

15
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,795
You know, we haven't spent time alone
together since we broke up.

16
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,965
It's not a date, Leonard.
It's a man and a woman hanging out...

17
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,843
...not having sex
at the end of the night.

18
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,929
Sounds like most of my dates.

19
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:01,060
Oh, dear Lord.
Get away from me, you monster.

20
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,312
What is that about?

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,232
He's smart and crazy enough.
He may have actually created a monster.

22
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,234
Shoo, shoo.

23
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,569
Be gone.

24
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,029
What the hell is going on?

25
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,032
There's a bird outside the window
and he won't go away.

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,326
That is the hell that is going on.

27
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:21,246
We have no worms or seeds here.
Shoo, shoo.

28
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,334
Really? On top of everything else,
you're afraid of birds?

29
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:29,880
It's called ornithophobia, and someday it
will be recognized as a true disability...

30
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:34,635
...and the landlord will be required by
law to put a giant net over the building.

31
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,180
Which is unfortunate,
because I have a fear of nets.

32
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,766
So movies, yes or no?

33
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,518
- Oh, movies, yes.
- Mm.

34
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:45,854
Great. I'll see you later.
And remember, he's more afraid of you...

35
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,773
- ...than you are of him.
- That doesn't help.

36
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,024
Oh.

37
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,568
I was talking to the bird.

38
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:58,242
Go away, bird. Go away, bird.
Go away, bird.

39
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,869
Sheldon, just ignore him.

40
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:04,581
Good idea.
Attention is what birds want.

41
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh.

42
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,128
Much better. All right.

43
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,421
Now I'll just get along with my life.

44
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,261
Make a pot of tea, Leonard,
it's gonna be a long night.

45
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,098
Bird still there?

46
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,894
- Quick, what does a hawk sound like?
- I don't know, uh...

47
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,230
Scree, scree.

48
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,817
Please, that's a seagull.
If you're not going to help, don't help.

49
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,653
Sorry. Hey, do you think
I'm over-dressed?

50
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:20,532
Uh, it depends on the activity.
For a prostate exam, yes.

51
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,204
If you're playing Vegas,
I'd add sequins.

52
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,414
I'm going to the movies with Penny.

53
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,416
I don't want her to think
I think it's a date.

54
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,959
- Do you think it's a date?
- No.

55
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,545
But she might think I think it's a date,
even though I don't.

56
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,006
Or you think she thinks
you think it's a date.

57
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,092
- Are we over-thinking this?
- Not at all.

58
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:44,848
- You're right. I'm fine. I'm wearing this.
- Really? A blazer? All right.

59
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,649
Yes, hello.
Uh, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

60
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,693
I'm at 2311
North Los Robles Avenue.

61
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,571
I'd like to report
a dangerous wild animal.

62
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,365
A blue jay.

63
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:07,371
I'm sorry, this is Animal Control.
I don't understand the laughter.

64
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,289
No, the bird is not in my home.

65
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:13,335
If he was in my home,
I obviously would've called 911.

66
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,672
I have no doubt that there are things
that you're frightened of.

67
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,841
Uh, being stuck in a dead-end
public service job.

68
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,677
Or your wife stepping out on you...

69
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,638
...because you're stuck
in a dead-end public service job.

70
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,932
Or spiders.

71
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,644
Don't you think
I tried making cat noises?

72
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,442
Too casual?

73
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,237
For an audience with the Queen, yes.

74
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,490
For an evening of passing a bottle
of fortified wine around a trash can...

75
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,367
...you look great.

76
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,593
What am I thinking? Whiskers.

77
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,434
Oh, hey, if we hurry we can make
the Jennifer Aniston movie.

78
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,685
Oh, yeah, sure.

79
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,770
Yeah, uh,
there's also an amazing documentary...

80
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:17,107
...about building a dam on a river
in South America.

81
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,278
Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie
has Jennifer Aniston.

82
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,947
And she's not building a dam.

83
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,493
- Can't argue with that. I'll get the tickets.
- Okay.

84
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,497
Actually, you know what?

85
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,167
I think it's about time
I pick a movie we see.

86
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,502
Wha...? You picked plenty of movies.

87
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,340
No, you always picked
and it was always the same.

88
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,300
An hour and a half of beach houses...

89
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:47,971
...until the woman turns around
and realizes love was here all along.

90
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,975
Come on, that is a great movie.
And it starts in ten minutes.

91
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,895
But I hate those movies.

92
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,355
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

93
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:00,609
The only reason I went is because you
wanted to see them and I wanted sex.

94
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,029
To this day I can't see
a Sandra Bullock poster...

95
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,115
...without getting both bored
and aroused.

96
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,535
So while we were going out,
how often would you pretend...

97
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,662
...to like things
just to have sex with me?

98
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,831
All the time.

99
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,876
You're kidding.

100
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,378
Does this sound familiar?

101
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,130
"I'd love to go
shoe shopping with you."

102
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,384
"Hiking, it's great."

103
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,011
"it's 2 a.m., of course,
I wanna go to Koreatown...

104
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,390
...and sing karaoke with your friends.
Who wouldn't?"

105
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,768
Okay. We were going out.
You were gonna get sex anyway.

106
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:39,815
Really? You would've slept with me after
a three hour documentary on dams?

107
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,485
No. No woman would.

108
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,072
See, now, that's the great thing.
We're out as friends.

109
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,241
This is not a date. Sex is off the table.

110
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,743
So let's go learn
why hydroelectric power...

111
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,330
...might not be the environmental
bargain you think it is.

112
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,584
Sorry, spoiler alert.

113
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,131
- Ugh. All right. Fine.
- Thanks.

114
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,174
Uh, tickets are 11 bucks.

115
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,097
Not a date.

116
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,894
Come on, Sheldon. Star Wars.

117
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,855
I'm pushing play. I mean it.

118
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,525
Yeah, if we don't start soon,
George Lucas is gonna change it again.

119
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,656
This would go a lot faster
if you put your diploma to work...

120
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,742
...and help me set up this high-frequency
tone generator.

121
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,037
I have a master's degree from MIT.

122
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:39,791
Yeah, but you've got a can-do attitude,
and that's what's important.

123
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,587
I really don't get your problem
with birds.

124
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:48,175
The question you should be asking is,
what is their problem with me?

125
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:52,429
My first memory, a hummingbird
dive-bombing my stroller...

126
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,640
...to get at the apple juice
in my sippy cup.

127
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,726
Hummingbirds are pretty.

128
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,438
Hummingbirds are the vampires
of the flower world.

129
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,942
Still my first choice
for an ankle tattoo.

130
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,072
Or a dolphin. I go back and forth.

131
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,576
Age 7, a blood-thirsty chicken
chases me up a tree.

132
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:19,831
Age 12, a magpie tries to steal
the retainer out of my mouth.

133
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:24,085
Age 16, a parrot in a pet store
calls me fat ass.

134
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,880
Need I go on?

135
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,883
Yes, please.
This is way better than the movie, heh.

136
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,011
All right, Sheldon.
Your bird death ray is ready.

137
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,474
It's not a death ray. It's just a little
ultrasonic blast to scare him off.

138
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,519
Trust me, if I had a death ray,
I wouldn't be living here.

139
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:44,064
I'd be in my lair enjoying the money
the people of Earth gave me...

140
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,899
...for not using my death ray.

141
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,819
All right. And in three, two, one.

142
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,373
That is one tough birdie.

143
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,752
Come on, you enjoyed the movie.

144
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,673
I saw you tearing up when the village
flooded and everyone had to relocate.

145
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,592
No, I was thinking how come
they get to leave and I can't.

146
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,888
I'm gonna get some fries.
You want anything?

147
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,557
- Uh, no, thanks.
- Are you sure?

148
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,643
Because you always say no,
and then you eat half my fries.

149
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,145
I just eat the little crispy ones
you don't like.

150
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:28,858
No, I love them. I save them for the end,
but they're gone because you ate them.

151
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,528
And why did I let you eat them?

152
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,321
- To get sex.
- Exactly.

153
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,741
But this is not a date.

154
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,119
So I ask again.
Would you like anything?

155
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,998
- All right. I'd like an order of fries.
- Great. That'll be 5 dollars.

156
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,335
I am having the best time.

157
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,213
I'm so glad you suggested we do this.

158
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,217
- Oh. Sorry.
- No problem.

159
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,846
- What you writing there?
- Uh, a screenplay.

160
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,099
It's about a guy whose roommate is
having sex and tells him to go...

161
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,518
...and work on his screenplay.

162
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,898
"I Hope Alex Gets Crabs: The Movie."

163
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,942
- It's a working title.
- Oh. Ha, ha.

164
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,277
- I'm Kevin.
- Oh, Penny.

165
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,570
Nice to meet you.

166
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:17,032
- I'll let you get back to your date.
- Oh, no, no. This isn't a date. No.

167
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,993
Right?

168
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,704
Uh, right.

169
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,165
So have you written anything
I might have seen?

170
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,876
That depends.
How much time do you spend on Yelp?

171
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,724
This is ridiculous.

172
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,018
I'm a grown man from Texas.

173
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:49,689
This isn't a terrifying bird
like a swan or a goose.

174
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,734
It's just a blue jay.

175
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,533
That's a pretty big blue jay.

176
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,263
One, two, three.

177
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,474
Go. Shoo.

178
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,522
Bird in the apartment.
Bird in the apartment.

179
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,857
No!

180
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,740
So it is an amazing documentary.

181
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,618
They need electricity from the dam...

182
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,497
...but at the same time,
they wanna preserve the environment.

183
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,084
You're kidding me.

184
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,465
- Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?
- Oh, sure. Just one sec?

185
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,259
No problem.

186
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,845
- What's up?
- I know what you're doing.

187
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,055
- What?
- You're going to talk to that guy...

188
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,475
- ...because I said we weren't on a date.
- I'm talking to him because he's cute.

189
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,395
- Uh, come on. He's not that cute.
- Yes, he is...

190
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,898
...with his dorky T-shirt
and his little hipster glasses.

191
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,157
I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.

192
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:26,494
Yes, but when you're tall and have great
cheekbones, you're doing it ironically.

193
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,916
- So, what if I start talking to a girl?
- You should.

194
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,753
- Yeah, heh. I'm serious, I'll do it.
- Good, go.

195
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,547
There's some girls right over there.

196
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,053
- What are you waiting for?
- They're in a group. I'm scared.

197
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,850
Sheldon,
what do you expect us to do?

198
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,188
You're biologists.
Biology is the study of living things.

199
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,523
That's a living thing. Get cracking.

200
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:01,070
I specialize in microorganisms
and Amy studies brains.

201
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:04,532
Yeah, neither of us minored
in bird shooing.

202
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,285
Oh, come, now.
Your undergraduate work...

203
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,705
...must've included
a varmints and critters class.

204
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,125
Come back in, Sheldon.
He's not gonna hurt you.

205
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,670
He looks friendly.
I think he might be someone's pet.

206
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,756
What? No, Bernadette.
Don't be a hero.

207
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:25,094
- Aw, he's a sweetie.
- Yes. He's very sweet.

208
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:30,058
Now slowly and carefully
flush him down the toilet.

209
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:37,023
Sheldon, the only way to get past
this fear is to interact with it.

210
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,901
Just like you did with the mailman.

211
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:44,781
Every year, tens of people
around the world are killed by birds.

212
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,451
I'm not going to be another statistic.

213
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,080
Look how sweet he is.
Come over and say hi.

214
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,920
Come on, you can do it.

215
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,171
Don't be scared.

216
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,761
Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby.

217
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,812
I did it, heh.

218
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,274
I actually did it.

219
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,110
Okay, now flush him.

220
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,323
So, Leonard, what do you do for fun?

221
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,409
Um, let's see.

222
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,494
Hiking.

223
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,622
Karaoke in Koreatown.

224
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,877
Any Jennifer Anniston movie.

225
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,422
- Hey, sorry I ditched you.
- No, it's fine. Ditch away.

226
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,424
Oh, no.
We were gonna hang out. Let's hang out.

227
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,802
- It's cool. Go back to Kevin.
- No, he had to leave.

228
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,178
Interesting.

229
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,806
So now that he's gone,
you wanna hang out with me.

230
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,391
- This must be Penny.
- Yep.

231
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,560
I totally get it.

232
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,357
- Uh, I'm sorry. Get what?
- Don't worry about it.

233
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,484
There's guys over there.
Go talk to them.

234
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:07,572
- No, no. I wanna know what you told her.
- That's kind of between me and...

235
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,532
- Laura.
- Laura.

236
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,410
Oh, okay, I see.
So while he was telling you things...

237
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,372
...did he mention he owns not one,
but two Star Trek uniforms?

238
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,374
- Really?
- Yeah. Wears them.

239
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,710
Not just for Halloween.

240
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,172
Hey, pal.

241
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,718
You didn't see me telling Kevin
that you thought cold wars...

242
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,387
...were only fought in winter.

243
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,598
Okay, then I'll return the favor...

244
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,059
- ...and I won't tell...
- Laura.

245
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:40,855
...Laura that half the dirty movies
you own are animated.

246
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,987
When you were telling Kevin
about your acting career...

247
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,823
...did you mention your long-running
role as waitress...

248
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,410
...in a local production
of The Cheesecake Factory?

249
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,789
Did you tell her
about your lucky asthma inhaler?

250
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,334
Oh, yeah? Spell asthma.

251
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,005
A-S...

252
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,966
Take me home.

253
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,759
Maybe I'm not done hanging out...

254
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,223
You're right, it's getting late.

255
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,689
It's remarkable.

256
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:26,901
All that time spent in fear. For what?

257
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,237
He's magnificent.

258
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:35,034
Ah! Oh, dear. I just realized
I haven't offered you a beverage.

259
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,752
Aw, it's just like my grandma
with her parrot.

260
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,339
And after she lost her marbles,
with her remote control.

261
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:54,887
My phone's on the desk over there.
Take a picture of us together.

262
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,766
Make it good enough to go on a mug,
a mouse pad and a calendar.

263
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,150
If you were a dove,
I'd call you Lovey Dovey.

264
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:11,404
Oh, who am I kidding? This isn't a moment
for strict adherence to the literal.

265
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,323
You're just my little Lovey Dovey,
aren't you?

266
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:19,579
I guess you gotta have hollow bones
to get some sugar around here.

267
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,500
I still think
he looks like someone's pet.

268
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,210
Maybe we should put up posters.

269
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,630
Yes, it should have a big picture of him
and the words:

270
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:33,426
"Is this your bird? Not anymore."

271
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,472
We're gonna have
so much fun together.

272
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,016
You can carry messages
to all my enemies.

273
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,267
And, um...

274
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:45,646
I can tie a string to your leg
and fly you like a kite.

275
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,399
If you're keeping him,
I've got a cage you can borrow.

276
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,528
One of the test monkeys slipped
on a banana peel and broke his neck.

277
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:56,199
It was both tragic and hysterical.

278
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:02,622
Nonsense. No, Lovey Dovey
doesn't sleep in a cage.

279
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:06,125
No, Lovey Dovey sleeps
in his very own nest...

280
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,837
...which I'm going to get off
the window sill and put in my room.

281
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,507
Isn't that right, L.D.?

282
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,804
No.

283
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,430
Where are you going?

284
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:23,017
Come back, Lovey Dovey.
This is your home now.

285
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:27,271
I already ordered 20 pounds
of bird feed off of Amazon.

286
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,443
- He's gone.
- I'm sorry, Sheldon.

287
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,570
How could he do this to me?

288
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:39,158
Get back here you stupid bird
so I can love you!

289
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,573
Okay, so we went out, saw a movie...

290
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,285
...met some nice people, said horrible
things about each other in public.

291
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,288
All in all, a pretty magical night.

292
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,666
Okay, I'm not innocent in all this,
but you basically called me stupid...

293
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,711
...you asthmatic dumb-ass.

294
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:36,549
I know, uh, I crossed the line.
And I'm sorry.

295
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:40,219
And no, no, uh, I really mean it.
It's not like when we were going out...

296
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,639
...I'd just apologize for everything
so we could end up in bed.

297
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:49,520
This is a 100 percent
"sex is off the table" I'm sorry.

298
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,940
All right. Thank you. I'm sorry too.

299
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,819
Just to be clear,
sex is off the table, right?

300
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,614
Way off.

301
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,701
Maybe we're not ready to hang out
as friends.

302
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,745
I don't know. Up until the last part...

303
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:09,207
...I was enjoying take-charge Leonard
with a little backbone.

304
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,586
Picking the movie,
knowing what he wants, a little cocky.

305
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,171
- Really?
- Yeah.

306
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:19,467
Well, then, I'm putting sex
back on the table.

307
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,764
What do you think about that?

308
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,557
Hmm, maybe I like it.

309
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,770
If that's what you like, I can be that guy.
I'll be anything you want me to be.

310
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:32,855
Good night, Leonard.

311
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,988
I am such an asthmatic dumb-ass.

312
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,450
I had a weird night.

313
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,577
Mine was great.

314
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,580
I'm going to be a mommy.
