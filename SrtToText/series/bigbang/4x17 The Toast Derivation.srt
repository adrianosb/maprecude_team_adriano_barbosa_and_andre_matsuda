00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:44,624
I have guests coming.

155
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,826
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave now.

156
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:53,800
- I am leaving.
- Don't make this harder than it is.

157
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,344
- Goodbye, Sheldon.
- And goodbye to you, sir.

158
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:06,078
He'll be back.

159
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,815
LEONARD:
Of course I'll be back, I live here!

160
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:26,867
Well, it would appear
LeVar Burton won't be joining us.

161
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:29,476
So, um, let's get started.

162
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:33,342
Uh, I thought we'd begin by going
around the room, introducing ourselves...

163
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:35,847
...and saying a little bit
about why we're here.

164
00:09:36,018 --> 00:09:37,781
Okay, ahem, uh, I'm Sheldon.

165
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:41,286
Uh, for readers of the New England
Journal of High Energy Physics...

166
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,549
...I need no introduction.

167
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:47,856
If you're not familiar with that,
there's a free copy in your goody bag.

168
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,862
Stuart?

169
00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:56,064
Um, ahem, hi, I'm Stuart.

170
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:57,933
I run a comic book store...

171
00:09:58,107 --> 00:10:01,770
...which, for financial reasons,
I'm currently living in.

172
00:10:02,244 --> 00:10:07,307
And I guess what I'm hoping for most
out of tonight is a hot shower.

173
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,877
That's very nice, Stuart. Zack?

174
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:13,551
I'm Zack and I'm, uh...

175
00:10:14,456 --> 00:10:16,651
Uh...

176
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,589
Could you come back to me?

177
00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:23,163
Of course. Barry?

178
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,800
I'm Barry Kripke and I'm here
because you told me there was a raffle.

179
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:30,595
When is the raffle?

180
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:32,899
Patience, patience, Barry, the waffle...
Ahem.

181
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:35,168
The raffle...

182
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:40,247
...is the grand finale to an evening-long
festival of fun and folly.

183
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:43,543
- One more question...
- Yes, you must be present to win.

184
00:10:44,553 --> 00:10:47,613
Okay, I'm ready. I'm Zack and I'm, uh...

185
00:10:48,457 --> 00:10:50,322
Oh, crap, why is this so hard?

186
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:56,321
PENNY: Oh, hey.
- Hi.

187
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:59,490
- Yo, P-Dawg.
- Ha, ha. What's up?

188
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:02,136
We're here to kidnap you
for a girls' night out.

189
00:11:02,304 --> 00:11:06,104
Parenthetical, the term "kidnap"
is being used playfully.

190
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:07,836
I kind of figured that.

191
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,002
Good, now put this pillowcase
over your head.

192
00:11:12,514 --> 00:11:13,947
No.

193
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:17,449
She used to be much more fun
until Leonard punched her in the heart.

194
00:11:19,455 --> 00:11:22,982
We thought you might wanna go out,
have a good time, maybe go dancing.

195
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:25,660
Oh, gee, thanks,
but I'm not really in the mood.

196
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:27,692
You do understand it will distract you...

197

...from obsessing
over the rich variety of sweet loving...

198

200
00:11:35,604 --> 00:11:37,902
Okay, look, if I agree to go out
with you guys...

201
00:11:38,107 --> 00:11:40,667
...will you stop pestering me
about Leonard and Priya?

202
00:11:40,876 --> 00:11:42,241
- Yes.
- Sure.

203
00:11:42,478 --> 00:11:44,969
All right, I'll go change.
Come on in.

204
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:48,913
If you'd have let me bring chloroform, we
wouldn't have had all this jibber jabber.

205
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:56,051
Anyway, after snowboarding,
I go to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi.

206
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:59,388
There's no one around,
so naturally I'm free-balling it.

207
00:12:00,863 --> 00:12:03,195
Next thing I know,
this beautiful chick shows up.

208
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:05,697
Drunk out of her skull,
wants to get in with me.

209
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:10,270
Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?

210
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:14,408
- Really, that's your question?
- What's the difference?

211
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:18,579
Jacuzzi is a commercial brand,
hot tub is the generic term...

212
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:23,411
...i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs
but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.

213
00:12:24,153 --> 00:12:28,419
Is that like all thumbs are fingers
but not all fingers are thumbs?

214
00:12:29,258 --> 00:12:31,385
Surprisingly, yes.

215
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,155
Nice.

216
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:36,559
Now, what exactly are toes?

217
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,693
Can you please
get back to the drunk girl?

218
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:43,360
I'd like something to think about
in the shower.

219
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,462
Oh, yeah, right.

220
00:12:45,674 --> 00:12:48,040
She takes off all of her clothes,
climbs in the hot tub.

221
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,441
- And the first thing I notice...
- The water level rose.

222
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,907
- No.
- Well, of course it did.

223
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,984
It's said that Archimedes,
the ancient Greek mathematician...

224
00:12:58,187 --> 00:13:01,816
...discovered the principle
of displacement while taking a bath.

225
00:13:03,058 --> 00:13:06,255
Terrific. Go ahead, Zack.
Naked drunk girl, free-balling, continue.

226
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:07,895
Wait, forgive me...

227
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:10,497
...but I think you'll find
my story is more interesting.

228
00:13:10,732 --> 00:13:13,064
Does yours have wet breasts in it?

229
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,429
Better, it has a gold crown.

230
00:13:16,638 --> 00:13:19,334
You see, the king wondered
how much gold was in it...

231
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:22,705
...and charged Archimedes
with coming up with the solution.

232
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:26,473
The crown was irregularly shaped, there
was no way to determine its volume.

233
00:13:26,715 --> 00:13:29,309
But while bathing,
Archimedes realized...

234
00:13:29,485 --> 00:13:34,445
...he could immerse the crown
and measure the amount the water rose.

235
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,494
So long story short, I nailed her.

236
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,795
When he finished,
he shouted, "Eureka."

237

No, I always shout, "Holy moly."

238
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:52,868
Don't know why, just do.

239
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,637
All right, that concludes the getting-
to-know-you portion of the evening.

and blow the roof off this place?

You know, if being on your own
is new to you, I'd be happy to share...

305
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:24,210
...some tension-relieving techniques
for ladies I've perfected over the years.

306
00:17:25,153 --> 00:17:28,645
For example,
do you have an electric toothbrush?

307
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:33,092
PENNY: Uh, no.
- You should get one.

308
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:36,386
What's that?

309
00:17:36,565 --> 00:17:40,023
It appears to be something preserved
between two pieces of acrylic.

310
00:17:40,235 --> 00:17:43,762
PENNY: Oh, it's a snowflake from the north
pole. Leonard gave it to me last year.

311
00:17:43,972 --> 00:17:46,202
Oh, God, that is so romantic.

312
00:17:46,408 --> 00:17:48,273
Yeah, it was.

313
00:17:48,844 --> 00:17:50,835
Leonard's really one of a kind.

314
00:17:51,046 --> 00:17:54,709
Saying that while holding a snowflake
is a little heavy-handed, don't you think?

315
00:17:55,383 --> 00:17:56,975
Let me see that.

316
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,381
Oh, screw it.
I can deal with a little self-loathing.

317
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:05,048
Let's go find me a heinie to bite.

318
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:07,622
Outstanding. And if we fail...

319
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:12,199
...we always can stop at CVS
and pick you out a nice toothbrush.

320
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:15,363
I call mine Gerard.

321
00:18:17,506 --> 00:18:19,701
That's kind of creepy.

Anybody do
"Walking on Sunshine" yet?

- No.
- Dibs.

329
00:18:51,973 --> 00:18:56,103
I'm sorry, Sheldon bought a loom
and learned how to weave?

330
00:18:56,311 --> 00:19:00,042
He actually got pretty good.
He made us all matching serapes.

331
00:19:00,248 --> 00:19:03,115
I still wear mine
when there's a nip in the air.

332
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:07,282
Now, was this before or after
he adopted the 25 cats?

333
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:10,151
Long before the cats.
I think it was around the time...

334
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:14,091
...he tried to declare our apartment
a sovereign nation.

335

I still have some of the currency.

I think it's like Beetlejuice.
We said his name too many times.

- Come on in.
- Thank you.

Hey, I thought you were
with your new buddies.

00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:39,312
I had to leave.
They were having fun wrong.

- Come here, Sheldon, sit with me.
- Thank you.

Would you like some homemade chili?

345
00:19:46,628 --> 00:19:47,822
Are there beans in it?

346
00:19:48,663 --> 00:19:50,631
- Yes.
- Oh, then it's not chili.

347
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,824
Real chili has no beans in it.

348
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:57,370
But you're from a foreign land,
so your ignorance is forgiven.

- Yes, please.

a little short-tempered.

I'd like to propose a toast.

To friends, no matter how quirky.

ALL:
Cheers.

Priya, do you know
why this is called a toast?

355
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,822
Actually, I do.

356
00:20:19,995 --> 00:20:24,056
I believe the Romans used to put
spiced toast in their punch bowls.

She's also a bit of a know-it-all.
