00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:06,775
My new book, The Hidden Reality,
takes on a grand question:

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,942
Is our universe the only universe?

3
00:00:10,286 --> 00:00:13,346
You see, there's a growing belief
among scientists like me...

4
00:00:13,523 --> 00:00:16,822
...that ours may only be one
among many universes...

5
00:00:16,993 --> 00:00:18,984
...populating a gigantic cosmos.

6
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,861
In The Hidden Reality,
I explore possibility...

7
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:25,057
...without presuming any knowledge
of mathematics or physics...

8
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:26,725
...on the part of the reader.

9
00:00:26,936 --> 00:00:29,131
Hysterical.

10
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,702
I'm glad you talked me into this.

11
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:35,709
We work so hard, sometimes it's nice
to goof off and do something silly.

12
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:36,971
Agreed.

13
00:00:37,147 --> 00:00:40,480
Wait till you hear how he dumbs down
Werner Heisenberg for the crowd.

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,517
You may actually believe
you're in a comedy club.

15
00:00:43,686 --> 00:00:46,553
You can think about Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle...

16
00:00:46,723 --> 00:00:50,420
...much like the special order menu
that you find in Chinese restaurants...

17
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:54,029
...where you have dishes in column A
and other dishes in column B...

18
00:00:54,197 --> 00:00:58,361
...and if you order the dish in column A,
you can't order the dish in column B.

19
00:00:58,535 --> 00:01:01,003
That's sort of like
the uncertainly principle.

20
00:01:01,838 --> 00:01:03,703
Ba-rum-bum.

21
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:09,168
Say, I heard an interesting tidbit
about Howard and Bernadette.

22
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:11,376
Really, Amy? Gossip?

23
00:01:11,548 --> 00:01:13,038
I'm disappointed in you.

24
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:17,277
Now, now. Evolutionary biologist
Robin Dunbar has identified gossip...

25
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:19,785
...as an aid to social bonding
in large groups.

26
00:01:20,223 --> 00:01:23,624
Forgive my language, but poppycock.

27
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:26,626
What if he's right?
And by not participating in gossip...

28
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:30,254
...society breaks down into feral bands
of tattooed motorcycle riders...

29
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:33,129
...fighting to the death
over a few cans of tuna fish?

30
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:36,363
Fine. In the parlance
of the urban music scene:

31
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:39,007
"What's the 411"?

32
00:01:39,943 --> 00:01:42,605
Bernadette is thinking
about breaking up with Howard.

33
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:45,945
I believe our nation's
tuna cans are safe.

34
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:48,709
Excuse me. Ahem. Dr. Greene, question?

35
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:50,579
Yes?

36
00:01:50,753 --> 00:01:54,086
You've dedicated your life's work
to educating the general populace...

37
00:01:54,257 --> 00:01:56,589
...about complex scientific ideas.

38
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,817
Yes, in part.

39
00:01:58,027 --> 00:02:01,326
Have you ever considered
trying to do something useful?

40
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:06,326
Perhaps reading to the elderly?

41
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:08,094
Excuse me?

42
00:02:08,271 --> 00:02:11,399
Yeah, but not your books.
Something they might enjoy.

- Shooting a target?

50
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:18,998
- With what?
- An arrow.

51
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:22,667
Really? I didn't see you draw one
from your quiver.

an actual athletic experience.

55

We have to do our part too.

That was uncalled for,
but I'll play along. Ow.

57
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,506
I had an unusual experience
with Amy last night.

58
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:55,542
Really? How could you tell?

59
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,213
She was attempting
to engage me in gossip.

60
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,049
- You don't say.
- Yes.

61
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:06,712
I think prolonged exposure to Penny has
turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.

62
00:04:07,357 --> 00:04:08,585
So, what's the gossip?

63
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:10,726
Oh, please, I was just pointing it out.

64
00:04:10,893 --> 00:04:13,157
I have no desire
to engage in the activity.

Oh, that's too bad.
I wonder what happened.

69
00:04:26,242 --> 00:04:28,039
Hard to say. I can only speculate...

70
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:31,442
...based on data I collected
watching my parents' marriage implode.

156
00:09:05,454 --> 00:09:07,718
It doesn't matter.
Howard has a girlfriend.

157
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,049
- For now.
- What?

158
00:09:09,225 --> 00:09:10,351
I'll tell you later.

159
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:12,460
Is something going on
with Bernadette?

160
00:09:12,628 --> 00:09:15,222
- Who's Bernadette?
- Doesn't sound Jewish.

161
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:19,333
You can't tell by that.
Winona Ryder is Jewish.

162
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:22,332
DR. KOOTHRAPPALl:
Okay, we're getting off the subject.

163
00:09:22,505 --> 00:09:25,565
I want you to try harder
to make your sister feel welcome.

164
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:27,003
Thank you, Daddy.

165
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:31,044
Don't worry. Everything I have,
I share with her. Including my friend Le...

166
00:09:32,014 --> 00:09:33,743
Good night, Mummy.
Good night, Daddy.

167
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,442
Oh, my God, I think you broke my toe.

168
00:09:39,155 --> 00:09:42,522
- You should have kept your mouth shut.
- Fair enough.

169
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:44,990
Now, what's up with clarinet...
Bernadette?

170
00:09:50,232 --> 00:09:52,530
I've been thinking
about Dr. Greene's efforts...

171
00:09:52,702 --> 00:09:55,170
...to make science palatable
for the masses.

172
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:57,431
Oh, yeah? What about it?

173
00:09:57,606 --> 00:10:00,268
That's all.
I've just been thinking about it.

174
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:05,003
Now I'm thinking
about fractal equations.

175
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:10,351
Now I'm thinking about the origin
of the phrase "train of thought."

176
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:13,477
Now I'm thinking about trains.

177
00:10:15,224 --> 00:10:17,283
Are you listening to this guy?

178
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,122
Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry.
I was somewhere else.

179
00:10:20,296 --> 00:10:22,491
Lucky bastard.

180
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:27,292
Now, I'm thinking about Jell-O.

181
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:31,764
- So, what's up?
- It's a Bernadette thing.

182
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:36,109
Oh, no. I hope everything's okay.

183
00:10:38,814 --> 00:10:40,907
Whatever it is, we're here for you.

184
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,983
You can tell us anything.

185
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:45,450
Yeah. Good or devastating.

186
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:50,251
- I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
- Marry you?

187
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:51,586
- What?
- Yeah.

188
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:54,958
I just need to figure out the right time
to pop the question.

189
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:58,066
- Oh, I'd wait.
- No rush, no rush.

190
00:10:58,234 --> 00:10:59,792
[CELL PHONE CHIMING]

191
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:02,233
Oh, great.
It's my cousin David about the ring.

192
00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:04,305
Hey, David, what did you find?

193
00:11:04,473 --> 00:11:07,101
Sure, half a carat's fine.

194
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:10,074
Her freakishly small hands
make anything look big.

195
00:11:11,414 --> 00:11:14,247
It's one of the reasons I love her.

196
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:19,352
Man, he's gonna be blindsided.

197
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:23,082
I know. It'll be awful.

198
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,991
Why are you smiling?

199
00:11:27,696 --> 00:11:29,288
Yeah, Raj, why?

200
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:33,964
Uh... A smile means something different
in my country.

201
00:11:34,136 --> 00:11:38,095
You know, tears of joy,
smile of sadness.

202
00:11:38,274 --> 00:11:40,105
India's a goofy place.

203
00:11:41,877 --> 00:11:44,641
Oh, I'm back to trains.

204
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:47,713
Woo-hoo!

205
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:55,181
Did I tell you our lab got a grant
to study addiction?

206
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:57,222
- No.
- Fascinating work.

207
00:11:57,393 --> 00:12:00,885
I recently trained a capuchin monkey
to smoke cigarettes.

208
00:12:01,464 --> 00:12:02,829
Have you learned anything?

209
00:12:02,998 --> 00:12:07,367
Yes. He looks much cooler
than the non-smoking monkeys.

210
00:12:07,837 --> 00:12:09,202
It's not much of a contest.

211
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:12,204
The other monkeys just sit around
and masturbate.

212
00:12:16,145 --> 00:12:21,014
If you don't mind, I'd like
to stop listening to you and start talking.

213
00:12:21,684 --> 00:12:22,776
By all means.

214
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:27,315
Howard has announced his intention
to propose marriage to Bernadette.

215
00:12:27,823 --> 00:12:28,881
I don't understand.

216
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:31,993
The original piece of gossip
indicated an impending breakup.

217
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:35,653
I know. The group consensus is
that his proposal will be met...

218
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:39,358
...with a humiliating,
soul-crushing rejection.

219
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:42,026
Everyone was set atwitter.

220
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:45,730
Although, oddly, no one tweeted.

221
00:12:47,343 --> 00:12:51,211
It's not surprising that the story has
captured the attention of our friends.

222
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:56,181
- Are you familiar with meme theory?
- I'm familiar with everything, but go on.

223
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:00,250
Meme theory suggests that items
of gossip are like living things...

224
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:03,050
...that seek to reproduce
using humans as their host.

225
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:06,292
I'm no stranger
to memetic epidemiology.

226
00:13:06,462 --> 00:13:08,089
At Johnson Elementary School...

227
00:13:08,264 --> 00:13:12,894
...the phrase "Shelly Cooper's
a smelly pooper" spread like wildfire.

228
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,031
I should think so.

229
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:18,139
That's gold.

230
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,475
Your meme hypothesis
does intrigue me.

231
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:26,740
How might we examine this
more closely?

232
00:13:27,483 --> 00:13:30,611
Do you have any ethical qualms
regarding human experimentation?

233
00:13:30,986 --> 00:13:35,582
It's one of the few forms of interaction
with people that I don't find repellent.

234
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:39,083
We need to fabricate
a tantalizing piece of gossip.

235
00:13:39,495 --> 00:13:42,760
And a second non-tantalizing piece
to use as a control.

236
00:13:42,932 --> 00:13:45,127
Track its progress
through our social group...

237
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:47,565
...interpret results
through academic prisms...

238
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:51,866
...of memetic theory, algebraic gossip
and epidemiology.

239
00:13:52,408 --> 00:13:56,936
Look at you, getting me to engage
in the social sciences.

240
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:01,980
You're a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler.

241
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,252
Oh, hey, Amy. What's up?

242
00:14:09,425 --> 00:14:11,188
Sheldon and I engaged in intercourse.

243
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:15,523
In other news, I'm thinking of starting an
herb garden. Mum's the word. Gotta go.

244
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,666
Oh, hey, Raj,
what are you doing here?

245
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:27,508
I just felt like drinking alone
because I'm deep and dark.

246
00:14:28,344 --> 00:14:31,177
Uh-huh. So Howard's not here?

247
00:14:31,347 --> 00:14:33,679
No. One of those times
when it's just you and me.

248
00:14:33,849 --> 00:14:37,046
Like when we went to the movies
and waited outside the bathroom...

249
00:14:37,219 --> 00:14:40,017
...while Howard threw up
Red Vines and cherry Coke.

250
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,883
- Do you remember that?
- Yeah.

251
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:46,926
Me too. Good times.

252
00:14:47,997 --> 00:14:49,862
Hey, 16 wants to order appetizers.

253
00:14:50,032 --> 00:14:53,229
- Oh, thanks.
- This was nice.

254
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:59,066
What are you doing?
Howard's your best friend.

255
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:01,801
That is his girlfriend.
Be ashamed of yourself.

256
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:06,243
I was when I came in, but it's amazing
what liquor does to guilt.

257
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:10,507
What you might not know is Bernadette
is planning on breaking up with Howard.

258
00:15:10,686 --> 00:15:13,018
- I know. How do you know?
- My sister told me.

259
00:15:13,188 --> 00:15:15,656
Oh, that gossipy bitch.

260
00:15:17,526 --> 00:15:18,993
- No offense.
- None taken.

261
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:21,356
You should hear
how she talks about you.

262
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:26,095
Just because Howard and Bernadette
are having problems...

263
00:15:26,268 --> 00:15:28,532
...does not mean
you should be sniffing around.

264
00:15:28,704 --> 00:15:31,502
What can I do?
I can't stop thinking about her.

265
00:15:31,674 --> 00:15:34,108
All right, try thinking about this.

266
00:15:34,276 --> 00:15:35,903
Sheldon and Amy had sex.

267
00:15:36,745 --> 00:15:39,839
Shut your ass.

268
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,748
Yeah, it's true. Amy told me.

269
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,683
How did that even happen?

270
00:15:46,855 --> 00:15:50,382
Did they know that's what they
were doing when they were doing it?

271
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:52,786
I guess they just figured it out
at some point.

272
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:57,864
Wow. I can't believe old smelly pooper
finally got laid.

273
00:16:01,537 --> 00:16:02,902
- Hey.
- Hey.

274
00:16:03,072 --> 00:16:05,097
Hope you're hungry.

275
00:16:05,274 --> 00:16:08,766
Interesting. A friendly sentiment
in this country...

276
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:12,038
...cruel taunt in the Sudan.

277
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:15,710
It's a lesson in context.

278
00:16:16,118 --> 00:16:17,779
Will Amy be joining us for dinner?

279
00:16:17,953 --> 00:16:19,284
Yes, I believe so.

280
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,786
Good, good.

281
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:23,789
Everything okay between you two?

282
00:16:29,465 --> 00:16:31,296
Yes.

283
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,932
Why do you ask?

284
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,139
No reason. I was just talking to Raj...

285
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:43,142
...and he mentioned
what a lovely glow she has these days.

286
00:16:43,812 --> 00:16:46,474
Did he mean
as if she'd been out in the sun...

287
00:16:46,648 --> 00:16:50,948
...tending an herb garden
without wearing a hat or sunblock?

288
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:54,319
No.

289
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,981
That's not what he meant.

290
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,487
Well, we may never know.

291
00:17:00,662 --> 00:17:05,429
As my mother would say,
the Asians are an inscrutable folk.

292
00:17:08,003 --> 00:17:10,198
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

293
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:13,933
Yeah, you do. You dog, you.

294
00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:21,543
Did you get that?

295
00:17:21,717 --> 00:17:26,017
Every word. Our false gossip meme
appears to have reached node lambda.

296
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:28,053
This is moving faster
than we thought.

297
00:17:28,223 --> 00:17:30,817
Agreed. Rate of gossip transmission
is proportional...

298
00:17:30,993 --> 00:17:33,484
...to the number of nodes squared.

299
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:36,789
I must say, Amy, pretending
to have intercourse with you...

300
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:40,128
...is giving me a great deal
of satisfaction.

301
00:17:41,303 --> 00:17:43,703
Slow down, Sheldon.
I'm not quite there yet.

302
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:49,567
- Pass the soy sauce.
HOWARD: Sure.

303
00:17:49,745 --> 00:17:52,646
Bernadette just asked
about my sexual encounter with you.

304
00:17:52,815 --> 00:17:55,750
The meme
has reached full penetration.

305
00:17:58,253 --> 00:17:59,743
Pun intended?

306
00:18:00,756 --> 00:18:02,917
No. Happy accident.

307
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,554
This is remarkable.

308
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:08,593
Took less than 24 hours.

309
00:18:08,764 --> 00:18:12,131
I should let you know that she asked
for details about our dalliance.

310
00:18:12,668 --> 00:18:13,760
Interesting.

311
00:18:13,936 --> 00:18:19,169
So it went beyond the mere fact
of coitus to a blow-by-blow, as it were.

312
00:18:21,043 --> 00:18:22,738
Pun intended?

313
00:18:22,911 --> 00:18:25,141
I'm sorry. What pun?

314
00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:29,183
Not important.

315
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:32,511
I described your lovemaking
as aloof, but effective.

316
00:18:34,189 --> 00:18:36,384
I wish you hadn't done that.

317
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,858
That's going to make me
a chick magnet, and I'm so busy as it is.

318
00:18:42,297 --> 00:18:46,131
Hey, everybody, I got something
I wanna ask Bernadette...

319
00:18:46,301 --> 00:18:50,067
...and I can't think of a better time
than when I'm with all my friends.

320
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,470
Oh, hold on, Howard.
There's lots of better times.

321
00:18:54,943 --> 00:18:56,274
Please, the man is talking.

322
00:18:56,445 --> 00:19:00,313
Let him get it out,
and let the chips fall where they may.

323
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:03,246
Thank you.

324
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,612
Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski...

325
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:09,689
Oh, God. What's happening?

326
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:14,922
I know things haven't been perfect
with us, and we've had our problems...

327
00:19:15,097 --> 00:19:17,258
...but I just have to tell you...

328
00:19:17,432 --> 00:19:19,764
...from the moment l...
- Howard, stop right here.

329
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,596
This is it.

330
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:25,402
Yes.

331
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,732
Yes, what?

332
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:29,801
Yes, I will marry you.

333
00:19:29,978 --> 00:19:31,240
- You will?
- You will?

334
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:32,471
I will.

335
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:36,613
- I will.
- Oh, I love you so much.

336
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:37,911
Oh, I love you too.

337
00:19:38,086 --> 00:19:39,519
Congratulations.

338
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,120
Oh, it's so exciting.

339

340
00:19:45,928 --> 00:19:47,623
I wonder what changed her mind.

341
00:19:48,263 --> 00:19:52,825
Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess
renewed her faith in love.

342
00:19:54,136 --> 00:19:56,730
As good an explanation as any.

343
00:19:57,806 --> 00:19:59,433
That's great.

344
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:06,347
Oh, hey, Amy.
Bernadette just texted me.

345
00:20:06,515 --> 00:20:07,914
Howard proposed?

346
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,916
Yes. Just stopped by
to let you know I'm getting orthotics.

347
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:14,681
Also, I'm carrying Sheldon's baby.
Mum's the word.

348
00:20:20,062 --> 00:20:22,496
You're pregnant?!

349
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:28,096
Wow, is there anything on there
about orthotics?
