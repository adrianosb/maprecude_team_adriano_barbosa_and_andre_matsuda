1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,005
- Previously:
- Who says that in the middle of sex?

2
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,257
I don't know.
It was the heat of the moment.

3
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:11,176
No, the heat of the moment is,
"Oh, yeah, just like that."

4
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:14,138
Not, "Will you marry me?"

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,518
NASA really wants my telescope up
on the Space Station...

6
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,563
...so they're putting me
on an earlier launch.

7
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,858
- When?
- A week from Friday.

8
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,652
What? But we're getting married
that Sunday.

9
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:33,824
You're right. I can't go to space.
I have to get married.

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,828
No one can say that's not a good reason.
I'll call them back.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,707
- Have the wedding when you get back.
- Your dad's gonna be furious.

12
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,502
There's no way he's gonna let us
postpone this wedding. Well, we tried.

13
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:50,382
I'll talk to him.
He won't say no to his little girl.

14
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:54,428
No, I... l should talk to him,
you know, man-to-man.

15
00:00:54,929 --> 00:01:00,059
All right, look, I'm gonna level with you.
I'm terrified about going into space.

16
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:03,103
You know,
what if I don't make it back?

17
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,023
It's gonna be okay, son.

18
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,400
You really think so?

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,402
Of course.

20
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,821
A pretty girl like Bernadette?

21
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,282
She'll find a new guy.

22
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,503
- Hey, Mike?
- Yeah?

23
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:30,339
I changed my mind.
I don't wanna do this.

24
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,219
- Good one.
- Yeah, I'm a funny guy.

25
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,721
I also have a hysterical bit
planned for later...

26
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,724
...where I pretend to cry
through the whole launch.

27
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,156
- Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?
- Two-eighty-nine...

28
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,784
...right between
the Game Show Network at 288...

29
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:02,746
...and the East Coast feed
of the Disney Channel on 290.

30
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,416
I love his eidetic memory. It's so sexy.

31
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,753
Sheldon, what are the ingredients
in Pringles?

32
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,882
Dried potatoes, vegetable oil,
corn flour, wheat starch...

33
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,469
...maltodextrin, salt,
and my favorite ingredient of all...

34
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,596
...uniformity.

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,766
The uterus quivers, does it not?

36
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,601
There's Howard's rocket...

37
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,937
- ...live from Kazakhstan.
- Oh, I'm so nervous.

38
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,647
I don't think I can watch.

39
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:32,901
You're nervous? I've been stress-eating
for four days. Look at me.

40
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,654
I'm wearing my fat pants.

41
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:36,905
Remarkable.

42
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:41,493
In just under a half hour,
200 metric tons of fuel will ignite...

43
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:45,914
...in a controlled explosion
right beneath Howard's keister.

44
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,585
And all from a country whose entire
contribution to the global economy...

45
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,713
...has been "Tetris"
and mail-order brides.

46
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,550
Give me those damn Pringles.

47
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,017
Okay, we're in the final countdown.

48
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:08,103
- How you doing over there?
- Good, good.

49
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,480
Quick question.
I missed it in the briefing.

50
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,357
How much urine do these suits hold?

51
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,555
Hey, Froot Loops,
wanna hit your fan switch?

52
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,182
Check.

53
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:50,395
He calls you Froot Loops
because of your very gay haircut?

54
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,443
No, it's because I live with my mom
and she makes me Froot Loops.

55
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,281
Go with gay story.
People are more accepting of that.

56
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,287
Actually, Froot Loops
just got married to a girl.

57
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,081
Congratulations.

58
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,000
Thanks.
We decided to do it before the launch.

59
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,461
You and Mrs. Loops
have a big wedding?

60
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:17,756
Not exactly.

61
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,717
Listen, if you don't mind,
I'm not really up for chatting.

62
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:26,265
I'm just gonna sit here quietly
and let my life flash before my eyes.

63
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,229
That went really quick.
Let me try it again.

64
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,194
Close your eyes. Put out your hand.
I got you something special.

65
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,489
Come on, Howard,
I'm not falling for that again.

66
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,910
No, here.

67
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,208
Oh, Howie, a little star.

68
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,584
It's beautiful.

69
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,961
Put it on me.

70
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,588
Okay, but I'm gonna have
to get it back from you...

71
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,009
...so I can take it
to the international Space Station.

72
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,511
That way, when I come home...

73
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,432
...you will have a star
that was actually in space.

74
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,435
Oh, my God.

75
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,646
Take that, every guy
who's ever bought you anything.

76
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,318
This is the most amazing gift
I've ever gotten.

77
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,656
Really? If you like it that much,
close your eyes and put out your hand.

78
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,038
I'm going to the
supermarket to buy snacks for your trip!

79
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:35,792
Do you want me to get those
little boxes of Froot Loops you like?

80
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:41,256
No. When I eat Froot Loops,
the other astronauts make fun of me!

81
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,304
I don't wanna wait
until you're back to get married.

82
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,680
What?

83
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,641
I wanna be married to you
before you get in that rocket.

84
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,311
But I'm leaving in two days.

85
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,314
What about Apple Jacks?!

86
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,859
I don't need to take cereal!

87
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,111
What kind of breakfast do you think...

88
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,238
...they're gonna give you in Russia?!

89
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:10,118
They invented blintzes! I'll be fine!

90
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,621
They invented
the light bulb in New Jersey!

91
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,583
It doesn't mean they hand them out
to you when you go!

92
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,545
We'll have a little ceremony
with just our friends.

93
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:24,007
We'll still have the big reception
with everyone when you get back.

94
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,718
Wow, okay, let's get married.

95
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,016
You know what?!

96
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:38,563
I'll buy you All-Bran in case
you get stopped up in outer space!

97
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,986
We decided to go down to city hall
this afternoon, get married...

98
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,697
...and then have the reception
when Howard gets back.

99
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,116
- That's so great.
- Cool.

100
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,411
We know it's short notice,
but we'd love you all to come with us.

101
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,123
No, no, no,
this is not the wedding I wanted.

102
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,626
I wanna wear
my maid-of-honor dress...

103
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,254
...walk down the aisle
with a hundred eyes on me...

104
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,632
...while a string quartet plays
"The way You Look Tonight."

105
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,592
That wasn't our processional music.

106
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,636
Well, it was gonna be mine.

107
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,265
Thank you for the invitation,
but I have to decline...

108
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,059
...because it doesn't sound like
something I'll enjoy.

109
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,979
Come on, it'll be fun.

110
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,982
That's what you said about
the Green Lantern movie.

111
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,361
You were 114 minutes of wrong.

112
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,406
So, what do you say, Amy?

113
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:35,078
- Can I wear my maid-of-honor dress?
- Seriously? Wear that thing to city hall?

114
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,873
It's all I have left.
You gonna take that from me too?

115
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,508
- Amy, you look great.
- I know.

116
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,346
Where'd you get a beer?

117
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,558
From that happy young couple over there
with all the tattoos.

118
00:07:56,767 --> 00:08:00,729
Beautiful story. They're in rival
drug gangs and they're getting married.

119
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,815
Shh. No one can know.

120
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,319
Look at all these people in love.

121
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,321
Kind of gets you thinking, doesn't it?

122
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,448
It does, indeed.

123
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,326
Leonard, is it awkward
being here with Penny...

124
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,995
...given that you recently
proposed to her?

125
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,083
- You proposed?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

126
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,336
Where'd he pop the question?
What'd you say?

127
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,464
- She said no. Can we drop it?
- Itwasn't a real proposal.

128
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,717
- Why wasn't it a real proposal?
- He asked her during coitus.

129
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,806
Did you get down on one knee
or were you already there? Ha, ha!

130
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,727
Don't talk like that
on your wedding day.

131
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,314
Sorry, Ma... Bernadette.
Ma... Bern... You're my Bernadette.

132
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,361
- Good move telling Sheldon.
- Can't propose, can't talk to my friends.

133
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,738
Is there anything else
I'm not allowed to do?

134
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,574
All right, that's enough.
Today is not about you two.

135
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:59,579
Today is about Howard
and Bernadette and me.

136
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,707
Folks, can I have your attention?

137
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,293
It's 5:00.
We're gonna take three more couples.

138
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,546
The rest have to come back
on Monday.

139
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,131
- No.
- I got this.

140
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,885
Excuse me, but is there any way
you can squeeze us in?

141
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:20,392
See, I'm an astronaut
and I'm leaving for Russia on Sunday...

142
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:24,354
...so I can take a Soyuz rocket
to the international Space Station.

143
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,523
Yeah, me too. I'll see you there.

144
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,279
I can't believe
we're not gonna get married.

145
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,616
I'm gonna go see if the couple at the
front of the line needs a maid of honor.

146
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,376
So I tell my wife,
"Get a dog, don't get a dog.

147
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,255
I'm not walking it, I'm not feeding it,
I'm not picking up after it."

148
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,467
You know you're gonna wind up
walking it.

149
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,469
I know.

150
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:02,559
Um, shouldn't you guys be talking
about space stuff instead of dogs?

151
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,937
Dimitri, Froot Loops
would be more comfortable...

152
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,315
...if we talked about space stuff.

153
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,444
Okay. I'm going into space.

154
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:16,114
And when I come back,
I have to pick up a poodle crap.

155
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,619
Is that better?

156
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,204
Thanks.

157
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,085
You know, we could always drive
to Vegas and get married.

158
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,920
No, isn't that kind of tacky?

159
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,381
I know tons of people
who got married in Vegas.

160
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,009
- Are any of them still married?
- Yeah.

161
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,345
I mean, not to the same people,
but...

162
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,182
There's gotta be someplace special
we could do it.

163
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,686
Leonard, where did you envision
marrying Penny?

164
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,523
Will you shut up?

165
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,486
I know how to make it special.

166
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:58,114
I told you, we are not re-creating
the wedding from The Sound of Music.

167
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,909
Yes, you made that brutally
clear to me.

168
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,703
What I was going to suggest is...

169
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,498
...if you're willing
to wait until Sunday morning...

170
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,542
...the Google satellite
will be over Pasadena.

171
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,420
You can have your wedding
photographed from space.

172
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,339
- Whoa.
- That's so cool.

173
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,216
- Way to go, Raj.
- I keep telling you.

174
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,636
If I wasn't an astrophysicist,
I would've been a party planner.

175
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,640
It was always a coin-flip.

176
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,685
Okay, so we know
we're gonna do it Sunday morning.

177
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:30,480
Now we need to find a good place
for the satellite to see us.

178
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,148
How about our roof?

179
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,567
- Oh, I like that.
- That's great.

180
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,819
Oh, my gosh.

181
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,656
I can't believe my maid-of-honor dress
is gonna be on Google Earth.

182
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,701
So we have the where
and the when...

183
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,329
...but we still need to figure out
who's gonna do the ceremony.

184
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,040
Anyone can go online
and get ordained as a minister.

185
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,710
I know a piercing parlor
where they'll marry you...

186
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,088
...and stick a wedding ring
through any body part you want.

187
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,384
Right, well, who's it gonna be?

188
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:04,097
I'll do it, provided I can perform
the ceremony in Klingon.

189
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,599
No.

190
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,310
What do you see in her?

191
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,193
Leaking? What's leaking?

192
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,696
Fuel. Shh.

193
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,623
There's fuel leaking
and we're still gonna go?

194
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,335
Don't lose your Froot Loops,
Froot Loops.

195
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,504
This happens a lot.

196
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,965
Nine times out of 10, no problem.

197
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,636
- What happens on the 10th time?
- Problem.

198
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,935
Hey, guys, before I forget,
I got you a little groomsmen present.

199
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,437
- Thanks.
- You didn't have to.

200
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:57,275
Fantastic Four Annual Number 3
from 1965 in mint condition.

201
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,945
The one where Mr. Fantastic
and the invisible Girl get married.

202
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,405
Oh, wow.

203
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,532
Oh, dear.

204
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,952
- I was afraid of this.
- What?

205
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,623
While a thoughtful gift,
this comic book in this condition...

206
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,126
- ...is worth at least $100.
- Yeah, so?

207
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:19,172
I bought you and Bernadette
a gravy boat worth $88.

208
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:24,135
Which places me in your debt,
and I can't be in your debt...

209
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,514
...because someday,
you might ask me to help you move...

210
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,519
...or to kill a man.

211
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,480
I doubt he'll ask you to kill a man.

212
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,316
Well, what if it's his only way out?
I can't risk it.

213
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,861
Here is $12.

214
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,991
Now we're even. Wait, wait, wait.

215
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,577
I bought a card. Give me $2.

216
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,042
For the record,
this is why I hate gift-giving.

217
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,091
- Who is it?
- It's the groom.

218
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,678
You can't come in.
Bad luck to see the bride.

219
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,681
Okay, fine.

220
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,685
Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother!
I'll be right back!

221
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,229
Why can't she drive herself?

222
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,857
She doesn't wanna sit in her dress
and wrinkle it!

223
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:22,068
So I'm gonna lay her down
in the back of my neighbor's van!

224
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,697
All right, just hurry!

225
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:30,577
Okay, I'll see you later, Ma...
Uh, lovely bride-to-be!

226
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,122
I really gotta watch that.

227
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,005
Come on, Raj, we're ready to start.

228
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,466
We're ready when I say we're ready.

229
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,387
Oop. Ahem.

230
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,724
Okay. Now we're ready.

231
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:57,061
Ma, you wanna move your chair
over here so you can see?!

232
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:01,608
I'm fine where I am!
I don't wanna fall off the roof!

233
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,487
You'll fall through the roof
before you fall off it.

234
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,574
Penny?

235
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:17,624
Your new mother-in-law
is a piece of work.

236
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,417
Not now, Dad.

237
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,628
She's got a bigger mustache than me.

238
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,507
Here you go.

239
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,929
Here you go? What am I, a football?

240
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,980
Like that guy could catch a football.

241
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,902
"Howard and Bernadette,
the five of us stand before you...

242
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,988
...as your friends
and newly ordained ministers."

243
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,658
Louder!

244
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:56,579
They all got ordained!
They're all marrying us! It's adorable!

245
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,831
If you wanna hear, come closer!

246
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:06,714
"Guys, when I look at the two of you
starting your lives together...

247
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,676
...it fills my heart...

248
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,138
it fills my heart..."

249
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,057
Okay, I'm gonna need a minute.

250
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,102
Okay, I'll go. Ahem.

251
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,645
"Howard and Bernadette...

252
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:24,148
...I know you two planned on getting
married in a big, fancy wedding.

253
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,986
When you're in love, it doesn't matter
where or how these things happen.

254
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,531
It just matters
that you have each other."

255
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,158
Hmm.

256
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:39,539
- Problem?
- No.

257
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,002
I think the Reverend Hofstadter
is making an ironic connection...

258
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,004
...between your statement
about love...

259
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,340
...and your rejection of his proposal
in the bedroom.

260
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,633
Oh, grow up.

261
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,760
- Hey, I didn't say it.
- That's enough.

262
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,221
- Well, he started it.
- Well, I'm ending it.

263
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:03,604
"Bernadette, I wanna thank you for
allowing me to be your maid of honor.

264
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,358
I also want you to know
that I will be happy to do it again...

265
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,028
...if this marriage craps out."

266
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,412
Thank you, Amy. Very touching.

267
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,707
"Howard and Bernadette...

268
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,918
...you are lucky enough
to be best friends who love each other.

269
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,714
And that's the strongest kind of love,
because at its core...

270
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:34,302
...it has kindness, patience
and respect."

271
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:38,639
Qualities that are hard to find
in people these days.

272
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,022
Would you like some aloe vera?

273
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,107
You just got burned.

274
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,029
All right, my turn. Ahem.

275
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,532
"Howard, Bernadette:"

276
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,623
Sheldon, I told you, no Klingon.

277
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,630
Fine, I'll do it in English,
but it loses something.

278
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:16,385
"The need to find another human being
to share one's life with...

279
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,304
...has always puzzled me.

280
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,142
Maybe because I'm so interesting
all by myself.

281
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,898
With that being said, may you find
as much happiness with each other...

282
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,818
...as I find on my own."

283
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,487
The Klingon would have made you cry.

284
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,367
I believe you two have prepared vows?

285
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:48,000
Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you,
this is going to be short and sweet.

286
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:55,716
I love you with all my heart and soul
and promise to be with you forever.

287
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,474
Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski...

288
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,434
Speak up!

289
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,688
Hey, from now on, she's the only
woman who can yell at me!

290
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,991
Until I met you, I couldn't imagine
spending my life with just one person.

291
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:27,707
And now I can't imagine spending
one day of it without you.

292
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,963
By the power vested in us
by the state of California...

293
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,548
And the Klingon High Council.

294
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,930
ALL:... we now pronounce you
husband and wife.

295
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,327
That's ignition.

296
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,412
I love this part!

297
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,080
Me too!

298
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,459
I have strongly mixed feelings.

299
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,630
Oh, my God, it's happening.

300
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,216
- Did I miss it?
- No, come on in. Hurry.

301
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,845
I love that man.

302
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,139
Me too.

303
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,853
I can't believe it.

304
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,815
This whole time,
a small part of me thought he was lying.

305
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,405
