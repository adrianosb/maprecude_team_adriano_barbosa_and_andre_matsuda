- Sheldon, I'm not waiting on you.
- Obviously.

319

I don't even have water yet.

320
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:31,807
Because you're not here.

321

That's discrimination
against the otherwise located.

I'm going to have to go
over your head.

- Is that Steve Wozniak?
- I think it is.

The great and powerful Woz.

328
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,695
Penny, Steve Wozniak was one
of the co-founders of Apple computer.

329
00:17:58,869 --> 00:17:59,995
He and Steve Jobs...

330
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,900
Yeah, I know who he is.
I watch Dancing With the Stars.

331
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,171
I must speak to him.

Of course you must.

There's an Olive Garden down the street.
You guys should try it sometime.

little achievement.
