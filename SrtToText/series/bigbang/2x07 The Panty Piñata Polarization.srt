00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:50,172
...we will put a Wolowitz
on one of <i>America's Top Models.</i>

157
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,811
And a large number of people
will believe it never happened.

158
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:57,443
Okay, let me guess.

159
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,087
Quesadilla with soy cheese...

160
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:01,382
- ...for lactose-intolerant Leonard.
- Thank you.

161
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:04,549
Shrimp caesar salad with no almonds
for the highly allergic...

162
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:07,093
...kosher-only-on-the-High-Holidays
Howard.

163
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:09,754
And for our
suddenly-back-on-the-Hindu-wagon Raj...

164
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:11,456
...meat lover's pizza, no meat.

165
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:15,135
Coming right up.

166
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,637
Wait. Excuse me. You forgot
my barbecue bacon cheeseburger...

167
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,140
...barbecue sauce,
bacon and cheese on the side.

168
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:23,139
Oh, I didn't tell you?

169
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,042
You're banished
from the Cheesecake Factory.

170
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,649
- Why?
- Well, you have three strikes.

171
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,415
One, coming in. Two, sitting down.

172
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:35,079
And three, I don't like your attitude.

173
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:38,827
You can't do that. Not only is it a violation
of California State Law...

174
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,987
...it flies directly in the face
of Cheesecake Factory policy.

175
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:45,895
Yeah, no, there's a new policy:
No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.

176
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,403
I bet we could sell that sign
all over Pasadena.

177
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,499
- Penny, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Uh-huh.

178
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:57,808
- Hi.
- Hi.

179
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,175
Look, here's the thing.

180
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,841
I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible.

181
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,683
And he agrees that he was unreasonable
and out of line.

182
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,291
- Really? Well, that's great.
- Yeah.

183
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:12,359
Oh, just apologize to him, okay?

184
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:15,596
What? I'm not gonna apologize
to that nutcase.

185
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:19,428
Come on, it's easy.
He'll even tell you what to say.

186
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:23,871
Don't you get it? You keep going along
with his insanity, you're encouraging him.

187
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,704
We're not encouraging.
It's more like knuckling under.

188
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:32,874
I like hanging out but I'm not gonna
apologize for something I didn't do.

189
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,212
Well, actually, technically you did do it.

190
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:40,151
That's strike one, Leonard.

191
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,315
Here you go. Quesadilla.

192
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:44,618
Salad.

193
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:46,159
Here's your pizza.

194
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:49,560
And thanks to Sheldon's heated discussion
with my manager...

195
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,896
...barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue
sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.

196
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,201
Thank you.

197
00:10:56,772 --> 00:10:57,898
Go ahead. Eat it.

198
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:05,043
I dare you.

199
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:15,552
That's it. There's the house.
I found America's top models!

200
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:17,283
- Are you sure?
- Look. On the roof.

201
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,759
Anaïïs and Giselle are sunbathing.

202
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,558
European style.

203
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,034
You can recognize people
on Google Earth?

204
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:31,071
Of course not. I got a buddy of mine
at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.

205
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:34,141
NORAD? You're using military aircraft?

206
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,007
It was already targeted
to poke around a nuclear reactor in Siberia.

207
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,512
I took it an hour out of its way, tops.

208
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,543
Okay, where is he?

209
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:46,119
Sheldon? I dropped him off
at the comic book store.

210
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:48,881
Here. Try and go online.

211
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:51,720
- Problem with the Wi-Fi?
- No, just try.

212
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:54,059

Oh, Penny,
you don't wanna get into it with Sheldon.

224
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:37,101
The guy's one lab accident away
from being a super villain.

225
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:43,008
I don't care. I was in junior rodeo.
I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.

226
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,079
No need to neuter the nerd.
I can get you back online.

227
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:49,508
There, see?

228
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,653
Problem solved.

229
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:53,948

00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:12,263
What are you complaining about?
I'm the one who has to take the class again.

235
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:20,710
Oh!

236
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:23,409
Hello.

237
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:26,621
Time to do your laundry, huh?

238
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:28,483
Saturday night.

239
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:30,591
Saturday is laundry night.

240
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,425
I know.

241
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:35,189
Every Saturday at 8:15.

242
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:38,060
Easy to anticipate.

243
00:13:40,135 --> 00:13:41,625
SHELDON:
What are you implying?

244
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:44,671
I'm implying
that you're a creature of habit.

245
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,072
And if something were to prevent you from
doing your laundry on Saturday at 8:15...

246
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,475
...you might find it...

247
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:53,706
...unpleasant.

248
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:01,880
Knuckle under, my ass.

249
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,322
Oh, no.

250
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:13,093
Are all the machines taken?

251
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:17,037
What are you gonna do?

252
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,505
No problem.

253
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:23,372
I'll just do my laundry another night.

254
00:14:23,546 --> 00:14:25,013
Another night?

255
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,045
Well, I guess you can try...

256
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:32,984
...but deep inside your heart you'll know
that laundry night is always Saturday night.

257
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:41,054
Woman, you are playing with forces
beyond your ken.

258
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,294
Yeah, well,
your Ken can kiss my Barbie.

259
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:50,262
Sheldon?

260
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:52,236
Sheldon? Sheldon?

261
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,044
Yes?

262
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,642
Where are my clothes?

263
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,113
- Your clothes?
- Yes. I left them in the washers.

264
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:04,149
I went to get them,
they were gone.

265
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,225
Really? Despite the sign that says:
"Do not leave laundry unattended"?

266
00:15:10,392 --> 00:15:12,155
Sheldon, where are my clothes?

267
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:16,389
You know, I do recall
seeing some female undergarments.

268
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:18,999
Where was that? Oh, yes.

269
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,726
Earlier this evening...

270
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:26,000
...I happened to gaze out the window
and a brassiere caught my eye.

271
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:28,433
Do those look familiar?

272
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:31,944
How the hell did you get them up
on that telephone wire?

273
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:36,710
When you understand the laws of physics,
Penny, anything is possible.

274
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:40,722
And may I add:
Mua-ha-ha.

275
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,349
- Get them down.
- Apologize.

276
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,823
- Never.
- Then I suggest...

277
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:48,361
...you get a very long stick
and play panty piñata.

278
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:51,191
Look, wait, Sheldon.

279
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,028
This has gotten out of hand. Okay.

280
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,000
I've done some stupid things,
you've done some stupid things.

281
00:15:56,171 --> 00:15:58,366
How about call it even,
move on with our lives?

282
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,030
I've done no stupid things.

283
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,541
- Look, you've gotta meet me halfway here.
- I am.

284
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,544
I'm willing to concede that you've
done some stupid things.

285
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,149
Hey, you guys are talking again. Good.

286
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:15,451
What happened?

287
00:16:15,624 --> 00:16:17,558
Leonard,
remember when I said it was on?

288
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,217
Well, now it's junior rodeo on.

289
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:24,427
Oh, not junior rodeo.

290
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,996
What did you do?

291
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:30,730
I had no choice, Leonard.
She ruined laundry night.

292
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:34,436
Ooh!

293
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,744
SHELDON:
Mua-ha-ha.

294
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:50,450
Telephone wires can't electrocute you,
can they?

295
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:53,194
No. Look, this has to stop.

296
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:56,263
- Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.
- All right.

297
00:16:56,865 --> 00:17:00,164
I really didn't wanna do this...

298
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:02,761
...but here.

299
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:04,599
What this?

300
00:17:05,674 --> 00:17:07,767
Sheldon's kryptonite.

301
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,770
Oh, my God.

302
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:15,976
He can never know
that I gave that to you.

303
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:18,979
Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but--

304
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:21,054
But this?

305
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:26,886
It will shorten the war by five years
and save millions of lives.
