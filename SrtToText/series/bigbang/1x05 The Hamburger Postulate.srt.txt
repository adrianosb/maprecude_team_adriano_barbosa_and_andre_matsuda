All right,
I'm moving my infantry division...
...augmented by a battalion of orcs
from Lord of the Rings.
We flank the Tennessee volunteers...
...and the North once again
wins the Battle of Gettysburg.
Not so fast. Remember, the South
still has two infantry divisions.
Plus Superman and Godzilla.
No, no, no. Orcs are magic.
Superman is vulnerable to magic.
Not to mention,
you already lost Godzilla...
...to the lllinois cavalry and Hulk.
Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee
charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh?
-You guys ready to order?
-Hang on.
Shiva and Ganesh?
The Hindu gods
against the entire Union Army?
And orcs.
I'll be back.
Excuse me. Ganesh is the remover
of obstacles and Shiva's the destroyer.
When the smoke clears,
Lincoln will be speaking Hindi...
...and drinking mint juleps.
My boss says you have to either
order or leave and never come back.
What do you recommend for someone
with a man-sized appetite...
...from a morning of
weight-training and cardio-funk?
A shower.
I'll take the heart-smart platter.
All right, thank you. And Sheldon?
We don't eat here.
I don't know what's good.
-Well, it's all good.
-Statistically unlikely.
Just get a hamburger.
You like hamburgers.
I like the hamburgers
where we usually eat.
You can't make the assumption
that I'll like the hamburgers here.
I'm sorry. Give him a hamburger.
Which one,
the classic, the ranch house...
...the barbeque burger
or the Kobe burger?
Can't we just go to Big Boy?
-They only have one burger, the Big Boy.
-The barbeque burger's like the Big Boy.
In a world that already
includes a Big Boy...
...why would I settle for something
like a Big Boy?
Because you are not at Big Boy.
-Fine. I'll have the barbeque burger.
-Make it two.
Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
Hey, Leonard. Hi, guys.
-Hey.
-Hey, Leslie.
-I didn't know you ate here.
-We don't. This is a disturbing aberration.
Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across
the hall from Sheldon and me.
And walks in quiet beauty
like the night.
Howard, I've asked you not to do that.
Leslie and I do research together
at the university.
Oh, wow. A girl scientist.
Yep. Come for the breasts,
stay for the brains.
So I'm glad I ran into you.
The Physics Department string quartet
needs a new cellist.
What happened to Elliott Wong?
Switched over to high-energy
radiation research, had a mishap.
And now the other guys
are uncomfortable sitting next to him.
-So are you in?
-Yeah, sure. Why not?
-We rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.
-Why at my place?
Yeah, Department of Energy said
our regular space is kind of a hot zone.
-Nice meeting you.
-Yeah, you too.
Leonard, I didn't know
you played the cello.
Yeah, my parents felt
that naming me Leonard...
...and putting me
in advanced-placement classes...
...wasn't getting me beaten up enough.
If you're into music, I happen
to be a human beatbox...
-...so....
-Really?
[BEATBOXlNG]
I'm actually not that into music.
Your friend's really cute.
Anything going on with you two?
Leslie?
No, no. What, are you kidding?
He asked her out once.
It was an embarrassing failure.
Thank you, Sheldon.
I'm sorry.
Was that supposed to be a secret?
That's too bad.
You guys would make a cute couple.
-Oh, dear.
-What's the matter?
She didn't take my order.
How could she take your order
when you're too neurotic to talk to her?
Nevertheless,
this will be reflected in her tip.
LEONARD: What did Penny mean,
"you'd make a cute couple"?
I assume she meant
the two of you...
...would constitute a couple
that others might consider cute.
An alternate and less likely interpretation
is that you could manufacture one.
As in, "Look, Leonard and Leslie
made Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb.
Aren't they adorable? "
If Penny didn't know
that Leslie had turned me down...
...then that would mean that she, Penny,
thought I should ask her, Leslie, out...
...indicating that Penny had no interest
in me asking her out.
But because she did know
I had asked Leslie out...
...and that she, Leslie,
had turned me down...
...then she, Penny,
could be offering consolation.
"That's too bad,
you would have made a cute couple."
But while thinking,
"Good, Leonard remains available."
You're a lucky man, Leonard.
How so?
You're talking to one of
the three men in the West...
...capable of following
that train of thought.
Well, what do you think?
I said I could follow it,
I didn't say I cared.
[PLAYlNG CLASSlCAL MUSlC]
I admire your fingering.
Thank you.
Maybe sometime you can
try that on my instrument.
LESLlE: Good night, guys. Good job.
-Thanks.
See you next week.
-That was fun. Thanks for including me.
-You're welcome.
If you're up for it, we could practice
that middle section again.
Sure. Why not?
[STARTS PLAYlNG]
Just so we're clear, you understand
me hanging back to practice with you...
...is a pretext for letting you know
that I'm sexually available.
[CLATTERlNG]
Really?
Yeah, I'm good to go.
I thought you weren't interested in me.
That was before I saw you handling that
beautiful piece of wood between your legs.
You mean my cello.
No, I mean the obvious,
crude double entendre.
I'm seducing you.
No kidding.
What can I say?
I'm a passionate and impulsive woman.
So how about it?
Gee....
-ls it the waitress?
-Penny? What about her?
I saw your pupils dilate
when you looked at her...
...which, unless you're a heroin addict,
points to sexual attraction.
I did have a poppy-seed bagel
for breakfast...
...which could give
a positive urine test for opiates...
...but certainly not dilate my pupils...
...so I guess there was no point
in bringing it up.
-You and the waitress, then.
-No, no.
There's nothing going on
between Penny and me.
So you're open to a sexual relationship?
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.
-Good.
-Yeah, it is.
It is good.
Did you wanna start now?
-Why don't we finish this section first?
-Oh, okay.
A little musical foreplay. Terrific.
[RESUMES PLAYlNG]
[PLAYlNG FASTER]
-I'm-- Good to go.
-Me too.
Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What's going on?
I need your opinion
on a matter of semiotics.
-I'm sorry?
-Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols.
It's a branch of philosophy
related to linguistics.
Okay, sweetie, I know you think
you're explaining yourself...
...but you're really not.
Just come with me.
[BRYAN ADAMS' "HAVE YOU EVER
REALLY LOVED A WOMAN" PLAYlNG]
Well?
-Well, what?
-What does it mean?
Come on, you went to college.
Yes, but I was 1 1.
A tie on the doorknob usually means
someone doesn't wanna be disturbed...
...because they're, you know,
getting busy.
So you're saying
Leonard has a girl in there?
Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack
and gotten really into Bryan Adams.
LESLlE [FLATLY] :
Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
We really shouldn't be standing here.
This is very awkward.
Oh, come on. You know,
Leonard's had girls over before, right?
Oh, yes. But there's usually planning,
courtship, advance notice.
You know, last time, I was able to book
a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.
Wait, wait. You had to leave the state
because your roommate was having sex?
I didn't have to.
The dates just happened to coincide.
So do you know who's in there?
Well, there's Leonard.
And he's either with Leslie Winkle
or a 1 930s gangster.
Hmm. Good for him.
Good for Leonard.
Okay. Night.
No, don't. Wait, hold on.
-What's the matter?
-I don't know what the protocol is here.
Do I stay? Do I leave?
Do I wait to greet them
with a refreshing beverage?
Gee, Sheldon,
you're asking the wrong girl.
I'm usually on the other side
of the tie.
[DOOR CLOSES]
[DlALlNG]
Hi, Leonard?
It's me.
Sheldon.
In the living room.
I just--
I wanted you to know I saw the tie.
Message received.
You're welcome.
You carry on. Give my best to Leslie.
Big Boy.
[EXHALES]
[CLEARS THROAT]
Someone touched my board.
Oh, God, my board.
[PANTlNG]
Leonard.
Leonard!
Hey, what's the matter?
Equations.
Someone's tampered with my equations.
-Are you sure?
-Of course.
Look at the beta function
of quantum chromodynamics.
The sign's been changed.
Oh, yeah.
But doesn't that fix the problem
you've been having?
Are you insane?
Are you out of your mind?
Are you--? Hey, look, that fixes
the problem I've been having.
You're welcome.
You did this?
Yeah. I noticed it when I got up
to get water, so I fixed it.
Now you can show quarks are
asymptotically free at high energies.
Pretty cool, huh?
"Cool"?
Listen, I gotta get to the lab.
Thanks for a great night.
Thank you. I'll see you at work.
-Hold on. Hold on.
-What?
-Who told you you could touch my board?
-No one.
I don't come into your house
and touch your board.
There are no incorrect equations
on my board.
Oh, that is so, so....
I'm sorry, I gotta run. If you
come up with an adjective, text me.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Inconsiderate. That is the adjective.
Inconsiderate.
You can stare at your board all day,
she's still going to be right.
SHELDON:
I'm not staring, I'm mulling.
-Oh, hey, Leonard.
-Hi.
[TEASlNG]
So how's it going?
[lMlTATES PENNY]
Pretty good.
Just pretty good? I'd think
you were doing very good.
"Pretty, very." There's really no objective
scale for delineating variations of good.
Why do you ask?
Well, a little bird told me that
you and Leslie hooked up last night.
-Sheldon!
SHELDON: I'm coming.
So is it serious? Do you like her?
I don't....
That's really two different questions.
I'm not--
Sheldon, we have to go.
Boy, you're wound awfully tight
for a man who just had sexual intercourse.
All right, well, I'll talk to you later.
But I am so happy for you, Leonard.
Thank you.
[DOOR CLOSES]
What did she mean, she's happy for me?
Is she happy because I'm seeing someone
or because she thinks I'm happy?
Because anyone who cared for someone
would want them to be happy...
...even if the reason for their happiness
made the first person unhappy.
You know, because the second person,
though happy...
...is now romantically unavailable
to the first person.
Do you realize I may have to share
a Nobel Prize with your booty call?
You know what?
I'm being ridiculous.
But who cares what Penny thinks?
Leslie is a terrific girl.
She's attractive. We like each other.
She's extremely intelligent.
SHELDON: She's not that intelligent.
LEONARD: She fixed your equation.
SHELDON: She got lucky.
LEONARD: You don't believe in luck.
I don't have to believe in it
for her to be lucky.
Regardless, I have a chance
at a real relationship with Leslie.
I'm not gonna pass that up for
some hypothetical future happiness...
...with a woman who may
or may not want me to be happy...
...with the woman
who is currently making me happy.
SHELDON: Leonard.
LEONARD: Yeah?
SHELDON:
I still don't care.
Hey, Leslie.
Careful, Leonard. Liquid nitrogen,
320 degrees below zero.
Brrrr. Heh.
Why are you smashing
a flash-frozen banana?
Because I got a bowl of Cheerios
and I couldn't find a knife.
So anyway, hello.
What are you doing?
Just extending the intimacy.
Hey, do you wanna slip over
to the radiation lab...
...and share a decontamination shower?
Okay, what exactly do you think's
going on between us?
I'm not sure, but I think I'm about
to discover how the banana felt.
Neither of us are neuroscientists, but we
both understand the biochemistry of sex.
Dopamine in our brains is released
across synapses, causing pleasure.
Stick electrodes in a rat's brain,
give him an orgasm button.
He'll push that thing
until he starves to death.
Well, who wouldn't? Heh.
The difference between us and the rat...
...is you can't stick an electrode
in our hypothalamus.
That's where you come in.
Yeah, well,
I'm just glad to be a part of it. Heh.
So, what happens now?
Well, I don't know about your sex drive,
but I'm probably good till New Year's.
Oh.
Okay.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
-You wanna make plans for New Year's?
-Please, you're smothering me.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Hey, look. It's Dr. Stud.
Doctor what?
The blogosphere is abuzzing
with news of you and Leslie...
...making the bang, bang music.
-Well, how did it get on the lnternet?
-I put it there.
Well, how did you know about it?
A little bird told us.
Apparently, you are a magnificent beast.
Well, that part's true.
I think I may have
misjudged this restaurant.
-No kidding.
-I don't wanna go out on a limb...
...but I think we may be looking
at my new Tuesday hamburger.
Your old Tuesday hamburger
will be so brokenhearted.
Way ahead of you.
I was thinking of moving Big Boy to
Thursdays and just dropping Souplantation.
-Really?
-Yeah.
The name always confused me, anyway.
Souplantation.
You can't grow soup.
-So how's everything?
-Terrific.
You'll be happy to know I plan to come
every Tuesday for the foreseeable future.
Really? Oh, yay. Heh.
Who do I speak to about
permanently reserving this table?
I don't know, a psychiatrist?
PENNY:
So, hey.
-How are things with you and Leslie?
-Oh.
To be honest,
I don't think it's going to work out.
Oh, that's too bad.
Well, hey, don't worry.
I'm sure there's someone out there
who's just right for you.
Well, what did she mean by that?
Was that just a generic platitude
or was that a subtle bid for attention?
You know why this hamburger
surpasses the Big Boy?
This is a single-decker,
whereas the Big Boy is a double-decker.
This has a much more satisfying
meat-to-bun-to-condiment ratio.
-Are you even listening to me?
-Of course I'm listening.
Blah, blah, hopeless Penny delusion,
blah, blah, blah.
Okay, then.
You know, you can grow
the ingredients for soup.
