1
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,474
- What the hell?
- Emergency-preparedness drill.

2
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,686
- Oh, no. Come on.
- Yeah, you know how it works.

3
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,022
Once a quarter, keep our readiness up.

4
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,443
Now, rise and shine, sleepy head.
Half the town is probably dead.

5
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,405
I have to get a lock for my door.

6
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:35,075
I think you'll like the drill tonight.
I've tried to make it fun.

7
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:39,955
Each of these cards contains a detailed
scenario of a possible apocalyptic event.

8
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:44,960
Everything from wildfires
to a surprise invasion by Canada.

9
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,839
Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe.

10
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:54,136
Sheldon, Canada is not
going to invade California.

11
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:58,140
Yeah, really? You think those hippies
in Washington and Oregon can stop them?

12
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,226
Oh. Fine.

13
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:07,149
Alrighty. An 8.2-magnitude
earthquake devastates Pasadena...

14
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:11,195
...reducing mighty edifices to dust,
engulfing the city in flames...

15
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:14,865
...the streets flow with blood
and echo with the cries of the wounded.

16
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,827
Oh, excellent choice.
Now, put on your hard hat and safety vest.

17
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:22,414
Oh, fun. I get to spend
another night in front of our apartment...

18
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,459
...dressed like one of the Village People.

19
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:31,215
You make that joke every three months,
I still don't get it. Leonard, wait.

20
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,802
- What are you doing?
- I don't know. What am I doing?

21
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:39,223
Look around you, there's hypothetical
broken glass everywhere.

22
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:45,771
Really? You're going to face Armageddon
without your orthotics? Your choice.

23
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,024
- Uh-oh! Hypothetical aftershock.
- Unh! Aah!

24
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,903
And that's why we wear hard hats.

25
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,222
Check it out. Press release. From NASA.

26
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,726
Ahem. "Expedition 31 will launch this spring
to the International Space Station.

27
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:28,063
Crew members will include
Commander Tom 'Tombo' Johnson...

28
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:33,318
...astronaut Mike 'Supernova' Novacelik,
and payload specialist Howard Wolowitz."

29
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:38,365
This is going right into
my synagogue's newsletter.

30
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:43,120
If you're going to be an astronaut,
you need to pick a cool nickname.

31
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,831
I don't get to.
The other guys have to give it to me.

32
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,626
Oh. If I had one,
it would be Brown Dynamite.

33
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:55,591
Are you not listening to me? The other
astronauts have to give you your nickname.

34
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,552
Are you not looking at me?
I am Brown Dynamite.

35
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,308
Why do you put six sugars
in your coffee?

36
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:08,645
Because the cafeteria doesn't offer
little packets of methamphetamine.

37
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,773
- Emergency drill night last night, huh?
- Uh-huh.

38
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:15,110
- How'd you do?
- I'll tell you exactly how he did.

39
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,865
"Readiness: Unsatisfactory.
Follows direction: Barely."

40
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,242
"Attitude: A little too much."

41
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:27,623
"Overall: Not only will he
probably die in a fiery inferno..."

42
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,002
"...his incessant whining would
most certainly spoil everyone else's day."

43
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,549
You know what, I'm so tired
I can't even think straight. I'm going home.

44
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,052
Can one of you
give this nutbag a ride later?

45
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,639
You can't go home.
You have to take me to the dentist at 4:00.

46
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:47,100
- Oh. Can't you take the bus to the dentist?
- Of course I can.

47
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,854
It's coming back under the effects
of the anesthesia that's the problem.

48
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,398
Two years ago,
after a deep gum cleaning...

49
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,861
...I thought I got on a bus but somehow
wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico.

50
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,826
- They put you under for a cleaning?
- Yeah, they have to. I'm a biter.

51
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:09,456
Okay, whatever. Sheldon, I'm exhausted.
I'm not taking you to the dentist.

52
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,835
Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under Section 37B
of the Roommate Agreement...

53
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,339
...Miscellaneous Duties,
you are obligated to take me to the dentist.

54
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:23,262
See? Here, after "providing a confirmation
sniff on questionable dairy products."

55
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,140
You know what?
I am sick of the Roommate Agreement.

56
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,854
It's ridiculous, I'm your roommate,
not your chauffeur.

57
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,982
I had better things to do yesterday...

58
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,527
...than drive you to the good
model train store in Garden Grove...

59
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:42,656
...because the one in Pasadena
has gotten too big for its britches.

60
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,159
Well, it has. Ask anybody.

61
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,412
I don't care. I'm done.

62
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:53,083
Hold on. Are you saying that
you want to invoke Clause 209?

63
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,087
I don't know what that is, but if it means
I can go home and sleep, then yes.

64
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,507
Think carefully here.
Clause 209 suspends our friendship...

65
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,343
...and strips the Roommate Agreement
to its essentials.

66
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,138
Our responsibilities toward
each other would be rent...

67
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,058
...utilities and a perfunctory chin jut
of recognition as we pass in the hall.

68
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,727
What's up?

69
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,607
Where do I sign?

70
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,194
Right here. Use your finger.

71
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,448
- There. Done.
- All right.

72
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:28,660
That's it. We are now
no longer companions, boon or otherwise.

73
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,829
We are now merely acquaintances.

74
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,791
To amend the words of Toy Story,
you have not got a friend in me.

75
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:40,672
- I'm gonna go home and take a nap.
- Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares.

76
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,468
I got pretty exciting NASA news today.

77
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:50,390
Next week, I fly to Houston for orientation
and zero-gravity elimination drills.

78
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:54,102
- What does that mean?
- He's gonna learn to poop in space.

79
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,024
Open the pod bay doors, HAL.

80
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,487
Maybe your nickname
should be Brown Dynamite.

81
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:10,327
Hello, dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter.

82
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,415
What's up?

83
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,292
My apologies.

84
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,880
I would've been here sooner but the bus
kept stopping for other people to get on it.

85
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,383
I saved you a dumpling.

86
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,510
Oh. Your concern for me is touching.

87
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,805
It will serve you well
when you take me to the dentist tomorrow.

88
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,309
I'm sorry, Sheldon, I'm busy. I'm right
in the middle of my addiction study.

89
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:39,064
I've got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys,
and tomorrow we switch them to O'Doul's.

90
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,318
You're my girlfriend and
you're not going to cater to my every need?

91
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,737
Oh, where'd the magic go?

92
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,408
Sheldon, that's not
what girlfriends are for.

93
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,911
Although, you don't use them
for what they're for, so what do I know?

94
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,004
Howard doesn't make me
do his shopping, take him to the dentist...

95
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:07,300
- ...or pick up his dry cleaning, right?
- Absolutely. But when Ma's hips give out...

96
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,885
...you're up, kid.

97
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:14,975
Well, if Amy's too busy, it gives the rest of
you an opportunity to make my life easier...

98
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,186
...thus assuring yourselves
a footnote in my memoirs...

99
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,106
...tentatively entitled
You're Welcome, Mankind.

100
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:25,193
All right, then. Just shout when you hear
the task you want to undertake.

101
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,404
Uh, dentist.

102
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,743
Okay, we can circle back
to that one. Um...

103
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:38,415
Who wants to take me Wednesday morning
to get new heels put on my dress shoes?

104
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,795
Anyone? Oh.

105
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,714
That one had "hoot" written all over it.

106
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,967
Um, all right. Uh, dermatologist.

107
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,180
Allergist.

108
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,391
Podiatrist.

109
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,894
Supercuts?

110
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,480
Okay, okay, here's a fun one.

111
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:06,776
Um, I need a new picture frame and
I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs.

112
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,446
Who wants to spend the day
with me at Ikea?

113
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,241
- Their meatballs are good.
- What?

114
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,035
Nothing. Nothing.

115
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,289
Hello, Stuart.

116
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,833
Oh, hey, Sheldon.
Can I help you find something today?

117
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,794
No, I was just sitting at home...

118
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:28,924
...thinking about how it might be nice
to catch up with my ninth-favorite person.

119
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,843
- Ninth?
- You moved up one.

120
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,597
My pen pal in Somalia
was kidnapped by pirates.

121
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,309
So, uh, how are you?

122
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,939
Uh, not so good.
My shrink just killed himself...

123
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,399
...and blamed me in the note.

124
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,987
Great, great.

125
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,660
So, what's new with your family?
How's your mother? Is she alive?

126
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,119
Yeah.

127
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,831
- Your father. Alive?
- Yes.

128
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,752
- How about your grandparents, they alive?
- No.

129
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,463
Oh, I'm so sorry for your loss.

130
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:13,093
On a cheerier note, I have a teeth-cleaning
appointment this afternoon.

131
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,013
What do you say you take me over there,
buddy boy?

132
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,808
Sorry, you want me to take
you to the dentist?

133
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,644
Yes. And, now,
I can't make any promises...

134
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:27,857
...but that's the sort of thing that gets a fella
on the list for the number eight friend slot.

135
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,319
Sheldon, I'm working.
I can't take you to the dentist.

136
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:37,158
Also, and I can't stress this enough,
I don't want to take you to the dentist.

137
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,829
Can't help a friend out
in a time of need, huh?

138
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,081
I see where your therapist
was coming from.

139
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,480
Ooh, ooh. What about we make
your astronaut nickname...

140
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:55,817
...Howard "Buzz" Wolowitz?

141
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:59,404
You can't do Buzz. Buzz is taken.

142
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:02,032
Buzz Lightyear is not real.

143
00:10:05,828 --> 00:10:07,787
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

144
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:10,707
Well, are you talking about
when he thought he was real?

145
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:15,086
No.

146
00:10:16,088 --> 00:10:20,175
Okay, um, oh, how about Crash?
Howard "Crash" Wolowitz.

147
00:10:21,636 --> 00:10:26,473
Terrific. The astronauts would love hurtling
through space with a guy named Crash.

148
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:31,853
All right, uh, how about...?
Oh, how about Rocket Man?

149
00:10:33,648 --> 00:10:35,941
That's not bad.
Howard "Rocket Man" Wolowitz.

150
00:10:36,108 --> 00:10:38,985
It's great, but I told you,
I don't get to pick my nickname.

151
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:41,154
It has to come from the other astronauts.

152
00:10:41,322 --> 00:10:43,865
Maybe there's a way
to get them to come up with it.

153
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:45,450
Like how?

154
00:10:45,618 --> 00:10:47,786
Once I tried carrying around
a Duncan yo-yo...

155
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:51,122
...hoping the other kids
would start calling me Duncan.

156
00:10:51,624 --> 00:10:54,751
- Did it work?
- No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth...

157
00:10:56,587 --> 00:11:00,340
...because they took away my yo-yo
and stuffed their socks in my mouth.

158
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:07,097
Okay. Uh, what if we make
"Rocket Man" your ringtone...

159
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:11,685
...and the next time you talk to those guys,
I'll call you and they'll hear it.

160
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:13,478
That's not a terrible plan.

161
00:11:13,646 --> 00:11:16,898
They don't call me
Brown Dynamite for nothing.

162
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:21,444
- What's up?
- What's up?

163
00:11:23,072 --> 00:11:24,698
You ever make it to the dentist?

164
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:29,786
Not necessary. I found a service that'll send
a van to your house for a teeth cleaning.

165
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:31,955
Mostly they cater to dogs...

166
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,419
...but the fellow on the phone
seemed to have an open mind.

167
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,715
All right, Sheldon, if you need me
to take you to the dentist, I will take you.

168
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:44,509
Are you suggesting
that you've come to your senses...

169
00:11:44,677 --> 00:11:49,389
...and wish to reestablish the benefits
that stem from the Roommate Agreement?

170
00:11:49,557 --> 00:11:54,102
Absolutely. If you admit you're a 30-year-old
man incapable of functioning on his own.

171
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:57,480
Ooh. Sock Mouth's got him on the ropes.

172
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:02,319
I will admit nothing of the sort.
And now, if you'll excuse me...

173
00:12:02,486 --> 00:12:06,823
...I have to call my dentist and see if I can
get my hair shampooed and nails clipped.

174
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:21,463
- Oh, good, your power's out too.
- Why is that good?

175
00:12:22,131 --> 00:12:25,508
Last month, I sent the electric company
a Starbucks gift card...

176
00:12:25,676 --> 00:12:28,845
...an apology note
and a few snapshots of me in a bra.

177
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:33,116
Power failure.
Implementing power-failure protocol.

178
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:38,521
What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark
emergency-exit stuff painted on the floor?

179
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:40,732
Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic.

180
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:45,945
Anyway, too bad you're no longer entitled
to the full benefits of my friendship...

181
00:12:46,113 --> 00:12:49,824
...because I happen to be
extremely prepared for such an emergency.

182
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:52,744
Please try not to see anything
by this light.

183
00:12:53,162 --> 00:12:54,204
It's not for you.

184
00:12:55,956 --> 00:12:58,541
It's a blackout,
I'm sure the power will be back on soon.

185
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:03,004
And I'm sure some fool in the Donner Party
said the snow would stop any day now.

186
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:06,466
I like to think they ate him first.

187
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,469
I got candles in my apartment.

188
00:13:09,637 --> 00:13:12,972
Candles? During a blackout?
Are you mad? That's a fire hazard.

189
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,477
No, Pasadena Water and Power
recommends the far safer glow stick.

190
00:13:18,854 --> 00:13:21,231
You call that a glow stick?

191
00:13:26,195 --> 00:13:28,196
That is a glow stick.

192
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:30,198
Come on, let's go.

193
00:13:30,366 --> 00:13:32,033
Before you go, consider this:

194
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:35,745
Not only do I have a deep-cycle
marine battery power source...

195
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:38,498
...more than capable of running
our entertainment system...

196
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:43,336
...I also have all 61 episodes
of the BBC series Red Dwarf.

197
00:13:43,504 --> 00:13:46,464
And Fiddle Faddle.

198
00:13:46,632 --> 00:13:50,885
All yours if you're willing to reinstate
the Roommate Agreement.

199
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:54,722
I've got wine at my place
and some bubble wrap we could pop.

200
00:13:59,562 --> 00:14:04,607
He'll be back. Wine and a girl in the dark,
he's gonna be bored out of his mind.

201
00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:08,194
To wine and bubble wrap.

202
00:14:10,573 --> 00:14:14,284
And to not having to watch Sheldon
demonstrate his reverse-osmosis machine...

203
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:16,953
...that converts urine into drinking water.

204
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:23,042
You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dineesha
said you could do that with panty hose.

205
00:14:23,836 --> 00:14:25,670
Boy, was she wrong.

206
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,382
Anyway, you wanna make out?

207
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:34,679
I thought because our relationship's in
a beta test, you wanted to take things slow.

208
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:37,807
Okay. Do you wanna make out slow?

209
00:14:39,894 --> 00:14:43,563
I can go so slow it'll be like
there's a snail in your mouth.

210
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:47,066
Oh...

211
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:52,113
Lucky for you
there's nothing else to do right now.

212
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,285
- Excuse me, Leonard.
- Since when don't you knock?

213
00:14:57,453 --> 00:14:59,579
It's, like, the only good thing about you.

214
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:03,875
Social niceties have been suspended.
We're in a state of emergency.

215
00:15:04,502 --> 00:15:07,086
The world has descended
into darkened turmoil...

216
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:10,632
...lawlessness and savagery
are the order of the day.

217
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:13,593
- Fine, what is it?
- I'm making s'mores.

218
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:18,431
I wanted to alert you in case you smelled
caramelizing marshmallows...

219
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:21,226
...and thought
a nearby candy factory was on fire.

220
00:15:21,393 --> 00:15:23,520
- S'mores, huh? Good for you.
- Yes.

221
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:28,900
Or good for us if you sign here and
reinstate the full Roommate Agreement.

222
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:30,151
No, thanks, I'm good.

223
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:32,237
Really? Oh.

224
00:15:32,404 --> 00:15:36,032
Okay. In that case,
I will have a s'more by myself.

225
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,452
And then I'm gonna have some more.

226
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:44,332
By myself.

227
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:47,043
- Aw.
- Now, don't "aw" him...

228
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:48,545
...he brought all this on himself.

229
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:51,047
- But he's sad.
- No, he's crazy.

230
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:54,217
Sometimes crazy looks like sad
so it'll suck you back in.

231
00:15:57,054 --> 00:15:58,721
I think he misses his little buddy.

232
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:02,433
Fine.

233
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:07,647
But mark my words, this frustrating bogus
teenage make out session is not over.

234
00:16:17,825 --> 00:16:19,492
You said candles were dangerous.

235
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,494
This is a Bunsen burner.

236
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:25,665
I'm a scientist. I know what I'm doing.

237
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:28,209
Oh, drat.

238
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:38,052
Oh. It took me a gallon of urine
to make that water.

239
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:44,892
Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid.
I don't see why we can't be friends.

240
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,812
I'm willing to drive you
and help you out with stuff...

241
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,523
...I just don't want to
because of some agreement.

242
00:16:51,191 --> 00:16:54,611
- What are you proposing?
- That we go back to the way things were.

243
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:58,072
But when I do something for you,
you show a little appreciation.

244
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:00,575
How would I do that?

245
00:17:02,036 --> 00:17:05,288
- You say "thank you."
- Every time?

246
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:08,875
It's not crazy.

247
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:11,419
Counter-proposal.

248
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:15,048
We reinstate the full Roommate Agreement
with the following addendum:

249
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:20,136
In the spirit of Mother's Day
or Father's Day, once a year...

250
00:17:20,304 --> 00:17:24,432
...we set aside a day to celebrate
all your contributions to my life...

251
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,727
...both actual and imagined by you.

252
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:31,022
We could call it Leonard's Day.

253
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:34,817
I kind of like the sound of that.

254
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:38,029
Of course you do.
It's about you, like everything else.

255
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:43,451
Oh, thank goodness. I don't think I had it
in me to make another glass of water.

256
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:46,454
So do I get breakfast in bed
on Leonard's Day?

257
00:17:46,622 --> 00:17:48,581
- No.
- Can I sit in your spot?

258
00:17:48,749 --> 00:17:51,459
- No.
- Could I control the thermostat?

259
00:17:51,627 --> 00:17:53,670
- No.
- Do I get a card?

260
00:17:53,837 --> 00:17:55,505
Of course you get a card.

261
00:17:56,382 --> 00:17:58,132
It's Leonard's Day.

262
00:17:59,051 --> 00:18:02,387
Hey, guys. The building manager said
the reason the power went out...

263
00:18:02,554 --> 00:18:06,474
...is someone went into the basement
and pulled the main breaker switch.

264
00:18:09,395 --> 00:18:10,770
Really.

265
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:13,981
Who do you think did that, Sheldon?

266
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:17,026
Oh, I don't know.

267
00:18:19,446 --> 00:18:23,449
But whoever that mystery man was,
you should be eternally grateful...

268
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:27,078
...for without him,
there would be no Leonard's Day.

269
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:29,122
Leonard's Day?

270
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:31,833
No pressure,
just get him a crummy card, you're good.

271
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:40,106
All right, test my ringtone.

272
00:18:40,274 --> 00:18:42,025
♪ Rocket man ♪

273
00:18:42,192 --> 00:18:44,777
♪ Burning out his fuse up here alone ♪

274
00:18:44,945 --> 00:18:49,282
- It really is a good song.
- Yeah, there's a reason he's Sir Elton John.

275
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,244
They don't make you a knight for writing
"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go."

276
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,040
Howard,
are you coming down for breakfast?

277
00:18:57,207 --> 00:19:01,252
Ma, I told you, I have a video conference
with NASA! I said don't bother me!

278
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,547
Ooh, listen to Mr. Big-Shot-Astronaut!

279
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:08,259
Yes, please listen
to Mr. Big-Shot-Astronaut!

280
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:14,474
Hey. Good morning.

281
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:16,934
Hey, Howard.
Thanks for getting up so early.

282
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:19,729
No problem, Dr. Massimino.

283
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:21,564
The guys here call me Mass.

284
00:19:21,732 --> 00:19:26,235
Mass. That's a cool nickname, because
force equals mass times acceleration.

285
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:30,073
Yeah. It's just short for Massimino.

286
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:34,327
Anyway, the plan for this morning
is to go over the...

287
00:19:35,871 --> 00:19:37,663
Sorry. My phone.

288
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,583
What is that? Is that "Rocket Man"?

289
00:19:40,751 --> 00:19:44,670
Yeah, it's my ringtone.
Kind of my favorite song, "Rocket Man."

290
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:49,509
Howard,
your Froot Loops are getting soggy!

291
00:19:51,178 --> 00:19:52,470
Not now!

292
00:19:53,013 --> 00:19:55,848
- Who's that?
- My mom. Sorry.

293
00:19:56,016 --> 00:19:59,185
No problem, Fruit Loops.
