1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,868
You'll never believe
what happened to me at work.

2
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:09,337
This old guy was choking on his food
and I saved his life.

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:10,668
Did you Heimlich him?

4
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:13,277
No, I said,
"I think that old guy's choking."

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,675
Then one of the busboys Heimlich'd him.

6
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:19,378
You're a hero.

7
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:22,514
Yeah, that was the point of the story.

8
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:26,257
Do you know
if you have Thursday night off?

9
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,825
Uh, I think so, why?

10
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,790
Why? It's Valentine's Day.

11
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,430
Oh, right.
Yeah, we can do something.

12
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:36,797
- You could be a little more into it.
- I'm into it, I'm into it.

13
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:40,097
There's pressure to make the night special
and it never works out.

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,334
Well, this time it's gonna be different
because I'm like a romance ninja. Heh.

15
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:49,710
You don't see it coming and then... Bam!
Romance! Watch out! Hearts, kisses, love!

16
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,111
Ooh! Ya!

17
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:55,516
Sometimes I think I've made you
cooler than you used to be...

18
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,916
...then you go
and do that.

19
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:03,719
So in conclusion,
I believe the painful sensation felt...

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,899
...after passing a meal
of spicy chilies is proof...

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,866
...that the rectum does possess
the sense of taste.

22
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:20,610
I concur, but you changed the subject.
What are we doing for Valentine's Day?

23
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,380
Oh, you caught that, did you?

24
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,307
Okay.

25
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,305
Okay.

26
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,310
Okay.

27
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,655
Okay. Okay!

28
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,686
Okay.

29
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,486
Everything okay?

30
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,964
Bernie's a little cranky since
she's been working, like, 17 hours a day.

31
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:23,165
I've got a lot on my plate too. I've been
busting my tail playing "Assassin's Creed."

32
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,870
Stuart, you got anything going on
for Valentine's Day?

33
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,538
Not really, other than hiding
all the sharp objects around here...

34
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,082
...and white-knuckling it till morning.

35
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,809
What do you got going on?

36
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,352
I was gonna spend the night
with my special little lady...

37
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,356
...but she got worms
and then I had to take her to the vet.

38
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,722
There must be something
we can do.

39
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,994
Uh, how about, uh,
you keep the store open late...

40
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,763
...and we throw a party for people
who don't have dates?

41
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,070
That actually sounds kind of nice.

42
00:02:55,275 --> 00:03:00,372
The theme will be that the greatest love
a man can have is love he has with himself.

43
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,175
That's good...

44
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:08,878
...or maybe something
a little less hand-in-the-pants.

45
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,384
Oh. Alex, excellent.

46
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:16,858
I have a research problem
that I believe you can help with.

47
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,553
Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank you.

48
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:22,223
I've been waiting for an opportunity
to contribute to your scientific work.

49
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,560
Oh, no, that's not gonna happen. No.

50
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:33,204
What I need you to do is find
a Valentine's gift for my girlfriend.

51
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:38,407
I passed up an opportunity to work at
Fermilab to take this job with you.

52
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,588
Well, I guess those chaps will have to have
someone else buy their girlfriends presents.

53
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,626
Now, here is... Oh, let's see...
This is...

54
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,426
This is about $2000.

55
00:03:56,502 --> 00:04:00,768
Um, I think she likes monkeys
and the color gray.

56
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,638
Contribute to my work. Heh.

57
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,315
Ah, kids say the darndest things.

58
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,951
- Hey, you coming to lunch?
- Yeah, one second.

59
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,751
- I wanna show you something.
- What?

60
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:26,694
I was trying to come up with something
really romantic to give Bernadette...

61
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,960
...for Valentine's Day
since she's been such a pain in the ass.

62
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,697
You can't find a card that says that?

63
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,711
Check it out. I used the atomic-force
microscope in the materials-science lab...

64
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:46,317
...and wrote our initials in a heart one
one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.

65
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,677
Oh, that's cool.

66
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:53,154
A micro-Valentine for a microbiologist. Heh.

67
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,988
From her micro-husband.

68
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,559
That is amazing.
How long did this take you?

69
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,863
Ah, about 12 hours.
I pulled an all-nighter. Heh.

70
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,063
Oh, wow.

71
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,404
Yeah, I know, it really took a bite
out of my video-game time.

72
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,168
What are you and Penny doing?

73
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,711
I'm gonna take her
to a nice restaurant for dinner.

74
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:21,414
That's not bad, but as far as romance goes,
I think my gift hits it right out of the...

75
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,756
- Wanna come to dinner with us?
- Yes, please.

76
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:37,227
Okay, uh, Amy will be here shortly
expecting the perfect Valentine's gift.

77
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,873
So you're up, kid, dazzle me, go.

78
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,741
Okay, I think I have some great choices.

79
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,701
I went on Amy's Facebook page
and read her interests...

80
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,882
See?
I never would've thought to do that.

81
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,878
Clearly I made a good choice
farming this out to you.

82
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,385
I'm telling you,
Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot.

83
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,022
Anyway...

84
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,656
...my socks are on.
Let's knock them off.

85
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,962
Well, um, I know
she loves playing the harp...

86
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:14,732
...so I found this beautiful music box
that plays one of her favorite songs.

87
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,803
Now, Amy already has a real harp...

88
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,374
...and it can play any song.

89
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,245
What are you trying to pull here?

90
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,415
- No, it's just I thought...
- Next.

91
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,119
Okay, um, I know she's a fan
of The Canterbury Tales...

92
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:36,318
Mm.

93
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:42,457
...so I found this cool map that illustrates
the characters' journey through England.

94
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,933
We could put it in a really nice frame.

95
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:49,230
But she's got Google Maps on her phone.

96
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,310
I don't know how to respond to that.

97
00:06:55,848 --> 00:07:00,444
I hope it's with a third good option
because these first two: Blah.

98
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:07,124
Okay, well, uh, luckily
I saved the best for last.

99
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,456
Since Amy's a neuroscientist,
I did some research...

100
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:14,759
...found out that Santiago Ramon y Cajal,
the father of modern neuroscience...

101
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,458
...did lots of hand drawings of brain cells.

102
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:23,638
And I managed to find this signed print.

103
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,505
Wow.

104
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,646
Oh, this is truly remarkable.

105
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,881
- Thank you.
- I think I'll keep it for myself.

106
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,983
- What about your girlfriend?
- Too late, I called dibs.

107
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,820
This place is really beautiful.

108
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,056
Wah. Romance ninja.

109
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,293
Hey.

110
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:52,801
- Sorry we're late.
- Hey.

111
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,495
No problem. We just sat down.

112
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,268
- Mm. Would you like some wine?
- Fill her up.

113
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,536
I'll tell you when to stop.

114
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,313
Is everything okay?

115
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,042
Terrific. Couldn't be better.

116
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,513
Oh, bite me.

117
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,486
We can still have a nice night.
Just tell me where it is.

118
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:16,992
If you did what you said
you were gonna do, I'd tell you.

119
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,690
- Uh, where what is?
- She hid my Xbox like I'm a child.

120
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:26,569
My mom got me that for my birthday,
so if you don't give it back, I'm telling.

121
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:32,002
I've been working late every night.
All I asked was he clean the apartment...

122
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,111
...and do one load of laundry.
Did he? No.

123
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,939
He kept on playing
that stupid game.

124
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:39,874
You like pushing buttons so much,
try pushing them on the washing machine.

125
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:46,321
- I said I'm sorry.
- Sorry doesn't clean my underpants, buddy.

126
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,688
I told you. Turn them inside out.

127
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,764
And I told you to bite me.

128
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,435
Trying to have a magical night here, guys.

129
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,204
- Oh, son of a bitch.
- What?

130
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,571
- Nothing. Nothing.
- No, tell me.

131
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,774
It's just this guy I used to date.

132
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,974
Oh.

133
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,449
Until he cheated on me with my friend
Gretchen, who's here with him.

134
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,888
- You're kidding.
- And it looks like she lost a lot of weight.

135
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,580
Damn it.

136
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,752
I know it's not ideal,
but don't let them ruin our night.

137
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:27,228
No, you're totally right.
She could be skinny because she's dying.

138
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,963
That's the spirit.

139
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,627
Screw them. Our night's gonna be
way more special than theirs.

140
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,234
Uh-oh.

141
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,907
What?

142
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,573
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

143
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,685
- Oh, my God! Yes! Of course I'll marry you!
- Ha, ha.

144
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,322
Two can play this game. Penny...

145
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,287
- Get up.
- All right.

146
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,729
Nice that the people
who are Ionely on Valentine's Day...

147
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,836
...can come here tonight
and be together.

148
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,336
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.

149
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,066
In fact, there's no place
I'd rather be than here.

150
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,440
- Except on a date with anybody.
- Literally anybody.

151
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,410
You and I have so much fun hanging out.

152
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,451
If you were a girl,
all of our problems would be solved.

153
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,382
What?

154
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,623
Think about it. We'd hang out,
we'd read comic books, we'd see movies.

155
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,889
It'd be like the best relationship ever.

156
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,129
- It does sound nice.
- Then I'd take you home...

157
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,898
...slip off your little, black dress
and pile-drive you into oblivion.

158
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,267
What?

159
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:52,315
I can't believe he's gonna marry the girl
he cheated on me with.

160
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,576
Isn't it kind of nice?

161
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:56,482
He was with the wrong person.
Now he found the right person.

162
00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:00,284
So I'm the wrong person?
Maybe you wanna be with Gretchen too.

163
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:03,927
They do look happy.

164
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,188
Yeah, maybe tonight.

165
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,923
But a year from now, he'll be crawling
under the sink looking for his Xbox.

166
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,596
Well, he will.

167
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,702
Why don't we just forget about them
and enjoy our Valentine's Day?

168
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,500
Yes, absolutely.

169
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:27,980
Heh. Now they're doing that phony,
link-arm-drink thingy.

170
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,621
I totally taught him that.

171
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,925
- I thought we were letting it go.
- We were. It's just not fair, okay?

172
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,152
They're bad people.

173
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,628
Not supposed to end happy for them,
it's supposed to end happy for me.

174
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:44,164
Um, it did end happy for you.
You're here with me.

175
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,133
Yeah, yeah, I know.

176
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,232
This is getting hard
to not take personally.

177
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,444
- Come on. Don't make this about you.
- I'm not. It's about you.

178
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,079
Yeah, whatever.
I told you Valentine's Day sucks.

179
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:58,477
- This one does, and you're the reason why.
- What?

180
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,051
Compared to them,
I'm feeling pretty good about us.

181
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:07,490
Me too. How about we blow off dessert,
go home early? I'll do that laundry.

182
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:08,851
Thank you.

183
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,823
- I love you.
- Love you too.

184
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,865
- So where'd you hide it?
- Where you'd never look.

185
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,000
Damn it, it's in the washing machine.

186
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,710
- Hello.
- Hello.

187
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,342
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- Okay.

188
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,521
- Shall we go to dinner?
- Hang on.

189
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,214
As you know,
I had planned a traditional evening...

190
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,916
...of romance and gifts.

191
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:46,565
Yes, and as you know,
I planned to pretend to enjoy it.

192
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:51,025
I've been working
on this facial expression all day.

193
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,200
And I appreciate your effort...

194
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:59,002
...but upon contemplation,
I decided I was being selfish.

195
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,202
So I canceled our dinner reservations...

196
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:05,042
...and came up with an even better way
to celebrate Valentine's Day.

197
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,549
- What is that?
- By doing none of it.

198
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,513
No dinner, no romance, no gifts.

199
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,156
We stay here, order a pizza...

200
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:17,556
...and watch one
of your beloved Star War Trek things.

201
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,054
Really?

202
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,961
That's what you'd love, isn't it?

203
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:23,596
More than anything.

204
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,427
Well, then, that's what we're gonna do.

205
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,571
Well, I don't know what to say.

206
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:37,172
This is the most thoughtful gift
that anyone's ever given me.

207
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:41,750
And that's including an amazing gift
I gave myself earlier today.

208
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,614
I'm your girlfriend, that's my job.

209
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:52,287
I know gift-giving puts pressure on you
so whatever you got me, you can return.

210
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,623
No.

211
00:13:56,101 --> 00:14:00,094
After everything you didn't do
for me tonight, I want you to have it.

212
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,505
- What's this?
- Read it.

213
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,577
"Sheldon Cooper,
Caltech University employee information"?

214
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,838
At the bottom.

215
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:14,848
"In case of emergency,
please contact Amy Farrah Fowler."

216
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,723
And there's my phone number.

217
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:26,189
This is the most beautiful gift
you could've ever given me.

218
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:31,735
I thought if I have a stroke
or a kidney stone...

219
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,496
...who would I want to share that with?

220
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,141
And you picked me.

221
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,144
- It's like you said, you're my girlfriend.
- Oh, Sheldon.

222
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:55,488
Okay, stop ruining Valentine's Day
and order my pizza.

223
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,327
- Night.
- Yep.

224
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,335
You know what?

225
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,243
That was pretty crappy of you.

226
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,641
All I wanted to do
was give you a great night...

227
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,409
...and it's like you went out of your way
to destroy it.

228
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,951
- Yep. I know. I'm a total bitch.
- I'm not saying that.

229
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,679
- Well, I am.
- Fine, you win, you're a bitch.

230
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,359
Why couldn't we just have a nice time?

231
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,763
I don't know.

232
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:37,368
Maybe because things are going so well
between us lately and I've been happy.

233
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,110
Okay, you're gonna have to make
a lot more sense than that.

234
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,909
Obviously,
I have some commitment issues.

235
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,779
- Glaringly obvious. Go on.
- As long as things keep going great...

236
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:58,423
...you'll keep asking me to marry you.
Eventually, I'll end up saying yes.

237
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,617
Then we're gonna be married forever
and the whole thing just freaks me out.

238
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,224
Okay.

239
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,595
I know I propose a lot.

240
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,063
So how about this?

241
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:20,143
I promise I will never ask you
to marry me again.

242
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,575
What do you mean?
Are you breaking up with me?

243
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,147
No. No, no, no.

244
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,479
But if someday, you decide
you wanna get married...

245
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,586
...you have to propose to me.

246
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,655
- Really?
- Yes.

247
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,953
It's all on you.

248
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,856
But when the time comes,
I want the whole nine yards.

249
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,589
I want you down on one knee, flowers.
I wanna be swept off my feet.

250
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,229
Yeah, you got it.

251
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:48,600
And I'm cool with surprises,
but nothing on a Jumbotron.

252
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,139
I don't wanna cry on a big screen like that.

253
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,042
Okay.

254
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,611
You know what?

255
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:04,652
This might be the wine talking,
but I have an important question to ask you.

256
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:06,982
You do?

257
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,684
Leonard Hofstadter?

258
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,459
Yes?

259
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,666
Will you be my Valentine?

260
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,294
Sorry, maybe next year.

261
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,302
I'm just kidding! Romance ninja!
Let's have sex! Wah!

262
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,774
Thank you, guys, for doing this.

263
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,509
We're glad you could make it.

264
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:39,815
Usually, I spend Valentine's Day sad
and alone. This year, I'm just sad.

265
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,923
What is it about this holiday
that makes people so unhappy?

266
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:48,565
I know. I hate myself most of the time,
but tonight's the night I know...

267
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,894
...everyone else does too.

268
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:52,996
I think you're cool.

269
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,163
Great.

270
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,870
I gotta tell you. We've gotta stop
beating ourselves up like this.

271
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:08,515
Excuse me, everybody.
Can I have your attention, please?

272
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:17,185
We're all here tonight
because we have no one to be with.

273
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:22,093
But that doesn't make us mutants.

274
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:25,030
The only mutants here
are in these comic books.

275
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:32,700
We gotta stop defining our self-worth
by whether or not we're in a relationship.

276
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,609
You know what I see when I look around?

277
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,077
I see a room full of great people.

278
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:45,856
So let's give ourselves a break.
We are a community.

279
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:50,552
And as long as we have each other,
we're never truly alone.

280
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:01,065
That was cool, what you said.

281
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,875
- You really think so?
- Yeah, I do.

282
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,476
Thank you.

283
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:14,611
Uh, would you like to, uh,
get a cup of coffee?

284
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,910
Okay.

285
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,789
Later, losers!

286
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,233
Hello?

287
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:44,011
Another medical emergency?
What's wrong with him now?

288
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:49,248
I seriously doubt he was bitten
by a Chinese bird spider.

289
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,619
How exactly does a bump feel Asian?

290
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,417
Put him on the phone.

291
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,561
Sheldon, I'm not driving over there again.

292
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,393
Because I drove over there yesterday
for a brain tumor...

293
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,865
...that turned out to be
an ice-cream headache.

294
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,436
Yes, I still want to be
your emergency contact.

295
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:16,771
Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast
and also have a brain tumor.

296
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,548
I'm on my way.

297
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,320
Brain tumor would explain a lot.
