Thailand has had the fork
since the latter half of the 19th century.

They don't put the fork in their mouth,
they use it to put the food on a spoon...

1 20 miles an hour, hits them...

I do not have this!

Yes, but they all involve

Easy. Easy.

102
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,826
Exactly half.

00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:14,394

See, it's moving. This is easy.

107
00:05:23,473 --> 00:05:24,906

This is chaos.

...where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid?

133

I'm just inferring that this as a couch...

134
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:52,060
...because the evidence suggests
the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.

No.

138
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:03,565
Well, they don't.

139
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:05,206
Hard as it may be to believe...

140
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:09,868
...most people don't sort their breakfast
cereal numerically by fiber content.

141

Excuse me, but I think
we've both found that helpful at times.

-Come on, we should go.
-Hang on.

143
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,923
-What are you doing?
-I'm straightening up.

144

Sheldon, this is not your home.

This is not anyone's home.
This is a swirling vortex of entropy.

When the transvestite lived here,
you didn't care how he kept the place.

147
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,364
Because it was immaculate.

148
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,529
I mean, you open that man's closet...

149
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:43,009
...it was left to right, evening gowns,
cocktail dresses and his police uniforms.

150
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:47,379
-What were you doing in his closet?
-I helped him run some cable for a webcam.

151

-Hey, guys.
-Oh, hey, Penny.

152
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,612
This just arrived.
Brought this up. Just now.

153
00:07:51,787 --> 00:07:54,017
Great. Was it hard getting up the stairs?

154
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,350
-No.
-No?

155
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:59,188
-No.
-No.

156
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:01,330
-We'll get out of your hair.
-Okay, great.

-Hi.
-Oh.

315
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,501
What's going on?

316
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:44,740
Uh....

317
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:46,881
Here's the thing:

318
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:56,949
"Penny, just as Oppenheimer came to regret
his contributions to the first atomic bomb...

319
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:59,390
...so too I regret my participation
in what was...

320
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:02,325
...at the very least, an error in judgment.

321
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:05,526
The hallmark
of the great human experiment...

322
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:07,965
...is the willingness
to recognize one's mistakes.

323
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:11,868
Madam Curie's discovery of radium
turned out to have great potential...

324
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,340
...even though she would later die a slow,
painful death from radiation poisoning.

325
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,674
Another example,
from the field of Ebola research--"

326
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,373
Leonard.

327
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:24,143
yeah?

328
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:28,251
We're okay.

329
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,041
LEONARD: Six two-inch dowels?
-Check.

330
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,476
-One package Philips head screws?
-Check.

331
00:18:52,648 --> 00:18:54,616
Guys, seriously, I grew up
on a farm, okay?

332
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:56,978
I rebuilt a tractor engine
when I was, like, 1 2.

333
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:59,712
I think I can put together
a cheap Swedish media center.

334
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,721
Please, we insist.
It's the least we can do, considering--

335
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:03,983
Considering what?

336
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:06,992
How great this place looks?

337
00:19:07,362 --> 00:19:09,762
-Oh, boy, I was afraid of this.
-What?

338
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:12,457
These instructions
are a pictographic representation...

339
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:15,432
...of the least imaginative way
to assemble these components.

340
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:18,437
This right here
is why Sweden has no space program.

341
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:22,868
-lt looked pretty good in the store.
-lt is an inefficient design.

342
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:24,637
For example,
Penny has a flatscreen TV...

343
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:26,838
...which means all this space
behind it is wasted.

344
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:29,643
-We could put her stereo back there.
-And control it how?

345
00:19:29,818 --> 00:19:34,084
Run an infrared repeater,
photocell here, emitter here, easy-peasy.

346
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,190
-Good point. How will you cool it?
-Guys, I got this.

347
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:39,520
-Hang on, Penny.
-How about fans?

348
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:43,096
-Here and here.
-Also inefficient, and might be loud.

349
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,790
How about a liquid cooler?
A little aquarium pump here.

350
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:47,458
Run some quarter-inch PVC--

351
00:19:47,636 --> 00:19:49,467
Guys, this is actually really simple.

352
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:51,797
Hold on, honey, men at work.

353
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:57,645
PVC comes here. Maybe a little
corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.

354
00:19:57,813 --> 00:20:01,271
Show me where we put a drip tray,
a sluice and a overflow reservoir?

355
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,385
If water's involved,
we'll ground the crap out of the thing.

356
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:08,216
Guys, it's hot in here.
I think I'll just take off all my clothes.

357
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:14,656
Oh, I've got it.

358
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:20,430
What if we replaced panels A, B and F and
crossbar H with aircraft-grade aluminum?

359
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:22,763
-Entire thing's one big heat sink.
-Perfect.

360
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:26,499
Leonard and Sheldon, go to the junkyard
and pick up 6 square meters of aluminum.

361
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:29,473
-Raj and I will get the oxyacetylene torch.
-Meet in an hour?

362
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,408
-Done.
-Got it.

363
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:36,581
Okay, this place does look pretty good.

364
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:05,269
