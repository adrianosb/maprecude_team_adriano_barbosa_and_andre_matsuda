1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,588
Gentlemen, I think I've come up
with a fun way...

2
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,508
...to get young people
interested in science.

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,344
Physics Mad Libs.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,681
Now, give me a number.

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,641
- Five.
- Uh-huh.

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,102
And an irrational constant.

7
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,729
E.

8
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,313
And a funny Greek letter.

9
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,316
- Gamma.
- I said funny.

10
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,445
- Upsilon?
- Heh, good one.

11
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,406
And an electrical charge.

12
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,034
- Positive.
- Ha, ha! Perfect.

13
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,911
Okay, get this. Ahem.

14
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,539
"Professor Jones
told the symposium...

15
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:44,835
...he had a new method
for calculating the mass of a muon.

16
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,880
Five times the limit of, heh...

17
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,467
...e to the upsilon as it approaches..."

18
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:52,801
Ha, ha, oh, my gosh. Okay.

19
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,386
Okay, no, no. Ahem.

20
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,388
I'll start over.

21
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,681
"Professor Jo..."

22
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,311
I haven't seen him laugh that hard...

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,772
...since the day Leonard
made that multiplication error.

24
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,399
Oh, Lord, that multiplication error.

25
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,777
He thought he carried the one,
but he didn't.

26
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,740
It's not funny.
That mistake got published.

27
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,618
Stop, I'm gonna wet myself.

28
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,746
Guys. Guys, President Seibert
is headed this way.

29
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,248
- I wonder what he wants.
- He doesn't look happy.

30
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,750
I'm guessing he wants Sheldon.

31
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,627
- Dr. Cooper.
- Told you.

32
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,295
Ah, President Seibert.

33
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,214
I assume you'd like to respond...

34
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,258
...to one of the suggestions
I put in the box by your office.

35
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,678
No, and stop installing
suggestion boxes everywhere.

36
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,931
You don't like written suggestions.

37
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,101
You don't like when I give them
to you while in the men's room.

38
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,437
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you're one of those people...

39
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,981
...who are not open to suggestions.

40
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,860
Dr. Cooper, the Physics Department
tells me you're refusing to take vacation.

41
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,738
- I don't need a vacation.
- You're obligated to take one.

42
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,866
And I'd like you to know
the most often received suggestion...

43
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,869
...in my suggestion box you installed
without asking me is:

44
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,038
"Can Dr. Cooper take a vacation?"

45
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:07,167
Okay, it's settled, then. I'll see you all
on Monday. Except for you.

46
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,087
But if I don't come into work,
what am I supposed to do?

47
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,548
Read, rest, travel.

48
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,259
I hear Afghanistan is nice
this time of year.

49
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,012
Sarcasm?

50
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,973
No, you should go.

51
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:52,379
Tonight's gonna be a good night

52
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:56,007
And tonight's gonna be a good night

53
00:02:56,342 --> 00:03:00,804
And tonight's gonna be a good, good night

54
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:04,432
Tonight's the night, uh, uh
Let's live it up, uh

55
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,477
I got my money
Let's spend it up...

56
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,646
Good Lord.

57
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,856
Would you stop that caterwauling?

58
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,319
What the hell are you doing?

59
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,072
Bleeding from my ears.

60
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:22,283
- What are you doing hiding back there?
- I'm sneaking into work.

61
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,704
Now, if the guard at the university
asks what's under the blanket...

62
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:28,206
...you tell him it's some lobster traps.

63
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:30,458
- Lobster traps?
- Yes.

64
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:34,671
That's how Velma and Scooby smuggled
Shaggy into the old lighthouse.

65
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,882
What are you gonna do
when you get to the university?

66
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,384
People are gonna recognize you.

67
00:03:41,178 --> 00:03:43,179
Will they, Leonard?

68
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:51,020
Fine. Just get back under your blanket
and I'll drive you there.

69
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:53,857
And no more singing.

70
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,194
Fine.

71
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:06,035
I have GPS on my phone.
I know you turned around.

72
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:09,914
I'm so glad you talked Howard...

73
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:13,418
...out of having your wedding invitations
in Klingon.

74
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:16,254
Turn it over.

75
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,259
I'm hoping my relatives
think it's Hebrew.

76
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,221
This is really happening.

77
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,973
I'm gonna be a maid of honor.

78
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:30,059
'I'm gonna wear a beautiful dress
and walk down that aisle...

79
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:33,897
...and finally,
I will have my special day.

80
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:35,648
You mean my special day.

81
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,611
They're gonna need an extra-large veil
for somebody's head.

82
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,115
- If I actually ever get married.
- Why wouldn't you?

83
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,243
My dad. Because I make
a lot more money than Howie...

84
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,621
...he's putting a lot of pressure on me
to get a prenup.

85
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:51,581
- Ouch!
- Yeah.

86
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,168
- Howie's gonna freak out.
- Parental pressure can be daunting.

87
00:04:55,377 --> 00:04:58,797
I remember the battle with my mother
about shaving my legs.

88
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,634
Last year, I finally gave in
and let her do it.

89
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,597
I just don't know
how I'm gonna break it to him.

90
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,892
I'm a believer in breaking bad news
to a guy when you're in bed.

91
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:13,812
That's how I told my high school
boyfriend I slept with his brother.

92
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:17,398
That's how I told his brother
the same thing.

93
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:21,778
I don't know.
I don't wanna manipulate him with sex.

94
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:24,113
Oh, sweetie, that's what sex is for.

95
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,284
The connection between marriage
and money is nothing new.

96
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:31,162
The term "wed" referred
to the money and livestock...

97
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,081
...the groom paid the bride's father.

98
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,709
For example, you're adorable,
intelligent and a good earner.

99
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,713
I could conservatively see you going
for at least two oxen and a goose.

100
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:44,968
You would fetch a unicorn.

101
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:51,474
Sheldon, there are a million
great vacations you could take.

102
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,851
What about Hawaii?

103
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,689
Hawaii is a former leper colony
on top of an active volcano...

104
00:05:57,898 --> 00:06:01,192
...where the disappointing ending
to Lost was filmed.

105
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:06,364
Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.

106
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,866
How about Florida?

107
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:10,034
They got Cape Canaveral,
they got Disney.

108
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:13,746
They got my Aunt Ida and the world's
largest collection of diabetic candy.

109
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,707
And plus, if you get sweaty enough...

110
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,501
...her plastic-covered furniture
is like a flume ride.

111
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,505
My family took a trip to Florida
when I was a child.

112
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:26,676
A seagull stole a hot dog from me
on the beach.

113
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,052
I got the message.

114
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:30,722
If I had a week off...

115
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:34,100
...I'd go back to the Two Bunch Palms
Resort and Spa in the desert.

116
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,895
I tell you, an hour on the massage table
with Trevor...

117
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:40,315
...and you'll feel like you were born
without bones.

118
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,444
I don't think I could ever let a guy
give me a massage.

119
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:48,072
Really? What was I doing to your neck
last night while you were playing Xbox?

120
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:52,368
Guys, I am living in a dictatorship.

121
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:57,457
"You must take a vacation.
You must have fun. You must enjoy life."

122
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:01,794
I don't think you have a good handle
on dictatorships.

123
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,755
Sheldon, everybody takes vacations.

124
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:07,091
One time, they tried
to make Richard Feynman take a vacation.

125
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,094
But he chose instead to expand his mind
and learn something new.

126
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,388
He went to work
in his friend's biology lab.

127
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,308
Richard Feynman
was a famous American physicist...

128
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:17,894
...part of the Manhattan Project.

129
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:21,397
Everyone in the world of science
knows who Richard Feynman was.

130
00:07:21,565 --> 00:07:23,650
Yeah, now you do too.

131
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:31,282
Oh. I have a brilliant idea.
Amy's a biologist. I'll go work in her lab.

132
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,910
Isn't that just Feynman's idea?

133
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:36,829
Ten seconds ago you never heard
of him, now you're an expert.

134
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:42,627
- Hey.
- Hey, you.

135
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:45,129
That your laundry?
You have six things in there.

136
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,631
I didn't have any quarters.

137
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,259
So I've been sneaking stuff
into other people's loads all day.

138
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:53,388
If I tell you something,
you promise not to tell anybody?

139
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:55,890
Doesn't matter what I say,
you're gonna tell me anyway.

140
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,477
Wha...? That is not true.

141
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,272
Bernadette wants a prenup.

142
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:04,899
Wow.

143
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,567
That's rough.

144
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,278
If I became a famous movie star
and we got married...

145
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:12,615
- ...you wouldn't sign a prenup?
- Heh, absolutely not.

146
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,951
If I'm gonna be at home
with the kids...

147
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,247
...while you're on location
cheating on me with Ryan Gosling...

148
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,126
...then Leonard gots to get paid.

149
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,671
So do you think about us
getting married?

150
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,297
I think about a lot of things.

151
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:31,092
I think about us getting married,
about us breaking up.

152
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:35,471
Once in a while, I think about how I didn't
leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged...

153
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,307
...but then I have a glass of wine
and it passes.

154
00:08:39,643 --> 00:08:41,602
Joke all you want,
but you think about it.

155
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:46,774
Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do
get married, no Klingon invitations.

156
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:49,986
Good luck catching a man
with that attitude.

157
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:56,409
Boy, oh, boy, this vacation
is off to a wonderful start.

158
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,037
The smell of formaldehyde.

159
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:02,331
The whir of the centrifuge.

160
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:06,544
The distant chatter of lab animals
being dispatched for dissection.

161
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,215
Mm, I can already feel my cares
just melting away.

162
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,052
I'm excited to work with my boyfriend.
It's romantic.

163
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:16,721
Way to kill the mood.

164
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:20,933
Come on, Sheldon. We can be like
Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre...

165
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,352
...who spent their days
working side by side...

166
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:26,856
...bathed in the glow of their love
and the radium that ultimately killed her.

167
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:31,778
Screw Beauty and the Beast,
that's the love story Disney should tell.

168
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,739
Okay. What do we start with?

169
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:38,534
Maybe, uh, splicing some genes.
Clone a sheep.

170
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,871
Perhaps, uh, grow a human ear
on a mouse's back?

171
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,248
"Ha, ha! I'm a freak."

172
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,419
Well, I'm gonna be doing
some brain stem histology...

173
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,464
...while you put yourself
on the business end of a sponge...

174
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:53,091
...and wash those beakers.

175
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:56,677
Wash those b... Oh, I get it.

176
00:09:56,887 --> 00:10:00,473
Little hazing for the new fellow. Yeah.
Better keep an eye out for, what...

177
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:02,475
...shoe polish on the microscope...

178
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:05,394
...or mad cow disease
in my grilled cheese sandwich?

179
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:09,482
No, I just need those beakers washed.
Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny.

180
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:12,735
Excuse me, you have
Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab.

181
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,487
You're gonna make him
do the dishes?

182
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:18,324
That's like asking the incredible Hulk
to open a pickle jar.

183
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:22,620
Sheldon, you've never worked in a lab
like this before.

184
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,123
You have no experience
in the field of biology.

185
00:10:25,332 --> 00:10:27,625
I have plenty of experience in biology.

186
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,461
I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998...

187
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:34,382
...and it's still alive. Let's do this.

188
00:10:41,723 --> 00:10:42,931
Where's Howard?

189
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:45,059
No, "Hi, Raj," no, "How are you, Raj?"

190
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:47,936
Just straight to,
"Where's the other white guy?"

191
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:50,522
I'm sorry.

192
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:54,735
So, listen, I heard something about him.
Can you keep it between us?

193
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:57,446
Ooh, gossip. When I first got here...

194
00:10:57,656 --> 00:11:00,157
...I thought Americans really gossiped
around the water cooler.

195
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:03,369
I hung out there for a month,
but the only gossip I heard...

196
00:11:03,578 --> 00:11:06,789
...was about some creepy guy
hanging out by the water cooler.

197
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,334
Bernadette wants to get a prenup.

198
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,337
Oh, that's a shame.
He's gonna be devastated.

199
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:15,631
I never know what to do
in these situations.

200
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,841
- Should I give him a heads up?
- Hmm.

201
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:20,386
I'm gonna give you the advice
I yell at the TV...

202
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:23,263
...when the Bachelor
is handing out roses.

203
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:26,308
Follow your heart.

204
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:29,311
Check it out.

205
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:34,108
Look at the size of that
Rice Krispie Treat. Same price, ha, ha.

206
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:36,527
Ahem, hey, Howard,
I need to tell you something.

207
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:40,197
I know, it's not on my wedding diet.
I don't care.

208
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:48,414
No. Listen, I heard that Bernadette's thinking
about asking you for a prenup.

209
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:50,708
A prenup?

210
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,751
Heh, wow.

211
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:54,545
What are you gonna do?

212
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,215
I don't know.

213
00:11:58,425 --> 00:12:00,384
Follow your heart.

214
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:10,018
You know what?
It's not a big deal.

215
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:12,187
I mean,
she makes more money than me.

216
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:15,816
She wants to protect
her financial interests.

217
00:12:16,025 --> 00:12:18,944
- It's completely reasonable.
- Good, that's a healthy attitude.

218
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:22,448
Actually, it's good for both of us.
I have assets to protect too.

219
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:24,533
Like what?

220
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,744
Well, I've got some rare comic books.

221
00:12:26,953 --> 00:12:29,246
You know,
the Vespa's almost paid off.

222
00:12:30,623 --> 00:12:33,375
Ma and I have a primo
double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai...

223
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:36,837
...right near the guy who played
Mr. Roper on Three's Company.

224
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:39,256
Mr. Roper's dead?

225
00:12:41,384 --> 00:12:44,011
You can't just spring that on a guy.

226
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:47,556
Here you go.

227
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:51,727
This is now the only lab with glassware
washed by a man with two doctorates...

228
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:55,272
...and a restraining order
signed by Carl Sagan.

229
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:58,108
Soap spots. Wash them again.

230
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,154
You're being ridiculous.
Those are perfectly clean.

231
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:05,365
This beaker used to contain
cerebrospinal fluid...

232
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:07,618
...from an elephant
that died of syphilis.

233
00:13:07,827 --> 00:13:10,162
If it's, in fact, perfectly clean,
drink from it.

234
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:19,713
Biologists are mean.

235
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,593
Perhaps this task
will be a little bit more up your alley.

236
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,763
I need you to count the bacteria spores
on these petri dishes.

237
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:30,098
There was something wrong
with that detergent.

238
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:33,268
- That was way too bubbly.
- I'm sure it was.

239
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:36,814
I intend to write that soap company
a strongly-worded letter.

240
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:39,983
Yeah, good for you.
Now start counting.

241
00:13:40,443 --> 00:13:42,069
You know what this place needs?

242
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:44,863
A suggestion box.

243
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:50,452
Three hundred sixty-six.
Three hundred sixty-seven.

244
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,954
How's it going?

245
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:54,081
How's counting going?

246
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,666
When I was in kindergarten...

247
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:59,878
...I recited pi to a thousand places
for the school talent show.

248
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:02,548
- I think I got this.
- Great.

249
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:10,138
Aw, nuts.

250
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,226
One.

251
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:17,688
This is preposterous.

252
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,315
You're giving me these tasks
because you're afraid...

253
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:23,986
...if you give me anything meaningful
to do, I'll show you up.

254
00:14:24,195 --> 00:14:26,029
Really? Is that what you think?

255
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:27,447
Yes, that's what I think.

256
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:30,659
And I'm super smart,
so it's probably true.

257
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:34,830
Hey, I've been training in the field
of neurobiology for 12 years.

258
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,542
You've been here three hours and
you spent one of them in the bathroom.

259
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:43,714
Well, I'm sorry, it takes me a while to get
things going on an unfamiliar toilet.

260
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:48,343
I've given you the simplest things to do
and you haven't done one of them right.

261
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:50,554
That's because
I'm not being challenged.

262
00:14:50,763 --> 00:14:52,723
It's the same reason
Einstein failed math.

263
00:14:52,932 --> 00:14:55,058
Maybe the math
was too bubbly for him.

264
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:58,228
You think you're doing science
by cutting up that brain?

265
00:14:58,438 --> 00:15:00,105
They could do the same at Quiznos.

266
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:03,567
And they'd offer to toast it for me too.

267
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:05,986
Okay, smart guy.

268
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:10,157
I'm about to remove the locus coeruleus,
which is incredibly delicate work.

269
00:15:10,783 --> 00:15:12,409
Have at it.

270
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:15,370
All right.

271
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:19,291
I'm no stranger to a little gray matter.

272
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:29,509
Locus coeruleus.

273
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:32,888
You're getting warmer.
It is indeed in the brain.

274
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:37,601
Hope your hands are steady.
It's the width of a single hair.

275
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,063
But this is just biology,
so it's no problem for a genius like you.

276
00:15:41,272 --> 00:15:44,358
It's not. I will have you know
in the field of physics we work...

277
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:48,236
...with particles so small they make
fat jokes about the locus coeruleus...

278
00:15:50,114 --> 00:15:52,783
...i.e., when your locus coeruleus
sits around the house...

279
00:15:52,992 --> 00:15:55,077
...it sits around the house.

280
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:00,582
Oh.

281
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:03,502
- Are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?
- No.

282
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:09,341
What you see
is a man trembling with confidence.

283
00:16:12,762 --> 00:16:15,138
Does the locus coeruleus
normally bleed that much?

284
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:17,724
No, but your thumb does.

285
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,980
Oh, dear.

286
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,944
Yeah, you're a biologist.

287
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:34,616
What are you doing here?

288
00:16:35,201 --> 00:16:36,910
I'm on vacation.

289
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,623
Social convention dictates that I let
my hair down at a local watering hole.

290
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,295
Social convention is stupid.

291
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:50,340
What happened to your thumb?

292
00:16:50,508 --> 00:16:52,509
Yeah, I have ten fingers
and ten toes.

293
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:56,805
If I tell you a story about each of them,
we'll be here all day. Let's move on.

294
00:16:58,141 --> 00:16:59,599
- What can I get you?
- Ah.

295
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:03,729
Seeing as I'm on vacation,
a piña colada seems appropriate.

296
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:06,440
Extra pineapple slices,
extra whipped cream...

297
00:17:06,649 --> 00:17:10,861
...extra cherries, extra umbrellas,
and, uh, hold the rum.

298
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:14,740
Don't let me have too many of those.

299
00:17:15,283 --> 00:17:17,200
Hey. What are you guys doing here?

300
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:20,370
We're grown men.
We drink at bars, heh.

301
00:17:20,913 --> 00:17:22,831
No and no.

302
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:26,960
Everything okay
with you and Bernadette?

303
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,463
Oh, yeah, sure.

304
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:33,175
- You and Amy? Good?
- Oh, better than good.

305
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:37,512
Those girls text me every detail
of their lives as it happens.

306
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,015
I'm not signing a prenup.

307
00:17:40,516 --> 00:17:44,186
All right, Wolowitz, listen up. You
sign anything she puts in front of you.

308
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:46,146
You are the luckiest man alive.

309
00:17:46,314 --> 00:17:49,107
If you let her go, there is no way
you can find anyone else.

310
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:52,861
Speaking on behalf of all women, it
is not gonna happen, we had a meeting.

311
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,572
And you.

312
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,533
A grown man fainting at the sight
of a little blood.

313
00:17:58,743 --> 00:18:03,497
Excuse me,
this is a fairly substantial wound. You...

314
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,754
Amy. Amy.

315
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:13,465
Amy.

316
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:16,676
What do you want?

317
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:21,848
I was kind of hoping I could continue
vacationing in your laboratory.

318
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:24,601
After all, I did book the whole week.

319
00:18:26,604 --> 00:18:29,231
Do you honestly think
you can just waltz back in here...

320
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,358
...after the way you behaved
yesterday?

321
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:36,738
I was not myself.
I had lost a lot of thumb blood.

322
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:42,119
- That's not an apology.
- That is your opinion.

323
00:18:42,745 --> 00:18:44,329
I want a real apology.

324
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:50,752
- I'm sorry that you weren't able to...
- No.

325
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:53,964
- That my genius got...
- No.

326
00:18:54,173 --> 00:18:57,592
- That the soap was so...
- Sheldon.

327
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:01,054
Fine.

328
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:06,226
Sorry.

329
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:08,937
You're forgiven.

330
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:10,480
Now, if you wanna stay...

331
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,984
...get started on those beakers.
They're still dirty from yesterday.

332
00:19:17,738 --> 00:19:20,490
Next year, I'm going to Epcot.

333
00:19:26,872 --> 00:19:28,623
Are you mad at me?

334
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:30,541
No. I'm not mad at you.

335
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:33,378
I just wish you would've come to me...

336
00:19:33,587 --> 00:19:37,090
...so I didn't have to hear it
through the nerd-vine.

337
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:41,511
So, what are we gonna do?

338
00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:45,556
- You really want me to sign a prenup?
- I don't know.

339
00:19:45,766 --> 00:19:47,892
My dad's pretty insistent on it,
though.

340
00:19:48,102 --> 00:19:50,019
Why don't I talk to your dad?

341
00:19:50,229 --> 00:19:52,188
- Man to man.
- Really?

342
00:19:52,398 --> 00:19:55,400
- Oh, that'd be so great. Heh.
- Done.

343
00:19:56,777 --> 00:20:00,530
I should probably give you a heads up
about a couple things.

344
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:05,159
Even though he's retired from
the police force, he still carries his gun.

345
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:09,205
But don't worry, he won't shoot it.
It's more of a fashion statement.

346
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,417
Okay, heh.

347
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:14,877
And just to be safe,
when you talk to him...

348
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:17,547
...don't bring up Jimmy Carter,
gardeners...

349
00:20:17,756 --> 00:20:21,050
...foreign people, homosexuals,
Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control...

350
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,386
...organic food,
the designated hitter rule...

351
00:20:23,595 --> 00:20:25,972
...recycling
or the fact that you're Jewish.

352
00:20:28,976 --> 00:20:32,937
Got it, got it.
Will you e-mail me that list, heh?

353
00:20:34,148 --> 00:20:37,775
So the thing to watch for,
if he's shouting at you, you're okay.

354
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:39,777
But if he starts to get real quiet...

355
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:43,698
...leave as quickly as you can
without making eye contact.

356
00:20:44,616 --> 00:20:48,286
Not in a straight line,
throw some zigs and zags in there.

357
00:20:50,956 --> 00:20:52,749
You know, this isn't that pressing.

358
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,334
Why don't I talk to him about it
in May, heh?

359
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:59,088
In May you're gonna be on
the International Space Station.

360
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:01,257
They got a phone.
