1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,367
Sheldon, your food's getting cold.

2
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:10,202
I'll eat later. Right now I'm suckling at the
informative bosom of mother physics.

3
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:14,540
It's hot when Sheldon talks dirty.

4
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:19,184
So I found this website
where you send them pictures...

5
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,344
...they sculpt your head
and make an action figure out of you.

6
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,456
- How awesome is that?
- Let me see.

7
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:27,559
You can pick your wardrobe,
you can choose your accessories.

8
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:32,255
Oh, Leonard,
you can get a little asthma inhaler.

9
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,030
Oh, this is neat.

10
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,602
Think about all the action figures
we've bought.

11
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,434
It would be kind of cool
to have one that look like us.

12
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:48,080
Yeah, if that's your idea of what's cool,
you should get one.

13
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,440
Yeah, so I'm out.

14
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:55,253
What do you think?
Want an action figure that looks like you?

15
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:58,455
- Would it come with kung-fu grip?
- No.

16
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,456
Don't waste my time.

17
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,792
You get that these
are personalized action figures.

18
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,091
Honey, if you want one, just get one.

19
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,666
- You're still out, right?
- Yup.

20
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,294
A hush falls over the crowd
as Cooper studies the board.

21
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,229
He makes his move.

22
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,737
He's dividing both sides by I,
he's adding back the coefficient.

23
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,307
He has a value for P.
He's plugging that back in.

24
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,944
He takes the derivative
and he solves the equation.

25
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,810
- Crowd goes wild. "Nobel, Nobel!"
- Cooper.

26
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,751
"Nobel." Kripke.

27
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,380
Yeah... Don't look at my board.

28
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,753
- What's that?
- That's a drawing of a really cool train.

29
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,828
Yeah, don't look at that, either.

30
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,225
- What do you want?
- I have some bad news.

31
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,300
You're working on a grant proposal
for a new fusion reactor.

32
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,302
I'm working on a grant proposal
for a new fusion reactor.

33
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,930
The university is only allowed
to submit one proposal.

34
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:27,273
So they asked you to pack up your things
and ship out. That's hard cheese, Barry.

35
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,540
You're one of the good ones.

36
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,312
No, they're making us work together.

37
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,947
That's ridiculous.

38
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,352
I am one of the great minds
of our generation.

39
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:42,119
I work on a level so rarified,
you couldn't even imagine it.

40
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,820
I said, stop looking at my cool train!

41
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:51,264
Hm. A strange place to put a picture
of you and Bernadette.

42
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:56,041
Well, I've wanted everybody
to know I love my wife, you know...

43
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,372
...and nobody to know
I forgot to turn off the laser.

44
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,611
They're here.
Our action figures have arrived.

45
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,220
It's the best $500 I've ever spent.

46
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,885
A thousand dollars on action figures?
How can you afford that?

47
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:16,061
Easy. His family is loaded
and Bernadette has a great job.

48
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,096
My wife came with both funbags
and moneybags.

49
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,735
Say hello to an exact-scale model of me.

50
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:33,135
Oh, I'm not dark chocolate.

51
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,180
I'm melt-in-your-mouth caramel.

52
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:39,482
Oh, man.

53
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,520
Look at my nose.

54
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,417
Maybe it's a shipping problem.

55
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,061
- What?
- Yeah.

56
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,257
Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam
just got action figures and look like you. Heh.

57
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:59,070
- This sucks.
- I can't believe I wasted all that money.

58
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,834
Aw, and my girlfriend
wouldn't let me get one.

59
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,874
Look at my face.

60
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,775
Do I look smug? I feel smug.

61
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,719
I hate it when you make me sit
through the credits.

62
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:17,117
Well, sometimes there's a secret ending,
like in The Avengers.

63
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,886
Yeah, but I don't think that's gonna
happen in a documentary about the Holocaust.

64
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,265
They could show bloopers.

65
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,633
- Oh, no.
- What is that?

66
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:35,797
That is Sheldon's "I'm unhappy
and about to destroy the planet" music.

67
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:40,068
- Let's just go to your place.
- Lf he's unhappy, shouldn't we talk to him?

68
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,579
"Shouldn't we talk to him?"
Have you learned nothing in six years?

69
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,753
You doing okay, sweetie?

70
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:59,591
There's ominous music playing
and there's an afghan over my head.

71
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:03,725
I don't know where you're from, but where
I'm from, that means I'm not doing okay.

72
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,001
- I'm gonna make you some tea.
- Tea is for when I'm upset. I'm not upset.

73
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,337
The university is forcing me
to work with Kripke. I'm outraged.

74
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,941
So cocoa?

75
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:16,342
Yes, cocoa.

76
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:22,915
Do you have any idea what it's like
to be paired with someone so annoying?

77
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,853
Oh, teacher, me, me.

78
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,490
You see, I did all this great work
and now he's just gonna come and ruin it.

79
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,531
I'm angrier than ever
and filled with despair.

80
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:39,831
- What beverage do you make for that?
- Oh, no, no, no, I know this.

81
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:44,604
- Hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?
- Hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks.

82
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,741
What the frig, Cooper?

83
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,014
We were supposed to be in my office
half an hour ago.

84
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,454
And yet now you're in my office.
Point Cooper.

85
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,260
Welcome to the thunderdome, Kripke.

86
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,523
We agreed to exchange copies of our work.
Let me see yours.

87
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,629
Why don't you show me yours first?

88
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,530
You think I just fell off the turnip truck?

89
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,563
We exchange at the same time.

90
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,877
How do I know you're not going
to take my ideas and publish them?

91
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,741
How do I know you're not gonna?

92
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:25,577
Yeah, because I'm not interested
in getting published in MAD Magazine.

93
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,681
The zingers fly fast
in the thunderdome, Barry.

94
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,282
Are we gonna do this or not?

95
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,923
Thank you. So we read each other's work
and meet again tomorrow?

96
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,653
Fine.

97
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,735
Nice try. This is blank paper.

98
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,396
And I'm sure it's still more valuable
than whatever's in here.

99
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,702
- Cough it up, Cooper.
- Very well.

100
00:06:56,716 --> 00:07:00,083
If this one's blank too,
I'm gonna be furious.

101
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,851
Fine.

102
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,267
Yo, always bet on black.

103
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,935
Get that waste of money out of my face.

104
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,806
It's only a waste of money
if we don't play with them.

105
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,069
He's right, dog.

106
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,842
Please, I'm working.

107
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,408
You know, there is a way we
can get action figures to look exactly like us.

108
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,053
Oh, yeah? How's that?

109
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:38,156
Two words: 3D printer.

110
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:41,383
But maybe it's three words.
No, hang on. Okay.

111
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:45,657
One word, a letter and a number,
and maybe a hyphen.

112
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,856
3D printer.

113
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,462
I have always wanted a 3D printer.

114
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,969
Of course you have.
They're an engineer's dream.

115
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,268
Anything you can design,
a 3D printer can make out of plastic.

116
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,638
Yeah, but they're so expensive.

117
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,439
Oh, come on, you deserve one.

118
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,606
You've worked hard to find a woman
who makes a lot of money.

119
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,177
Well, the prices have been coming down.

120
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:12,289
Oh, true.
They're practically giving them away.

121
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,450
You know, in exchange for money.

122
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,687
And we could make stuff we need
for work with it.

123
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:22,299
Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs,
specialized tools.

124
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:26,632
Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali
and his totally bitching dream house.

125
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,535
We don't need
Malibu Koothrappali's dream house.

126
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,305
Really, smart guy? Where is he supposed
to park his sweet little Corvette?

127
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:41,052
The monkey in my tobacco study
has taken to smoking a pipe.

128
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,518
I'm supposed to remove his brain
to examine...

129
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,853
...but it's hard, because now
he reminds me of my uncle.

130
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:53,023
You've been awfully quiet tonight.
Is everything okay?

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,365
I'm fine.

132
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,862
All right. Well, how was work today?

133
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,198
Did you exchange your research
with Kripke?

134
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,666
Yes.

135
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,444
Sheldon, what's going on?

136
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,577
I read his research and...

137
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,882
...it's leaps and bounds ahead of mine.

138
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:19,081
Which means the mommy
of the smartest physicist at the university...

139
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,852
...is not my mommy as I had thought.

140
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,091
It's his mommy.

141
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:30,202
Sheldon, I wish there was something
I could do to make you feel better.

142
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,572
May I offer you a consoling hug?

143
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,264
What do we have to lose?

144
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,606
How's that?

145
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,780
I feel like I'm being strangled
by a boa constrictor.

146
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,791
Why'd you stop?

147
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,195
Come on, Sheldon, we're gonna be late.

148
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,502
I can't go in today, I'm sick.

149
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,867
You're not sick.
You don't wanna face Kripke.

150
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,033
No. Look.

151
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,706
One hundred and 28.

152
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,375
See?

153
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:24,352
- What did you do? Put this in your tea?
- Oh, dear.

154
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:27,651
Now I'm not even smarter than you.

155
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:32,028
Sheldon, Kripke is not smarter than you.
You just got stuck on a wrong path.

156
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,793
Happened to Einstein. He got stuck
in the unified field theory for decades.

157
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,595
Oh, don't play the Einstein card.

158
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,261
His breakthroughs happened
when no one knew anything.

159
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,430
Everything was a great breakthrough.

160
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,801
Sheldon Lee Cooper,
I do not have time for this nonsense.

161
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,970
Go put your clothes on,
get in the car, and let's go to work.

162
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,884
All right, jeez.

163
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,277
What a grouch.

164
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,725
How did I do that?
I gotta remember how I did that.

165
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,063
Do you realize by owning a 3D printer...

166
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,791
...we are reclaiming
the manufacturing process...

167
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,903
...and taking jobs back
from sweatshops in China.

168
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:15,072
I think this thing was made in China.

169
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,072
Eh, what can you do?

170
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,503
Ooh, I think it's done.

171
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,611
It worked.

172
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,452
We printed a whistle.

173
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:29,914
Amazing.

174
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,183
You realize these things go
for 25 cents a pop at a party store.

175
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,486
And we made it in only three hours.

176
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,995
- Sounds just like store-bought.
- Heh, heh.

177
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,467
Okay, give me a superhero pose...

178
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:48,038
...and I will scan you into the computer
for your action figure.

179
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,839
Oh, I wish I was in better shape.

180
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:57,539
Stop holding your stomach in,
I'll give you a six-pack with the computer.

181
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,978
Oh, okay, great.

182
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,210
Now, I can look like Val Kilmer
as Batman...

183
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,049
...instead of Val Kilmer
as he looks today.

184
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,953
All right. You can suck it in a little bit.

185
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,193
Cooper, we have a problem.

186
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:18,325
Your work is really not
at the level I expected it to be.

187
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:21,697
I know. Go ahead and mock me.

188
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,536
But use small words so I understand.

189
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,874
Don't play dumb with me.
We both know what your problem is.

190
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,173
- We do?
- You have a girlfriend.

191
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,579
- So?
- So my work would suffer too...

192
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,882
...if I was getting laid all the time.

193
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,887
Yes.

194
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,292
That is the reason.

195
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,002
My work is suffering because of...

196
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,534
...all the laid I'm getting.

197
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,875
You lucky bastard.

198
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:04,842
What can I say?
You know, she enjoys my genitals.

199
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,411
I am giving them to her
on a nightly basis.

200
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,752
Okay, stop bragging.

201
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:16,361
You had some brilliant insights in here.
But if we'll make this work...

202
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,623
...you need to buckle down and focus.
- Yeah, I'll do what I can.

203
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,858
But it's not going to be easy
because when I'm with Amy...

204
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,232
...and our bathing suit areas
mush together...

205
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,902
...because it... Boy, howdy... . Is it magic.

206
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,541
Oh, good, you're home.

207
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,948
Got a little surprise for you.

208
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,178
Oh!

209
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:46,882
Say hello to my little friend.

210
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:53,459
Oh, my God, it's so cute.

211
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:57,466
I didn't think there could be
a smaller version of you.

212
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,128
I know, right?

213
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,969
And thanks to photographs
and a little 3D modeling...

214
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,509
...here comes the bride.

215
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,772
- Oh, Howie, I love these.
- I thought you might.

216
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,113
- Were they expensive?
- It didn't cost a thing. I made them myself.

217
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,617
- How?
- Koothrappali and I...

218
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:19,155
...bought a used 3D printer for $5000.

219
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,585
Heh, heh.

220
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,752
Five thousand dollars for a couple of dolls?
Are you out of your mind?

221
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,292
Not just a couple of dolls.

222
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,766
For as many dolls as we want.

223
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,429
And whistles.

224
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:39,676
At any point did it dawn on you to talk
to me about spending this kind of money?

225
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,773
It's kind of dawning on me now.

226
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,940
I don't believe you.

227
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,951
Howie, we can't afford to waste money
on junk like this.

228
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:52,613
What are you talking about?
We make plenty of money.

229
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,692
I make plenty of money.
You make peanuts.

230
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,160
Well, yes, but we're married now.

231
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,227
That means when you get sick,
I take care of you.

232
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:06,131
And when you make a bunch of money...

233
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,466
...I get to buy stuff.

234
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:14,711
Sorry if you don't like it,
but that's how love works.

235
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,680
No. Here's how love works.
You're gonna return the machine...

236
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:22,480
...or you could print out a working set
of lady parts and sleep with those.

237
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:27,086
Oh, my God.
Are you actually thinking about it?

238
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:34,057
I don't understand.
Why didn't you just tell Kripke the truth?

239
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,428
Because the truth made me look bad.

240
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,503
Whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie
makes me look good.

241
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,604
Anyway, if Kripke asks...

242
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:48,907
...tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent,
intense and whimsically inventive.

243
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,114
Is my coitus whimsically inventive?

244
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,349
That is what I write
on the bathroom walls.

245
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,154
"For a whimsically inventive time,
call Leonard Hofstadter."

246
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:09,092
I know you're joking,
but I'd be okay with that.

247
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,070
- Sheldon, can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

248
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,069
Are you ever gonna sleep with Amy?

249
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,636
- That's awfully personal.
- We don't ask Sheldon things like that.

250
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,872
Maybe you don't, I do. What's the deal?

251
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,745
Well, word around the university is...

252
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,013
...I'm giving her sex organs
a properjostling.

253
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,821
All right, come on, be serious.
You have been going out a long time.

254
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:37,086
She would clearly like
to have a physical relationship with you.

255
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,627
So, what are you doing?

256
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,891
All right, we're down the rabbit hole.
What are you doing?

257
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,495
Well, first of all, I'm quite fond of Amy.

258
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,968
Then what's the problem?

259
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,906
Penny...

260
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,442
...all my life I have been uncomfortable...

261
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:56,103
...with the sort of physical contact
that comes easily to others...

262
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,647
...handshaking, hugging...

263
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,682
...prostate exams.

264
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,090
But I'm working on it, you know?

265
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:11,093
Just recently, I had to put VapoRub
on Amy's chest.

266
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,993
A year ago,
that would have been unthinkable.

267
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,363
Now you know how I feel
when I have to put it on you.

268
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,797
Okay, hang on.

269
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,703
Are you saying
someday you and Amy might...

270
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,936
...actually get physical?

271
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,273
It's a possibility.

272
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,850
Oh, my God.

273
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,391
Sheldon, I know this wasn't easy
and I'm glad we can have this conversation.

274
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,999
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

275
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,405
Sure you wanna do this?

276
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,842
- Give up your half of the 3D printer?
- Yes.

277
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,244
And can you please make that out
to Bernadette?

278
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,580
I was taken off the joint account
until I learn the value of money.

279
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,246
Well, that's harsh.

280
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,255
Tell me about it.

281
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,558
Aren't you gonna eat lunch?

282
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:20,255
No, I blew my food allowance
on Pokemon cards.

283
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:28,201
Well, the equation balances,
but it's certainly not elegant.

284
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,739
Whatever. You get any last night?

285
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,370
Yes.

286
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,714
Gave it to her good, huh?

287
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,343
No, I gave it to her well.

288
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,222
Now, over here I was thinking...

289
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,052
...turbulence could be reduced if we put...
- Yeah, yeah.

290
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,958
Was she naked,
or was she wearing lingerie?

291
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,626
I didn't notice.

292
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,127
How could you not notice?

293
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:03,764
I was too busy squishing
all the desirable parts of her body.

294
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:07,002
Oh, you're killing me, Cooper!

295
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,307
Can we get back to work?

296
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,506
Sure, sure, sure.

297
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,608
You guys ever used any toys?

298
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,582
Toys?

299
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,123
I do have a model rocket next to my bed.

300
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,321
A rocket? You're a freak. I love it.
