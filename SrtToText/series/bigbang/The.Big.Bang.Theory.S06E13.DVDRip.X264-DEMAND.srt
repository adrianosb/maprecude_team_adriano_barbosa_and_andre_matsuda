1
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:05,534
Hey, will you steam my uniform next?

2
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:08,537
Interesting.
Do you recall this conversation?

3
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:11,108
"Leonard, wanna go halfsies
on a steamer?"

4
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,904
"No, Sheldon, we don't need a steamer."

5
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,078
Looks like that rumpled
chicken's come home to roost.

6
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,212
Hi. Here are the makeup
sponges you asked for.

7
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,015
- Oh, thanks, I thought I had more.
- Hmm.

8
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,360
Damn, you've got more makeup than I do.

9
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:34,055
You've got better makeup than I do.
Yeah, I'm borrowing this.

10
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,395
Hey, hey, hey,
this is my Comic-Con makeup.

11
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:41,370
I love you, but there are some things
a man doesn't share with his girlfriend.

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,737
That's a wise policy.

13
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:46,707
I once borrowed my sister's makeup
for a costume contest...

14
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,608
...got a terrible case of pink eye.

15
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:52,249
Yeah, well, luckily, I was going
as a zombie, I won second place.

16
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,280
You guys just went to Comic-Con.

17
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:58,457
That was San Diego Comic-Con.
This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.

18
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,386
- Is that better?
- Well, it's a lot smaller.

19
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:02,856
It's about the comic books.

20
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,998
The way these conventions used to be
before they went Hollywood.

21
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,666
So to answer your question,
no, it's not better.

22
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,296
Then why are you going?

23
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,463
It's a comic book convention.

24
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,573
Like pizza or particle accelerators...

25
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:18,005
...even the stinky ones, still pretty good.

26
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,403
Well, you guys have fun.
I guess I'll see you Sunday.

27
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,775
- Yeah. Oh, hang on a second.
- Okay.

28
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,814
Hold this.

29
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,987
- What was that for?
- To show people when they don't believe me.

30
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:06,117
This is the best. You have booze with
breakfast on Tuesday, you got a problem.

31
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,691
You do it on the weekend,
you got brunch.

32
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,856
Sheldon doesn't believe in brunch.

33
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:15,626
Can't stand a table where one person's having
an omelet and another is having a sandwich.

34
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,994
That's not exhausting at all.

35
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:22,966
Oh.

36
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:27,637
It's Leonard. He says they're on the road
and headed for Bakersfield at warp speed.

37
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,140
Maybe it's the mimosa,
but I'm gonna give the kid an LOL.

38
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,450
Cute how excited they are.

39
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,384
You should have seen Howard
sewing his costume all week.

40
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,323
When did Howard learn to sew?

41
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:43,620
When he was a little boy, every couple of
months he'd have to let his mom's pants out.

42
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,266
I don't understand
why they go to these conventions.

43
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,563
The four of them work at a major university,
they're all smart...

44
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:55,138
...how can they be into something
for 12-year-olds?

45
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,141
I don't mind it. I think Howie's
just in touch with his inner child.

46
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,176
Although when he's in Batman pajamas...

47
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,440
...sometimes it feels like
I'm touching his inner child.

48
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,851
It's probably because they were bullied.
In a world where you can't fight back...

49
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,149
...superheroes provide
meaningful wish-fulfillment.

50
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:16,989
Hmm. Now I feel bad for picking on
all those kids.

51
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,189
Although if Danny Biffle
didn't want to eat a mouthful of dirt...

52
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,095
...he shouldn't have shown up
to school wearing a bow tie.

53
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,665
I've never even read a comic book.
You guys?

54
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,863
Mm-mm.
- No.

55
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,009
It's such an important part of their lives.

56
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,111
- Maybe we should try reading some.
- Seriously?

57
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,173
The comic book store isn't far from here.

58
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,976
That is an amazing idea.

59
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,210
Okay, how many of these have I had?

60
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,527
I think you should turn on the GPS.

61
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,821
It is on.

62
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,464
But the turn-by-turn voice option isn't on.

63
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,965
I know I'd feel more safe
if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option.

64
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,400
I love the turn-by-turn voice option.

65
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,207
Has it really only been 10 miles?

66
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,976
I'm turning it on, but just to shut you up.

67
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:13,151
Leonard,
bear left and continue on Interstate 210.

68
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,216
Ooh, sounds like that fellow
knows what he's talking about.

69
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,222
I'd put on my listening ears if I were you.

70
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,721
- What did you do?
- I found a hack online.

71
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,731
I was able to upload MP3 recordings
of my voice to your GPS.

72
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,927
- That is so cool.
- Counterpoint, no, it's not.

73
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:37,738
Continue on Interstate 210 for five miles.

74
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,742
Here's an interesting fact
about Interstates:

75
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,945
- Really?
- Shh!

76
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,277
He said it's interesting.

77
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,082
Interstates are numbered as follows:

78
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,020
Even-numbered routes run east and west.

79
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:57,188
Odd-numbered routes run
north and south.

80
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:03,058
Three-digit route numbers
indicate bypasses or spurs.

81
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,099
Look, Leonard, there's a bridge.
Drive off it.

82
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,666
You know, we're not that far
from Vasquez Rocks.

83
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,938
Oh, they shot a lot of
Star Trek episodes out there.

84
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,115
We got our costumes in the trunk...

85
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,683
...we could go there
and have a little photo shoot.

86
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:23,413
Great idea. I haven't had
a carbohydrate in two weeks.

87
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:27,753
These cheekbones need to be in front of a
camera before I eat a pretzel and they're gone.

88
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,456
- It sounds fun.
- Oh, smashing.

89
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,962
Now, Leonard,
do you know how to get there?

90
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,067
- No.
- Yeah, well, luckily, someone in the car does.

91
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,295
Recalculating.

92
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,474
While we're waiting,
do you know which president...

93
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,976
...signed the
Interstate Highway System Act into law?

94
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:51,809
The answer coming up in 14 miles.

95
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:56,619
None of you will get it. It's Eisenhower.

96
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,127
Why are they staring?

97
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,300
Who cares, just soak it in.

98
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,140
Hello, boys.

99
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,305
Oh, hey.

100
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,549
Could you please stop staring?
They're just girls.

101
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,245
It's nothing you haven't seen
in movies or in drawings.

102
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,692
- Hey, Stuart.
- What brings you guys here?

103
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,488
We were looking for a recommendation
about comic books.

104
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,962
Well, I recommend you don't
open a store and sell them.

105
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:45,003
We were wondering why the guys
like this stuff, so we thought we'd try it.

106
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,331
Oh, okay.
What do you think you might be into?

107
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,008
Superhero? Fantasy?
Graphic novels? Manga?

108
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,871
I swear I will turn a hose on you.

109
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,881
What kind of comics do the guys like?

110
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:03,385
Um, a little bit of everything.
Mostly superhero stuff.

111
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,683
- All right, well, who's the best superhero?
- Shh!

112
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:10,590
You can't ask a question like that in here.
Are you trying to start a rumble?

113
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,893
Well, what do you recommend?

114
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,297
Well, uh, let's see, you've got your basic
clean-cut good guys:

115
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,165
Superman, Spider-Man, Captain America.

116
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,341
Then you have your darker anti-heroes:

117
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,567
Your Batman, your Wolverine, Punisher.

118
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,802
Ooh, I do love a bad boy.

119
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,807
As evidenced by your boyfriend
and his fear of hamsters.

120
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,715
If I were you,
I'd go for Fables number one.

121
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,414
Artwork is sophisticated,
it's intelligently written...

122
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,024
...and it doesn't objectify...

123
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:44,095
...or stereotype women.
- Oh, Thor. He's hot.

124
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,626
Yeah, he kind of is.

125
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,439
And we're blending...

126
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,098
...and we're blending, and we're done.

127
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:07,351
I know Mr. Data isn't supposed
to smile, but here it comes.

128
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,291
Come on, guys, let's do this.

129
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,723
Yeah, I'm sweating my bald cap off.

130
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,634
What's our first pose gonna be?

131
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,360
I say we begin with a classic
Star Trek fight scene.

132
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,163
I'll set the timer.

133
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,147
Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?

134
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,941
Mr. Data's weapon is his mind.

135
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,242
I'm wielding it.

136
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,091
Phasers on the Borg!

137
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,927
Charlie's Angels!

138
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,693
Okay, what's next?

139
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,702
Now let's do some sexy glamour shots.

140
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,704
I'll set the mood.

141
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,550
Yeah, nice one.

142
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:16,845
That's right.

143
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,191
Oh, my God.
Leonard, someone's stealing your car!

144
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,295
What? Hey! Hey, come back here!

145
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,729
- Stop!
- Stealing is against the law!

146
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,534
I don't believe this.

147
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,171
Son of a bitch.

148
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,204
I'll call 911.

149
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,140
Oh, no, my phone is in my other pants.

150
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,869
- Mine too.
- So is mine.

151
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,445
Anybody got any ideas?

152
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:46,516
Nope. The only thing left to do now
is assign blame.

153
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,584
Nice going.

154
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,389
What kind of a person steals
another person's car in broad daylight?

155
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,964
What kind of person
leaves his keys in the car?

156
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,192
Thought we agreed
it's Koothrappali's fault.

157
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,494
You're right.

158
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,929
Nice going.

159
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,598
Car.

160
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,275
What is wrong with people?
Why don't they stop?

161
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,816
Maybe we're better off.

162
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,715
What if we were to get in a car
with a crazy person?

163
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,617
Look at us, Sheldon.
We're the crazy people.

164
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,458
Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign...

165
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:35,293
...that assures passing motorists
of our mental competence.

166
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,332
Good idea.
Why don't you get started on that?

167
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,565
Come on, let's just start walking.

168
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,709
There's gotta be a gas station
or something nearby.

169
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:49,676
What, you think just because you're wearing
a captain's uniform you're in charge?

170
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,674
Yes.

171
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,841
All right.

172
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,028
Okay, I'm done.

173
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,328
- How did you guys finish so fast?
- I don't know, there were a lot of pictures.

174
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:13,733
And one page only had the word
"brakka-dooom!"

175
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,509
Yeah, well, I have street smarts.

176
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:20,672
So, what'd you guys think?

177
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,842
- Well, there was a lot of action.
- Hmm.

178
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,416
And the story moved along
at a brisk pace.

179
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:30,111
It was, overall,
what's the word I'm looking for?

180
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,584
- Stupid?
- So stupid.

181
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,019
I don't know how Leonard
can get so caught up.

182
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,560
It's crazy. They spend hours arguing
about things that don't even exist.

183
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,130
- What a waste of time.
- I know.

184
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,596
A hammer so heavy
that no one else can pick it up?

185
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:49,534
I don't think it's heavy, I think it's some
sort of magic so only Thor can lift it.

186
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,937
That makes even less sense, I mean...

187
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:55,409
No, no, no, it doesn't.

188
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,509
Thor is a god. The hammer is his.
Only he can use it.

189
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,552
It's like Sheldon and his toothbrush.

190
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,221
Or his thin, beckoning lips.

191
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,224
Okay, hang on, what if Thor's hand
is on the hammer?

192
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,921
If he's touching it with his god magic,
then does that mean I could lift it?

193
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,760
- No.
- Yes.

194
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,634
Well, which is it?

195
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:22,172
- Maybe we missed something.
- Let's read it again.

196
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,035
- Okay.
- Yeah.

197
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,446
- You want some tea?
- Good idea. I'll help you.

198
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:37,121
- Wait, I thought we were reading?
- We are.

199
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,918
We're just, uh, giving you a head start.

200
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,295
I wish my mom was here.

201
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,501
We could all hang out in her shadow.

202
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,436
Wool pants in the desert.

203
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,478
I feel like I've got poached testicles.

204
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,614
Oh, you poor thing, you're sweating.

205
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,310
That's so much worse
than having your car stolen.

206
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:14,289
Insurance is gonna buy you a new car.
It's not gonna de-funk my junk.

207
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:18,626
Gentlemen, a little less bellyaching.

208
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:22,289
We're Starfleet officers
and a member of the Borg Collective.

209
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,299
Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood.

210
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,096
Leonard...

211
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,332
...all our lives
we have dreamed of finding ourselves...

212
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,977
...inside one of the fantasy worlds
we love.

213
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,003
And look at us.

214
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,980
At this moment, we are, in fact,
a Star Trek landing party...

215
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,677
...stranded in an alien
and unforgiving environment.

216
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:47,181
Relying only on our wits,
our fortitude and our moxie.

217
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,661
As long as we have those things...

218
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,659
- ...nothing can stop us...
- Nerds!

219
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,670
I hate this planet.

220
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,372
It says right here on the hammer:

221
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,676
"Whoever holds this hammer, if he be
worthy, shall possess the power of Thor."

222
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,682
Hold on. Who decides who's worthy?
Does the hammer decide?

223
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,514
- Yes!
- No!

224
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:22,057
- It can't decide, it's a hammer.
- You said it's a magic hammer!

225
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,024
Yeah, but it can't make decisions.

226
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,290
If Harry Potter's wand can make decisions,
why can't Thor's hammer?

227
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:32,869
Okay, if you're gonna start comparing wands
and hammers, I can't even take you seriously.

228
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,381
Hello.

229
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,226
Hello.

230
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,727
Four glasses of water, please.

231
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,567
Anything for you guys?

232
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,938
Can I use your phone?
Our car got stolen.

233
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,107
Why don't you ask Scotty
to beam you up?

234
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:17,480
Scotty was on the original series
and we're Next Generation.

235
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,781
So joke's on you.

236
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,284
We're not with him.

237
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,525
You can't pick something up
in outer space.

238
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,233
In space, there is no up.

239
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,494
Oh, yeah? Then how does
the sun come up every day?

240
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,838
Hard to argue
with those kind of street smarts.

241
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,480
Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics.
Why don't we go look at those?

242
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,346
Oh, great. And then you will see,
I am not wrong.

243
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,386
If we were in outer space,
anyone could pick up the hammer...

244
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,353
...because it would be floating
in a weightless environment.

245
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,824
Yeah, that's right,
the slow reader used science. Suck on that.

246
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:11,628
- Was there anything valuable in the car?
- Our clothes, our wallets, phones.

247
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,361
And about $300 worth of makeup...

248
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,632
...so this thief could look like
anyone right now.

249
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,804
Makeup? Sure.

250
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:28,177
We're going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield.
They have a big costume contest.

251
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,548
It's cooler than it sounds.

252
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,223
I don't know, sounds pretty cool.

253
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,723
It is. It's not just comic books.

254
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,161
They've got action figures,
toys, a Tron themed dance party...

255
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,198
Okay, he gets how cool it is.

256
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,331
I think I have all I need here.
You guys need me to call someone?

257
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,905
I'm guessing your moms?

258
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,171
Thanks, but we've got it covered.

259
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,871
Okay, I just talked to my mom.

260
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,351
She arranged for us to get a rental car.

261
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,455
Great, we can still make it to Comic-Con.

262
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,058
Are you kidding me? After all we've
been through? I just want to go home.

263
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:12,355
Don't be like that.
Come on, Howard, talk to him.

264
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,328
I'm with Leonard. I'm done.

265
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:19,402
Fine, then I guess it's two against two.
How do we decide?

266
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,232
Actually, it's three against one.

267
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:27,542
What? Well, what about the mission?
You said we're a real-life landing party.

268
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,338
Well, we're not.

269
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,039
We're an imaginary landing party.

270
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:37,154
Who had real-life garbage thrown at us
by real-life strangers who think we're idiots.

271
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,618
And to tell you the truth,
I'm starting to feel like one.

272
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,361
I want to go home now.

273
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,296
Okay.

274
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,732
Did we at least rent the car
from Enterprise?

275
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,773
Get it? Enterprise? Heh.

276
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,641
Screw you, that's funny.

277
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:05,314
Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor
while Thor is holding the hammer?

278
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,684
- Yeah?
- Then by the transitive property...

279
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,787
...of picking things up,
Hulk picked up the hammer.

280
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,322
No, Hulk picked up Thor,
Thor picked up the hammer.

281
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,928
Hang on, if I go to a bar and pick
up a guy, and he picks up a girl...

282
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,929
...and then we all leave together,
did I pick up the girl?

283
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,305
Did that ever happen?

284
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,769
Hey, we talking about me
or are we talking about Thor?

285
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,987
Well, I say that's the last time
we ever go outside.

286
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,690
Look right here,
Red Hulk is picking up Thor's hammer...

287
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,359
...because Thor is touching it.

288
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,926
No, it's because they're in space!

289
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,826
- He's touching the strap.
- The strap is part of the hammer!

290
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,693
No, it's not!

291
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,299
Are they actually
arguing about comic books?

292
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,938
No, that can't be right.

293
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,338
Maybe Thor's Hammer
is a new color of nail polish.

294
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,312
Then Red Hulk must be worthy!

295
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,311
How could Red Hulk be worthy?

296
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,484
You don't know his life.

297
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,719
There's only one logical explanation:
Somewhere in the desert...

298
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,393
...we crossed into
an alternate dimension...

299
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:27,696
...where the women in our lives
can finally appreciate great literature.

300
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,163
If it's an alternate dimension...

301
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,703
...that sounds like ajob
for a landing party.

302
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,539
Captain, what are your orders?

303
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,083
I say we investigate.

304
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,345
Wait.

305
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,516
They might be hostile.

306
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,026
Fine, but set them to stun.
