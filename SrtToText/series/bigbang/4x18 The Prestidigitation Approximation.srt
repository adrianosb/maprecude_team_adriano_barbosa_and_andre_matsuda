00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:09,092
Yes. There, I said it.

316
00:18:10,903 --> 00:18:11,927
Okay, look.

317
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:14,800
- I happen to like your girlfriend.
- And she likes you.

318
00:18:14,973 --> 00:18:17,237
- No, she doesn't.
- Not really, no.

319
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:20,708
It doesn't matter. From now on,
I will keep my distance from you.

320
00:18:20,879 --> 00:18:23,541
Hold on. What kind of
distance are we talking about?

321
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:24,909
Because we are neighbors.

322
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,177
I mean, I can hear the toilet flush
in your apartment.

323
00:18:28,353 --> 00:18:31,083
- You can hear my toilet flush?
- I don't listen for it...

324
00:18:31,256 --> 00:18:34,987
...but it's nice to know
everything's okay with your plumbing.

325
00:18:35,894 --> 00:18:37,885
The building's plumbing.

326
00:18:38,063 --> 00:18:40,759
Leonard, I get it.
You're in a new relationship.

327
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:43,868
I'm happy for you. Why don't we
shake hands and part friends?

328
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:45,435
Well, now hold on.

329
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:46,730
How about this?

330
00:18:46,905 --> 00:18:49,874
How about we still hang out,
but on the down low?

331
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,537
- Are you really that kind of guy?
- No.

332
00:18:55,714 --> 00:18:59,150
I actually felt kind of silly
just saying "on the down low."

333
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:02,720
Goodbye, Leonard.

334
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:08,423
Penny, wait.

335
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:16,857
Damn contacts.

336
00:19:21,673 --> 00:19:23,573
Incoming.

337
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,568
- Hi.
- Hey.

338
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:28,576
Hello.

339
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:31,242
Why so glum, chum?

340
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,283
Apparently, you can't hack
into a government supercomputer...

341
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:37,081
...and then try to buy uranium...

342
00:19:37,255 --> 00:19:41,817
...without the Department of Homeland
Security tattling to your mother.

343
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:48,833
Oh, that's too bad.
Figure out the magic trick yet?

344
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:51,128
[MOCKINGLY]
"Figure out the magic trick yet?"

345
00:19:52,137 --> 00:19:54,162
- Want me to tell you how to do it?
- No.

346
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:55,863
I'll show you one more time.

347
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,135
- Raj?
- Hang on.

348
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:04,148
This time do it with me, so I can
make sure there's no monkey business.

349
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:07,476
All right.

350
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,295
- Two of hearts.
- I hate you.
