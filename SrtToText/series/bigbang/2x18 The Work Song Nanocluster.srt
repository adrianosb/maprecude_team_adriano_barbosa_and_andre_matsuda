00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:46,332
Actually, I'm thinking
about this one stripper named Vega.

156
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:52,069
But, sure, calcium sulfate could work.

157
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,170
Let's think out of the box for a moment.

158

HOWARD AND LEONARD:
Oh.

160

in the kitchen.

161

Wow.

162
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,192
Hey, we could liberate some
microporous charcoal from the chem lab.

163

Oh, great.

Raj, why don't you go get the charcoal?

165
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:19,533
Leonard, start working
on some preliminary website designs.

166
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:23,263
I'll make space in our apartment so we
can move the manufacturing process.

167
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:27,432
- Well, what's wrong with my apartment?
- It's not my apartment.

will give the general idea of the website.

So, what do you guys think?

No, pretty much any way I say

the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.

No, it doesn't.

Please. <i>Dateline</i> could use it
to attract predators.

182

Penny, this is your enterprise,
so it's ultimately your decision.

183
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:34,908
But based on the quality of his work,
I'd strongly recommend...

184
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:37,068
...that we let Leonard go.

185
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:38,878
You wanna fire me?

186
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:42,575
What I want is irrelevant.
This is Penny's decision.

Penny?

188

Excuse me, if I did such a bad job,
then why do we already have orders?

- Uh-huh. Look.

190
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,987
Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville, Alabama
has ordered two.

191

PENNY: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

with Bluetooth.
