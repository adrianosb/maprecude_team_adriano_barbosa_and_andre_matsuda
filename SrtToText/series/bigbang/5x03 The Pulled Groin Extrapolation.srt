1
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:05,212
- Who wants the last dumpling?
- Ooh, me.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,297
Penny, a moment.

3
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:09,550
We just had Thai food.

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,512
In that culture, the last morsel
is called the krengjai piece.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,601
And it is reserved for the most important
and valued member of the group.

6
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,401
Thank you all for this high honor.

7
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,364
I've seen pictures of your mother.
Keep eating.

8
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:40,789
All right, honey, if we're gonna
make the movie, we should go.

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,961
This may be hard for you to hear...

10
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,964
...but when I say "honey,"
I mean my fiancée.

11
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,802
Yeah, well, now it means her.

12
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,723
It's okay if he wants to come.

13
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,142
Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.

14
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,563
- I gotta to work. I'll walk down with you.
- Wait.

15
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,941
Uh, which is closer
to the new train store in Monrovia?

16
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,194
The movie theater
or The Cheesecake Factory?

17
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,321
Neither of them are close.

18
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,157
I guess it doesn't matter
which one of you drives me.

19
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,410
Let's play a fun guessing game
to see who gets to take me.

20
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:23,290
All right. This four-letter word
describes either a printer's type size...

21
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,626
...or a compulsion to eat dirt.

22
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:30,506
- Okay, I'm not driving him.
- Penny, don't give up, you can get this.

23
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,594
Aren't you going with Sheldon?

24
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,765
No, I have no interest in model trains,
stores that sell them...

25
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,476
...nor their heart-breaking clientele.

26
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:47,022
Oh, well, I have some work to do,
so...

27
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,067
I can't imagine that would disturb me.
Carry on.

28
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:55,572
Okay. Wouldn't you be
more comfortable at home?

29
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,745
Not really, no.

30
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,250
Alrighty then.
I guess I'll just get started.

31
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,502
Please, I don't need
the running commentary.

32
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,132
- Amy?
- Yo.

33
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,969
- You okay?
- Oh, sure.

34
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,974
- I thought you were reading.
- I was.

35
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,560
Now I'm thinking about what I read.

36
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,534
You all right, Leonard?
You seem very uncomfortable.

37
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,245
I... I'm fine.

38
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,497
Should I go?

39
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,000
I've been told sometimes
I overstay my welcome.

40
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,212
What...? Who told you that?

41
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,466
Well, most recently, my gynecologist.

42
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,265
Oh, you stay as long as you'd like.

43
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,686
I'm glad to hear you say that
because I'm having a wonderful time.

44
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,982
Hmm. I said the same thing
to my gynecologist.

45
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,657
What are you gonna get
at the train store, Sheldon?

46
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,450
Oh, I'm not buying anything.

47
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,452
They're having a lecture.

48
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,579
"HO gage railroading.

49
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,208
Half the size of O gage,
but twice the fun."

50
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,586
It's a very controversial topic.

51
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,340
- Which side do you come down on?
- I'll let you know after tonight.

52
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,301
Unlike some people,
I'm going in with an open mind.

53
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,262
Who am I kidding?

54
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,431
Of course we all know
it's O gage or no gage.

55
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:30,519
Can you believe grown men
sit around and play with toy trains? Heh.

56
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,271
That's big talk...

57
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,899
...for a man with a closet full
of magic tricks at his mother's house.

58
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,113
First of all, they're not tricks.
They're illusions.

59
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,200
Secondly, when we get married,
they're all going up in the attic...

60
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,619
...so you can have that closet
for clothes.

61
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,622
Why would I keep clothes
at your mother's house?

62
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,165
Well, don't think of it that way.

63
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,376
Once we move in, it'll be our house.

64
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,919
Is she moving out?

65
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,880
Why would she move out?
It's her house.

66
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,927
Hang on. You seriously think
I'm gonna live with your mother?

67
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,804
Howard, I think I can help here.

68
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,099
Yes, Bernadette,
that's exactly what he thinks.

69
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,144
Why not?
It's a great house, plenty of room.

70
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,273
If we have kids, Mom's there to help.
When she tells "The Three Little Pigs"...

71
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,734
...she actually has hair
on her chinny chin chin.

72
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:25,157
I'm not gonna live with your mother.
Not now, not ever.

73
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,618
Wow, someone obviously has
some mommy issues.

74
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,372
Raj, take me home.

75
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,875
Don't listen to her.
Go to the movie theater.

76
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,169
- Take me home now.
- Movie theater.

77
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:42,382
Okay, everybody, calm down.
There is a simple solution here.

78
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,217
Raj, take me to the train store...

79
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,137
...and then I don't care
what you people do.

80
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,270
How was your shower?

81
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,106
Good, good.

82
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,860
Just out of curiosity,
what time do you usually go to bed?

83
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,821
Oh, I'm up all night.
I'm like a possum.

84
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,701
Boy, you were not liked in high school,
were you?

85
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,121
- Not really. Is that my yearbook?
- Mm-hm.

86
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,332
"Dear Leonard,
you're really good at science.

87
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,960
Maybe one day you'll come up
with a cure for being a dork."

88
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,381
It wasn't spray-painting
a lightning bolt on my briefcase.

89
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,967
- I can tell you that.
- If it makes you feel any better...

90
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,303
...the only person who signed
my yearbook was my mother.

91
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,471
Aw.

92
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,975
"Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are
better than friends and fun. Love, Mom."

93
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:40,065
Well, you can add Jerry's Junction
to the list of train stores...

94
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,402
...Sheldon Cooper
will never set foot in again.

95
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:48,031
- Rough night, Casey Jones?
- You don't know the half of it.

96
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,160
It was billed as a lively give-and-take
on the merits of model-train sizes.

97
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,829
But it was actually a set-up...

98
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:58,333
...to intimidate weak-minded, spineless
rubes into buying HO starter sets.

99
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,711
- What's in the bag?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

100
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,799
But it's not a spine, I'll tell you that.

101
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,845
I had a delightful evening.
We should do this again sometime.

102
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,805
Uh, sure. That'd be nice.

103
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,641
Glad to hear it. I need someone
to accompany me to the wedding...

104
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,185
...of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson
this Friday.

105
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:20,564
They're kind of the Brad and Angelina
of the Primatology Department.

106
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,150
- Wouldn't you rather bring Sheldon?
- I would...

107
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,694
...but the last wedding we went to
was a disaster.

108
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,905
- He behaved like a child the entire time.
- It's not my fault.

109
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,409
You said there'd be other scientists there
my age.

110
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,873
Doesn't matter. You're out. He's in.

111
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,125
No date to the prom,
two dates to a wedding.

112
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,586
Hmm, how times change.

113
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,217
Ha, ha, you have to go to a wedding.

114
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,307
I'll get it.

115
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,934
- Could you get it?
- I said I'm getting it!

116
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,354
- Fine, I'll get it.
- I got it!

117
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,608
Oh, hi.

118
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,026
Hey.

119
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,360
I don't wanna fight.

120
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,364
I was just surprised when you sprung
the living-with-your-mom stuff on me.

121
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,827
Yeah, well,
I'm sorry I didn't run it by you first.

122
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,622
I don't know
who you're talking to, but in or out!

123
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,333
We don't need bugs!

124
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,211
The bugs only come here...

125
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,172
...because you're their queen!

126
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,510
Listen, how about this?

127
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:35,222
Before we make any decision
about where we live, we have a trial run.

128
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,974
You know, stay here for a weekend,
see what it's like.

129
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,644
- Your mom would be okay with that?
- Sure, she would.

130
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,438
Ma, do you mind if Bernadette
stays here this weekend?

131
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,316
Hey, if she's
willing to give the milk away for free...

132
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,902
...who am I to say no?

133
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,239
See? She's good with it.

134
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,619
Frankly, after all
your sleepovers with the little brown boy...

135
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,497
...a girl is a big relief.

136
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,009
All these years, I've been so wrong.

137
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:17,931
The tinier the train,
the more concentrated the fun.

138
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,852
You're a brain scientist.

139
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,314
Can you explain why a brilliant man
likes playing with toy trains?

140
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,817
Not without cutting his head open, no.

141
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,821
How about making my eyes
like Cleopatra?

142
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,781
Really? For a wedding?

143
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,450
You're right.
My cheek bones and beckoning pelvis...

144
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,245
...already have a certain
"Hello, sailor" quality.

145
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,164
I'm ready.

146
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,958
Aw.

147
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,544
So handsome.

148
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,837
Like James Bond.

149
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,550
Better than James Bond
because he's tinier.

150
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,053
I got you this to give to me.

151
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,766
Oh, sweetie, guests don't normally
wear corsages to a wedding.

152
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,310
That's more of a prom thing.

153
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,644
I never went to my prom.

154
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:09,024
My mom paid my cousin to take me
but he just used the money to buy drugs.

155
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,860
Put the corsage on her.

156
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,282
Amy, this is for you, heh.

157
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,661
When you're done copping a feel,
that goes on my wrist.

158
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:28,043
All aboard. Woo-woo!

159
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:33,256
It's official. I'm an HO trainiac.

160
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,553
So dinner went nice.

161
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,555
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

162
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,684
Does your mother always cut your meat
for you?

163
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,480
Only when it's fatty.

164
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,566
Well, don't be jealous, babe.

165
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,943
Someday, you'll get to cut it for me.

166
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,031
Bernadette,
I found the extra head for the Water Pik...

167
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,699
...if you wanna use it.

168
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,035
I'm okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.

169
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:06,706
You sure? I just squirted
half a brisket out of my teeth.

170
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,459
Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?

171
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:13,797
Oh, I know what that means. Hubba-hubba.

172
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:18,176
- Oh, God.
- Relax, it'll be fine.

173
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,678
- Okay.
- Heh.

174
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,222
Let me know when you're done canoodling.

175
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,641
Mommy needs a foot rub.

176
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,605
Do a little dance

177
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,399
Make a little love

178
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:36,277
Get down tonight

179
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,780
Do a little dance

180
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,448
Make a little love

181
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,783
Get down tonight

182
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,243
Would you like to dance?

183
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,663
No, thank you.
I'm really not much of a dancer.

184
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:51,584
You're not exactly winning any trophies
as a conversationalist, either.

185
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,966
I'm sorry.
The bride and groom seem happy.

186
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,136
Why shouldn't they be?
They have a feverish night...

187
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,305
...of socially-approved copulation
ahead of them.

188
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,017
In some cultures,
we'd stand outside their room...

189
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,395
...cheering as they achieved orgasm.

190
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,983
That sounds like a late night,
and I have work in the morning, so...

191
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,571
Leonard, you may not have noticed,
but I am being a delight here.

192
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,324
You're not holding up your end
of the evening.

193
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,994
I'm sorry.
This wedding just reminds me...

194
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,456
...of my kind-of-sort-of girlfriend
9000 miles away.

195
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,417
I have a kind-of-sort-of boyfriend
playing with a model train right now.

196
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,003
You don't hear me bitching about it.

197
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,718
A word of advice.
Moody self-obsession is only attractive...

198
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,305
...in men who can play guitar
and are considerably taller than you.

199
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,308
I'm not moody, I'm fun.

200
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,186
Do you have any evidence
to support that statement?

201
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,063
Well, hey,
I'm just as much fun as you are.

202
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,441
Really?
Are you willing to draw a mustache...

203
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,402
...on your finger
as a conversational icebreaker?

204
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,321
I am.

205
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,910
Okay, fine. What do you suggest?

206
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,538
We just had a lovely meal.

207
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:14,167
The band is on fire.

208
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,046
And you're sitting next to a beautiful
woman wearing whorish makeup.

209
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,591
Why don't we head out on the floor...

210
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,427
...and see if I can sweat
through these dress shields?

211
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,388
Once again,
I'm really not much of a dancer.

212
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:31,100
Don't worry, I'll lead.

213
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,175
Howard?

214
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,639
- Ready for bed?
- No. I need to brush my teeth...

215
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,559
...but your mother's been
in the bathroom for an hour.

216
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,436
Oh, yeah, she sometimes
has problems doing her business.

217
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,980
Hang on, ahem.

218
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,439
Ma, give up!

219
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,234
Tonight's not your night!

220
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,654
You don't know that, I just sat down!

221
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,447
Come on, take a break.

222
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,700
Bernadette needs to brush her teeth.

223
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,662
She can come in
and brush her teeth. I'm not embarrassed.

224
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,331
Problem solved.

225
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,086
No, it's not. I'm not going in there.

226
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,673
Oh, come on, honey. She's just
sitting in there reading a magazine.

227
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,426
You can't see anything.
I go in all the time.

228
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,347
Ha! The eagle has landed.

229
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,145
And we have splash down.

230
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,150
Wait here.
I'm gonna go light a candle.

231
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,653
And then we make passionate love.

232
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,622
- There we go, last floor.
- I just can't figure out what happened.

233
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,207
I put my left leg in,
I took my left leg out.

234
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:22,378
I put my left leg in,
and something just snapped.

235
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,381
The Hokey-Pokey
is a young man's game.

236
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,009
I did have a great time.

237
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,596
Thank you for reminding me
it's okay to have fun once in a while.

238
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,181
You're welcome.

239
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,224
Also for breaking the head
off the ice swan...

240
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,186
...so I could hold it
against my pulled groin.

241
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,688
I excel at spatial reasoning,
and I had a hunch...

242
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:44,359
...that the graceful slope of its neck
would cradle your genitals nicely.

243
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,863
Well, okay. Again, thank you.

244
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,449
And again, you're welcome.

245
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,537
- Wanna come in, have a cup of tea?
- No, I'm gonna head home.

246
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,706
Okay, well, good night.

247
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,416
Good night.

248
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,676
Ames, hi. How was the wedding?

249
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:13,972
Great. Until I accidentally made
Leonard fall in love with me.

250
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,811
Come in, let's talk.

251
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,313
Do you want a glass of wine?

252
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,565
Wine is one of the reasons
I'm in this fix.

253
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,067
That and this dang pelvis.

254
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,030
Okay, I'm sorry,
what exactly happened?

255
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,784
The inevitable. He was lonely and
vulnerable from missing his girlfriend.

256
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,370
While I was charming, supportive,
and let's face it...

257
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:41,165
...in this dress, the perfect combination
of Madonna and whore.

258
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:46,254
- Oh, God, did he make a move on you?
- No, but it's only a matter of time.

259
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,715
How could I have not seen this coming?

260
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:52,051
Now I'm gonna have to break
the little sad sack's heart.

261
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,221
I'm sure he'll be okay.

262
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,181
Oh, Penny.
Much as I would treasure knowing...

263
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,350
...the two of us had been defiled
by the same man...

264
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,686
...Leonard just doesn't get
my motor running.

265
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,694
So, um, what are you gonna do?
Do you want me to talk to Leonard?

266
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,947
- Let him down easy.
- No. I'll let him have tonight.

267
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,116
I'll send him an e-mail...

268
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,286
...letting him know this body
is never gonna be his wonderland.

269
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,915
I mean, frankly, you've got a better shot
than he does.

270
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,720
Leonard, check it out.

271
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,889
I bought an N gage locomotive.

272
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,016
Half the size of HO.

273
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,435
Look, it fits in my mouth.

274
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,938
Sounds like you had a great night.

275
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,066
I did.

276
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,610
- How was yours?
- Not bad.

277
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,279
I had a lot more fun with Amy
than I thought I would.

278
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,532
- What do you mean by that?
- It turns out she really knows...

279
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,285
...how to help a guy loosen up
and have a good time.

280
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:03,164
Although, truth be told,
my groin's a little worse for wear.

281
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,792
Ow!

282
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,172
- Why'd you do that?
- To send a message.

283
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,591
She is not for you.

284
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,177
- What?
- Not for you.

285
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,856
Good morning, handsome.

286
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,776
Morning, Mom.

287
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,572
It's me.

288
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,369
Yes, it is.
And you're so pretty in the morning.

289
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,164
Your mom and I made you breakfast.

290
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,751
Oh, wow, heh,
so you guys are getting along?

291
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,545
Yeah, I guess.

292
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:54,465
We're very different people, Howard,
so communication's a little tricky.

293
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,843
Does he like the pancakes?

294
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,053
He didn't try them yet!

295
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,351
- Is there any butter? Heh.
- It's butter-flavored syrup.

296
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,019
So? What's the word?

297
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,147
He wants butter!

298
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,859
It's butter-flavored syrup!

299
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,695
I just told him that!

300
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,869
I don't need any butter.

301
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,080
If you want butter, I'll get you butter.

302
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,212
Well, I guess I'll cut these by myself.
