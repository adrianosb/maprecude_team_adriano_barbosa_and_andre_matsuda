1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,397
And the next wedding gift is...

2
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:09,770
...a gravy boat.
- Oh, one gravy boat.

3
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,935
That's from Sheldon.
He told me he had it engraved.

4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:16,844
"In the event of a divorce
please return to Sheldon Cooper."

5
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,775
One inappropriate...

6
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:24,082
...yet-l-wish-l-thought-of-that
gravy boat.

7
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:27,852
When I get married, I'm gonna register
at the UCLA cadaver lab.

8
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,286
Ew. Why?

9
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,726
Because I've always wanted
a whole human skeleton...

10
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:33,160
...and they are really spendy.

11
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,231
You actually see you and Sheldon
getting married someday?

12
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:40,765
Not just someday,
in exactly four years.

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,568
But don't tell Sheldon,
he's still a flight risk.

14
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,306
What about you, Penny?

15
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:47,939
What about me, what?

16
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:51,106
Do you think you and Leonard
might ever get married?

17
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:56,817
Oh, well, you know, Leonard is great.

18
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,787
But do you think
you'll ever get married?

19
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,392
He's a sweetie.

20
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,156
You're not answering the question.

21
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,788
- Do you love him?
- Yes, sure, of course I love him.

22
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,333
- It doesn't sound like it.
- Well, I do.

23
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:15,802
- Do you tell him that?
- No, he'd just take it the wrong way.

24
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,640
- What does that mean?
- It means he is special...

25
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,110
...and smart, and nice, and...

26
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:25,012
- Are you gonna break up with him?
- No. Maybe, I don't know.

27
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,050
I had no idea you were unhappy.

28
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,950
That's the thing, I'm not.
I'm not unhappy at all.

29
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:33,320
I don't know, I've been in love before
but it felt different.

30
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,353
But maybe this is a new,
better, boring kind of love.

31
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,633
Do you ever feel
that way about Howard?

32
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,530
That's not really a fair comparison.

33
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,536
I'm basically married
to a sexy Buzz Lightyear.

34
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,539
Amy, you?

35
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,870
Can't help you.
Whenever I'm around Sheldon...

36
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,842
...I feels like my loins are on fire.

37
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,475
In the good way,
not the urinary tract infection way.

38
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,546
Hey, buddy, how's it going up there?

39
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,683
You don't have to shout, Raj.

40
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:35,378
It's not like I'm an astronaut
floating around in outer space.

41
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,682
Oh, wait, I am.

42
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,961
So is it everything
you hoped it would be?

43
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,860
It's better.
Heh, I wake up every morning...

44
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:51,367
...and I just can't believe
I'm on this incredible adventure.

45
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:55,201
Hey, Froot Loops,
did you clean the space toilet?

46
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,409
Excuse me, I'm talking to my friends.

47
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,242
You know the rules,
new guy scrubs the toilet.

48
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:08,520
If you do good job,
next time we give you brush.

49
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,618
Funny.

50
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,762
We're always giving each other
a hard time up here.

51
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,591
It's kind of like being in a frat.

52
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:23,065
You know, joking, kidding around,
hurting feelings.

53
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,068
- Okay, my turn. Let me talk to him.
- Go ahead.

54
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,264
2311 North Los Robles Avenue...

55
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,274
...Pasadena, California
to International Space Station.

56
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:32,468
Can you read me? Over.

57
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,082
Yes, I read you, Sheldon.

58
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,274
Copy that. Over.

59
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,849
- What are you doing?
- I'm talking to a man in space.

60
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,080
If you don't have the...

61
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,926
...he might as well be at the Coffee Bean
over on Lake Street.

62
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,187
You're out of your mind, Sheldon.

63
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,593
That's a negative.
My mother had me tested. Over.

64
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,325
Come on, scrub-a-dub, Loops.

65
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,136
All right. All right. I gotta go.

66
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,968
There's a meteor shower.

67
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,541
Wanna see a meteor shower?

68
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,578
Take a look at what Dimitri
just left you in the toilet.

69
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,710
- Bye.
- Over and out.

70
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:17,853
Bye, buddy!

71
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,389
- Hello?
- Hey, Stuart, come on in.

72
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,822
What are you doing here?

73
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,159
Um, Raj invited me to go to the movies
with you guys.

74
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:31,201
Excuse me, I didn't authorize this.

75
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:36,004
- Sheldon, you are not in charge.
- That's mighty sassy for a man...

76
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,973
...with a roommate performance review
around the corner.

77
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,312
What's the big deal?
You guys are bringing your girlfriends.

78
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,847
I didn't wanna sit by myself.

79
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:47,885
The big deal is, I was expecting us
to be an intimate group of five.

80
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,353
Now we're gonna be
a faceless mass of six.

81
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,321
It'll be fine.
Just, uh, pretend he's Wolowitz.

82
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,886
Hmm...

83
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,727
- Do you like Raisinets?
- I take them or leave them.

84
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,996
At the movies,
Wolowitz always eats Raisinets.

85
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,732
Would you feel more comfortable
if I ate Raisinets?

86
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,342
It's hardly my business what you eat.

87
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:14,571
As long as it doesn't crunch
during the film and it's Raisinets.

88
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:17,708
Okay.

89
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,545
- Should we go?
- Uh, one more question.

90
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,210
If you're gonna replace Wolowitz,
I need to know a little more about you.

91
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,686
- All right.
- Wolowitz went to MIT.

92
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,620
What's your educational background?

93
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,523
- I went to art school.
- Equally ridiculous. Let's go.

94
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:55,720
This insistence on hand-holding
is preposterous.

95
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,656
- Well, I like it.
- Yeah, of course you do, you're a girl.

96
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,590
You like all kinds
of hippie-dippy things.

97
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,993
Just watch the movie.

98
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,263
It's not fair.

99
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:12,097
Penny isn't making Leonard
hold hands.

100
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,266
There might be a reason for that.

101
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,807
Sweaty...

102
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,142
...unhygienic...

103
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,281
...Iooks dumb, take your pick.

104
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:27,713
Penny said she's not sure she wants
to be Leonard's girlfriend anymore.

105
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:34,825
Wrong. She just took a sip
from his Diet Dr. Pepper.

106
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,587
So?

107
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,254
So if she wants to end her pair-bond
with Leonard...

108
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:43,630
...why on earth would she guzzle
a witch's brew of his soda and spit?

109
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,497
It's complicated.

110
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,470
String Theory is complicated.

111
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,503
That's just yucky.

112
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,744
Don't get any ideas.

113
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,051
All right, for the sake of argument,
let's say that's true.

114
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,315
Why doesn't Penny just end
the relationship?

115
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,152
She's not sure how she feels.

116
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,285
How can she not be sure
how she feels?

117
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,227
You know, when I have a feeling,
I know it.

118
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,959
Trains? Love them.

119
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,060
Swordfish? I love them too.

120
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,469
They're fish with a sword for a nose.

121
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,746
Regardless, don't say anything
to Leonard.

122
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,406
You... Now you're asking me
to keep a secret from my best friend...

123
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,915
...colleague and roommate?

124
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,076
Yes, please. Penny will kill me.

125
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,483
Oh, fine.

126
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:41,149
FYI, secret-keeping. Hate it.

127
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,485
Hand-holding, not a fan.

128
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:48,229
Hammerhead shark, I love that thing.

129
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,693
Yeah, it's another fish
with a tool on its head.

130
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,900
- Raisinet?
- Shh! We're trying to watch the movie.

131
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,172
This is not working out with him.

132
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:20,465
- What are you doing?
- I think I might have tartar buildup.

133
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,931
My tongue won't go as far forward
as it used to.

134
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,635
Maybe your tongue is shrinking.

135
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,646
Nope.

136
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,413
Oh, you have no idea
how annoying this is.

137
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,426
I'm starting to get a sense of it.

138
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,431
Don't worry, I'll take you
to the dentist tomorrow.

139
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,089
Thank you.

140
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,931
I appreciate that.
You're good people, Leonard.

141
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,477
- There's something I need to tell you.
- Okay.

142
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,509
I can't tell you.

143
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,512
Why?

144
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,090
I can't tell you why I can't tell you.

145
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,395
So I guess there's two things
I can't tell you.

146
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,292
I wish there were more.

147
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,299
Good night.

148
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,510
- I'm sorry, this is really important.
- What is it?

149
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,006
I like the Transformers.

150
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:50,022
Do you like the Transformers?

151
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,649
Where exactly did your mother
have you tested?

152
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,618
Leonard.

153
00:09:56,062 --> 00:10:01,398
The Transformers teach us that things
are not always what they appear to be.

154
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:02,966
You know, like a...

155
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,468
A semi-truck might be an alien robot...

156
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,234
...or, uh, someone
in a romantic relationship...

157
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,344
...might feel differently
than they appear to.

158
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:17,175
Or a conversation
about the Transformers...

159
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,810
...might actually be about someone
in this room.

160
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,321
I'm gonna pause to let that sink in.

161
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,859
- Okay, I think I understand.
- You do?

162
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:38,731
The guy who seems like an emotionless
robot is you.

163
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:45,273
But your relationship with Amy
is causing you to transform...

164
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,539
...into a red-blooded man
with sexual desires.

165
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:56,085
That is literally the stupidest thing
I have ever heard.

166
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:06,724
Leonard.

167
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:07,991
Leonard.

168
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,725
Leonard.

169
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,526
What?

170
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,398
Are you sleeping?

171
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,597
I was, now I'm having a nightmare.

172
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,402
What?

173
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,414
Never mind. I still can't tell you.

174
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,345
Penny.

175
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,822
- Penny.
- Mmm.

176
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,726
Penny.

177
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,569
Oh, my God, Sheldon.

178
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,765
You frightened me.

179
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,705
What are you doing in my bedroom?

180
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,145
I knocked on the front door
but you didn't hear.

181
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:01,480
- How did you even get in, you weirdo?
- Yeah, yeah, really?

182
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,214
I've seen strange men traipsing in
and out of here for years...

183
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,153
...but when I do it, it's weird?

184
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,891
What do you want, Sheldon?

185
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,588
Well, I was having a little trouble
sleeping and I just thought...

186
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,563
...you know, seeing as you're up,
we could talk.

187
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,068
Talk about what?

188
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,967
Oh, I don't know. Uh, weather?

189
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,574
Uh, fish you could do carpentry with?

190
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,302
Why Leonard is such an attractive
and desirable boyfriend?

191
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,675
Pick one, your choice.

192
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,475
Sheldon...

193
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,982
Did you know that Leonard
has a perfect driving record...

194
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,486
...and enjoys the insurance discounts
that go along with that?

195
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,521
Hubba, hubba.

196
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,688
- Okay, go home, crazy man.
- You...

197
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:48,095
Did you know that while Leonard is not
considered a tall fellow in our country...

198
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,929
...in today's North Korea,
he's downright average?

199
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,268
Talk about a keeper.

200
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,367
Okay, what did Amy tell you?

201
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:00,943
Oh, very well. I can't keep up
this clever charade any longer.

202
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,516
She told me that you were thinking
of ending it with Leonard.

203
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:10,316
Okay, listen to me. It's really sweet
you're trying to protect your friend...

204
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,548
...but this is none of your business.
Got it?

205
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:16,320
Excuse me,
this is not about protecting my friend.

206
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,969
I'm a big fan of homeostasis.

207
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,503
- Do you know what that is?
- Of course not.

208
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:33,873
Homeostasis refers to a system's ability
to regulate its internal environment.

209
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:38,915
Yeah, and maintain a constant condition
of properties like temperature or pH.

210
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,848
Worst bedtime story ever.

211
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,390
My point is,
I don't like when things change.

212
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,929
So, regardless of your feelings, I would
like you to continue dating Leonard.

213
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:57,224
And also, while we're on the subject,
you recently changed your shampoo.

214
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,769
I'm not comfortable
with the new scent.

215
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,341
Will you please stop this madness
and go back to green apple?

216
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,436
Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out.

217
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,911
And until I do,
you are not to say a word to Leonard.

218
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,246
- Do you understand?
- I do.

219
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,851
- You clear on the shampoo issue?
- Get out.

220
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,891
- Penny?
- What?

221
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,697
Please don't hurt my friend.

222
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,031
- That is the last thing I want to do.
- Thank you.

223
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,397
Coconut. What were you thinking?
Are you a hula-girl?

224
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,940
Out!

225
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,644
- Hello?
- What the hell is wrong with you?

226
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,881
You told Sheldon? Do you know
what a terrible position this puts me in?

227
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,460
Hang on, please.

228
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,925
- Hello?
- Yeah, just a heads-up.

229
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,898
Penny knows that you blabbed
about Leonard. She's pretty mad.

230
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,963
I know. She's yelling at me right now.

231
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:10,304
All right then,
so we're all on the same page.

232
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,574
Hey, Bernie.

233
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,943
There's my hubby.

234
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,744
How's everything going up there?

235
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,477
Oh, it's okay.

236
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:26,591
Space is beautiful, Earth is beautiful.
Same old, same old.

237
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,992
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

238
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,824
- Everything's fine, heh.
- Howard.

239
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,964
The other astronauts
are being mean to me.

240
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,107
No, what are they doing?

241
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,210
Well, like, for instance,
the other day, when I was asleep...

242
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,369
...one of the guys
went on a space-walk...

243
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:54,486
...and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask
to the outside of my window.

244
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:59,018
When I woke up,
I screamed for like nine minutes.

245
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,190
Oh, Howie.

246
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,453
You can see it if you want.
It's on YouTube.

247
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,462
Google "Astronaut screams
for nine minutes."

248
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,997
Why don't you stand up to them?

249
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,296
What am I supposed to say?

250
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,033
I don't know.

251
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,731
Say, "Being mean is lame.

252
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,810
What's cool is being nice."

253
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:31,222
Great, I'll do that when I wanna
be the first guy in space to get a wedgie.

254
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,582
Do you want me to call somebody
at NASA?

255
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:39,696
No, my mom already tried that.
It only made things worse.

256
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,095
Gelatinous Sphere.

257
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,835
Focused Locust.

258
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,674
Temple of Yip.

259
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,875
I'm sorry,
Wolowitz would never play that card.

260
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:57,682
All right, Lesser Demon Turtle.

261
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,181
Fairy God Monster, I win.

262
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,180
Your desperate need for friendship
makes you weak.

263
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,755
So, what are you guys doing later?

264
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,417
Stuart and I were thinking
of going out for a drink.

265
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,531
- Try to meet some girls.
- Because that's what we do, heh.

266
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:20,237
So watch out, ladies, a little coffee
and cream coming your way.

267
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,974
In case you didn't follow that,
I'm the coffee.

268
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:30,308
Leonard, maybe you'd like to go
with them to meet girls.

269
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,473
Why would I be interested?
I have Penny.

270
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,619
Yeah, for now.

271
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,088
But that woman has a death wish,
Leonard.

272
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:42,284
Yeah, she talks to strangers,
she pets unfamiliar dogs...

273
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:47,228
...and it is ridiculously easy
to break into her apartment.

274
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,326
If I were you, I'd get a backup.

275
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:54,768
You can't just replace someone you care
about with some other random person.

276
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,568
Uh, please don't ruin this for me.

277
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,179
Do you remember how upset I was...

278
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,941
...when they replaced
Edward Norton as the Hulk?

279
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,244
Yes, you walked around for a week...

280
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,513
...saying,
"Sheldon unhappy with casting choice."

281
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:17,652
But then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk
in The Avengers and he was even better.

282
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,321
- What's your point?
- Call me a romantic.

283
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:25,493
I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo
is still out there somewhere.

284
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,973
This is ridiculous.
Are we gonna play cards or not?

285
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:34,101
- I like Mark Ruffalo too.
- Yeah, settle down there, fake Wolowitz.

286
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,275
No one likes a kiss-up.

287
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,511
So I had to take Sheldon
to the dentist this morning.

288
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,452
- Really?
- Yeah.

289
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:49,788
I told him that if he didn't bite the
hygienist I'd take him for ice cream.

290
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,988
I didn't have to take him for ice cream.

291
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,199
Uh-huh.

292
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,369
You okay?
You seem a little distracted.

293
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,865
Look,
there's something I need to tell you.

294
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,409
Oh, yeah, okay.

295
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,309
- I don't really know how to say this.
- Just say it.

296
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,642
- Okay, here goes...
- Mm-hm.

297
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,685
You slept with him?

298
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:27,725
I didn't know what else to do.
He had those big, sad eyes.

299
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,528
Oh, sure, you had no choice.

300
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,568
He looked at me like this.

301
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,742
If that's all it takes,
it's a good thing you don't have a dog.

302
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,879
Don't worry, you'll have plenty
of chances to break up with him.

303
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:53,855
Your wedding day, your honeymoon,
your 50th anniversary.

304
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,460
Look, it's fine,
we're not getting married, okay?

305
00:19:56,628 --> 00:20:00,689
We're keeping things, you know,
homeostasis.

306
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,801
It's so cute when she tries.

307
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,865
It's from Leonard.

308
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,239
"Last night was amazing.
You're amazing.

309
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,507
I'm so lucky to have you in my life."

310
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,284
Okay, stop it.

311
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:30,120
Hey, Bernie, guess what? I stood up
to the other astronauts like you said.

312
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:33,492
And I gotta tell you last night
was the first time in a week...

313
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,189
...I got a good night's sleep.

314
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,308
Oh, Howie.

315
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,536
What's wrong? You look upset.

316
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:48,941
Nope.

317
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,708
This is my proud face.
