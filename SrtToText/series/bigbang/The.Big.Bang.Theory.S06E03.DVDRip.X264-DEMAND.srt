1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,960
Hey, Bernie.

2
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:07,732
Hey. How's my little astronauttie hottie?

3
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:09,766
Okay, I guess.

4
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:14,437
It's just being cooped up in this tin can
for weeks on end is starting to get to me.

5
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:18,106
Hang in there. You just have a couple
more days to go and you'll be home.

6
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:21,879
- I know.
- I gotta get back to work. I love you.

7
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,545
Love you too. Hey, Bernie...

8
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:27,921
...before you go,
can you do something for me?

9
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:29,391
What do you want me to do?

10
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,920
Okay, here it is.

11
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,090
I really miss gravity.

12
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:40,900
Can you drop something
so I can watch it fall?

13
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,902
Really? You're serious?

14
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,810
Okay.

15
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:54,519
Oh, baby, you're killing me.

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,817
Unh. Hey, Sheldon? Hi.

17
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,756
This came for you today.
It's from your mom.

18
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,522
- Oh. Thank you, Penny.
- Mhmm.

19
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:06,688
Yeah, wait. Here.

20
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,792
For your troubles.

21
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,133
Oh, boy, a whole dollar.

22
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:15,831
Now I can quit my paper route.

23
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:18,668
So, what's in it?

24
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:22,838
Doesn't matter. Half the time,
he just ends up playing with the box.

25
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:26,416
Yeah, it's journals and research papers
I wrote as a child.

26
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,451
Aw. How cute.

27
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,145
Is this, like, a diary?

28
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,917
No, that's my potty-training journal.

29
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:36,320
- Really? Your potty-training journal?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:40,455
And forgive my crude penmanship.
I didn't start typing until I was 6.

31
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,903
"August 7th, 8:42 a.m.

32
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,767
This is humiliating.
What was wrong with diapers?"

33
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,540
There are some charts in the back...

34
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,111
...where I kept track of shape,
color and consistency.

35
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,611
Oh!

36
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,377
Disgusting.

37
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,987
No, what's disgusting
is he's still keeping track.

38
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,885
- Why do you need this...?
- No, no, no.

39
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,525
- Sorry.
- I am glad you asked.

40
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:10,129
- Oh.
- Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?

41
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,196
Heh. Of course.

42
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:16,961
It is... It's been in the news.
And it's a very famous boson.

43
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,762
Nice try. No, in 1964...

44
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,205
...Dr. Peter Higgs, accomplished
self-promoter and physicist...

45
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,675
...he wrote a paper
postulating the existence...

46
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,679
...of a subatomic particle
called the Higgs boson.

47
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,443
Now, initially, the paper was rejected.

48
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,712
But recently, he was proven right.

49
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,755
And now he's on the fast track
to win a Nobel Prize.

50
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,916
- Yeah. That's basically what I said.
- Yeah...

51
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:46,763
The point is, Higgs is being celebrated
for work he did 50 years ago.

52
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,127
So that got me thinking.

53
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:52,931
Perhaps I've already hit upon the idea
that will win me my Nobel Prize.

54
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,872
I didn't know they gave Nobel Prizes
for making boom-boom in the potty.

55
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:02,242
You really think there's some kind of
scientific discovery in here?

56
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,248
Well, this box only covers
my work through nursery school.

57
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:09,081
There's a good deal more to come.
I didn't really hit my academic stride...

58
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:12,747
...until I cut out that time-suck
known as playing outdoors.

59
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,923
You're gonna spend hours and hours
combing through all this stuff?

60
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:20,088
That's a good point.
My time is much too valuable.

61
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,598
Perhaps I should find someone
to do it for me.

62
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,329
Someone with a rudimentary
understanding of science...

63
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:29,338
...but whose real talents lie
in menial labor.

64
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,545
- Not gonna happen.
- Yeah, well...

65
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:39,415
If I didn't think you could handle it,
I wouldn't be asking.

66
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,178
If you want help, just hire a grad student.

67
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,153
- Maybe I could do it.
- Really.

68
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:50,194
You can assess the quality of my work?
Okay. Um, here.

69
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,558
I wrote this when I was 5 years old.

70
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,297
"A proof that algebraic topology...

71
00:03:55,468 --> 00:04:00,599
...can never have a non-self-contradictory
set of abelian groups."

72
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,871
I'm just a blond monkey to you,
aren't I?

73
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,281
You said it, not me.

74
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:45,182
All right, Ms. Jensen, before we begin,
may I offer you a refreshment?

75
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,546
Water, coffee, tea?

76
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,847
A marijuana cigarette?

77
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,350
No, thanks, I'm fine.

78
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:56,325
Are you sure?
Everyone's smoking them.

79
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,387
I think they're the best.

80
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,900
- I don't do drugs.
- Excellent.

81
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,398
Yeah. That was a ruse.

82
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:07,039
They're not the best. Physics is the best.

83
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,533
By the way, coffee was also
an unacceptable choice.

84
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,669
All right, so I see here
you're from Des Moines, Iowa.

85
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:18,578
You're summa cum laude in theoretical
physics from Stanford University.

86
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:23,381
Oh, and two years ago
you had a persistent ear infection.

87
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,820
I hope that didn't cause
any hearing loss.

88
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,584
No, of course not.

89
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,193
How did you know about that?

90
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,523
Well, I did a comprehensive
background check.

91
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:35,259
Medical records, credit reports,
criminal history.

92
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,495
I trust you paid off
those parking tickets.

93
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:39,895
Yes, I did.

94
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,065
Hearing unimpaired. Good.

95
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,676
Look, Dr. Cooper,
I really want this position.

96
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,337
It would be an incredible honor
to work for a man of your brilliance.

97
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:53,115
Flattery will not get you this job,
Ms. Jensen.

98
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,550
It's not flattery if it's the truth.

99
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,484
Oh.

100
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,181
Well, thank you. Welcome aboard.

101
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,121
- Talked to Howard, lately?
- Yeah, last night.

102
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,664
He kept making me drop pencils
for him.

103
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,229
I got uncomfortable.

104
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,533
Hope you're hungry.
They're serving macaroni and...

105
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,800
...cheese.

106
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,976
Smooth.

107
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:25,750
- Hi.
- Hello.

108
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,613
Aren't you gonna introduce us?

109
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:31,223
No. I have people for that now.
You're up.

110
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,449
I'm Alex, Dr. Cooper's new assistant.

111
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:37,221
Ah, congratulations,
and may God have mercy on your soul.

112
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,125
- I'm Leonard, this is Raj.
- Nice to meet you.

113
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,062
I'm so excited to be working with...

114
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,726
Please reserve chitchat for your breaks,
Ms. Jensen.

115
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,702
And FYI, there'll be no breaks.

116
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,576
I should probably get to work.

117
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:54,970
She seems nice.

118
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,242
Hey, you already got a girlfriend.
I call dibs.

119
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,644
- All I said was "She seems nice."
- Yeah, well, I love her.

120
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,661
Hey, I wasn't expecting
to hear from you today.

121
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,266
- Everything okay?
- Uh, no, not really.

122
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,471
What's wrong?

123
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,131
Well, remember the Soyuz capsule
they were sending to bring us home?

124
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,436
- Uh-huh.
- It's delayed.

125
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,841
We're gonna be here
at least another week, maybe 10 days.

126
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,676
It's the Russians, so you don't know.

127
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,514
They left dogs up here in the '60s.

128
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,193
Come on, Howard.
No one's leaving you up there.

129
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:45,421
I don't know how much
longer I can take this. I can't sleep.

130
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,863
And zero-gravity
is giving me crazy acid reflux.

131
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,970
I'm down to my last three Tums.

132
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:54,832
You're gonna be fine.

133
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,635
You survived that Weight Watchers
cruise with your mom.

134
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,512
And they ran out of low-fat ice cream
on day two.

135
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,209
Just calm down
and take a few deep breaths.

136
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,513
Okay, okay.

137
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:15,018
What am I doing?
I'm using up all the oxygen.

138
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,989
If I die, promise you'll never have sex
with another man.

139
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,238
Oh, yeah.

140
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,107
I'm a man-eater now.

141
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,449
Okay, for the final touch,
this is an eyelash-curler.

142
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:43,385
You just place it on your lashes
and squeeze it closed.

143
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,854
Oh. I don't know.

144
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,552
Looks like something
used by Tinker Bell's gynecologist.

145
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,756
Who I hope, for her sake,
is not Captain Hook, so...

146
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,097
Who you calling?

147
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,538
- I'm gonna video-chat Sheldon.
- Hmm.

148
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,438
If my new look leads to phone sex...

149
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,977
...I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave the room.

150
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,640
Dr. Cooper's office.

151
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,647
Oh. Hello. Who are you?

152
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,752
I'm Alex, Dr. Cooper's assistant.

153
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,321
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to speak to Sheldon.

154
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,651
I'm sorry,
he's asked me to hold all calls...

155
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:24,296
...unless you're Stephen Hawking,
his mother, or himself from the future.

156
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,392
- All right, well, tell him Amy called.
- Last name?

157
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,628
He knows my last name.
I'm his girlfriend.

158
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:35,305
We have a contract and everything.
I'll send you a PDF.

159
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,241
All right. I will tell him you called.

160
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,615
- Hmm. That's weird.
- What?

161
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,079
Sheldon told me
he had a new assistant named Alex.

162
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,187
He didn't mention that Alex was a girl.

163
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,754
Maybe he didn't notice.

164
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,657
You're right.
I don't have to worry about Sheldon.

165
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:57,295
No, you do not.

166
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,159
It's her I have to worry about.

167
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,770
Oh. Amy, really?
She is not gonna come on to Sheldon.

168
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,029
Oh, really?

169
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,264
Look at this face.

170
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:14,271
How can any woman spend eight hours
a day alone with this face...

171
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,915
...and not fall in love with it?

172
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,920
Well, for starters, at some point,
that face starts talking.

173
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,560
Amy, this is crazy.
You have nothing to be suspicious about.

174
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,788
I'm not suspicious.

175
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,957
I just wanna stop in, say hi to my boyfriend,
and meet his new assistant.

176
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,602
Aha!

177
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,510
- Can we go now?
- Hang on.

178
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,317
- What are you doing?
- Isn't it obvious?

179
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:58,253
I'm spreading my scent
to mark my territory.

180
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,256
Come on, Amy,
that is not gonna work.

181
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,089
Really? Because just before
you became my best friend...

182
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:08,233
...I did this all over your apartment.

183
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,439
Has your assistant
said anything about me?

184
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,905
Oh, in fact, she has.

185
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:21,410
Her exact words were
"What is that guy's problem?"

186
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:26,684
I'm in her head. Let the dance begin.

187
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,414
Here's your frozen yogurt, Dr. Cooper.

188
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:31,851
This should be fun.

189
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,891
Half chocolate, half vanilla,
side by side, not swirled?

190
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,722
- Yes.
- Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?

191
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,193
- Rainbow.
- Two cherries?

192
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,195
- One on top, one on the bottom.
- Stems removed?

193
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,063
Um... Top one, yes.
I didn't check the one on the bottom.

194
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,033
Oh!

195
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,803
I'm so sorry, Dr. Cooper.

196
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,775
It's all right, Alex. I'm not mad at you.
I'm just disappointed.

197
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,314
Wait, Alex, do you wannajoin us?

198
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,211
- Um...
- Alex, a moment.

199
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,548
I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter.

200
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:09,120
Do you think it's appropriate
for her to sit with us, given her station?

201
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,924
Given her what?

202
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,261
If I've learned anything
from British television shows on PBS...

203
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:19,962
...it's that servants dine downstairs
with their own kind.

204
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,774
What?

205
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,103
It's a kindness, Leonard.

206
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,268
Otherwise, you're cruelly tempting them...

207
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:32,543
...with a glimpse of a world that's just
beyond their soot-stained fingertips.

208
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,647
Oh, sure.

209
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,312
- Please join us.
- Oh, okay. Thank you.

210
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,016
So, Alex,
what's the topic of your dissertation?

211
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:44,560
I'm looking for Trojan asteroids
at Earth's L-5 Lagrange point.

212
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,791
Oh. That happens to be Dr. Koothrappali's
field of expertise.

213
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,266
You two have a lot to talk about.

214
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,797
Is that true?

215
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,686
- Is he all right?
- No.

216
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:17,523
But compared to your boss,
he's the poster boy for sanity.

217
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,397
It's okay,
I've been around scientists all my life.

218
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,965
- My dad's an astronomer at SETI.
- Oh, SETI.

219
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,296
The Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

220
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,133
You should introduce him to Sheldon.
The search is over.

221
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,337
What kind of research are you doing?

222
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,842
- High-energy lasers.
- Ooh, military?

223
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:37,346
Not yet, but I can remove unwanted hair
from 2 miles away.

224
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,679
You were right.
I had nothing to worry about.

225
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,345
That skank's your problem, not mine.

226
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,354
- You're very funny, Dr. Hofstadter.
- Oh, thank you.

227
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,722
Agh! Cherry stem. Cherry stem.

228
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,263
How you doing, Howie?
You feeling a little better?

229
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:02,169
Oh. A lot better, thanks. One sec.

230
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,905
Listen close, I don't have a lot of time.

231
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,212
I need you to go to my house.

232
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,407
In my bedroom you'll find a model rocket.
I want you to bring it back to your place.

233
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,110
Okay.

234
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:17,187
Step two, build a version
roughly 14 stories high.

235
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,682
Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me.

236
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,556
I'll leave the door unlocked.

237
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,191
Maybe you should talk to someone.

238
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,527
Let them know
you're having a little anxiety.

239
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,934
No, no. I'm fine. No anxiety.

240
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,937
We should probably talk in code.

241
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:40,272
From now on, "frog" is me, "sandwich"
means you, and "lemon" means rocket.

242
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:44,542
So come on, sandwich, build me a lemon
because froggie wants to come home.

243
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,581
Look at you...

244
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,190
...putting on a brave face.

245
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,451
There's nothing to be brave about.
Everything's fine.

246
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,066
Really? I don't know how much
you know about primate behavior...

247
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,498
...but Sheldon's assistant
was clearly courting Leonard.

248
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,830
Were she a mandrill,
she would've bent over...

249
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:11,340
...and displayed her brightly colored
hindquarters like a big red welcome mat.

250
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:16,637
By the way, you try that
at the junior prom, you get kicked out.

251
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,816
Okay, maybe she was flirting with him,
but who cares?

252
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,922
I don't even know where
my relationship is with Leonard now.

253
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,819
So says your prefrontal cortex.

254
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,483
But the limbic system of your brain
is calculating...

255
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,130
...that if another woman is attracted
to Leonard...

256
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,129
...it must be because he's desirable.

257
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,667
Well, of course he's desirable.
I mean, he's great.

258
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,703
He's smart, he's sweet,
and in the bedroom, whew...

259
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:44,502
...let me tell you, he really tries.

260
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,309
So it does bother you.

261
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,971
Fine, it bothers me a little.

262
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,619
No, you know what? This is stupid.
It doesn't bother me.

263
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,181
Okay, it bothers me.

264
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:02,255
But only because she wouldn't stop laughing.
Leonard is not that funny.

265
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,056
And there you have it...

266
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,131
...prefrontal-cortex reasoning
versus limbic lust.

267
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,166
If this were a boxing match
they might call it...

268
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,237
...the Thriller Adjacent to the Amygdala.

269
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:21,979
If you were a brain scientist,
you would be busting a gut right now.

270
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,884
- So how was work today?
- Oh, it was all right, I guess.

271
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,284
Had to Heimlich a cherry stem
out of Sheldon.

272
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,489
- Caught Raj right in the eye.
- Oh.

273
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,490
- You're kidding.
- No, Raj had to go to the nurse.

274
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,189
Wow. Anything else?

275
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:45,235
Mm, the nurse is a woman,
so he couldn't talk to her.

276
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,702
She had to bring him the Grover puppet
so he could point at what hurt. Heh.

277
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,274
Is that it?

278
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,415
Isn't that enough?

279
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,212
It had weaponized fruit and a puppet.
What more do you want?

280
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,377
Oh, good. Leonard, you're here.

281
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,853
Science news. This will interest you.

282
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,687
And, Penny,
feel free to paint your nails.

283
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,956
- What do you got?
- I believe Alex may have unearthed...

284
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:17,193
...the grade-school science project that
could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize.

285
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,802
Behold.

286
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,201
"Magnets: What Do They Stick To?"

287
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:27,073
If the answer is metal,
it's not exactly groundbreaking.

288
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,372
The original title was:

289
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:32,244
"A Rederivation of Maxwell's Equations
Regarding Electromagnetism."

290
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,751
I dumbed it down because some
of the more religious people in town...

291
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,481
...were starting to say I was a witch.

292
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:42,218
Sheldon thinks the approach
in his paper might change the way...

293
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:47,388
...we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis.
- Oh. It's about time. I hated the old way.

294
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,030
- Hi, I'm Penny.
- Alex.

295
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:53,137
- Do you work with Dr. Hofstadter?
- In a way.

296
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,233
We've kind of been involved
in a five-year experiment.

297
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,936
Oh. Well, you're lucky.
He seems very talented.

298
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,275
I'm sure a lot of people
wanna work with him.

299
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,419
Oh, well, a lot of people can't, so...

300
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,020
Uh, come on.

301
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,616
Where are we going?

302
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,987
My limbic system
wants to take your pants off.

303
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,825
She seems nice.

304
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,159
Notice people on your own time.
We're working.

305
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,502
Hey, Howie, how you feeling?

306
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,473
Better. Much better.

307
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:38,549
The other astronauts held me down
and gave me a shot.

308
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,149
Ooh.

00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,354
Attention, people of Earth.

310
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:56,331
Tonight there will be two moons
in the sky.

311
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,503
Howie, stop that.

312
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,501

313
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,163

314
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,804
Whee!

00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:11,539
Whee!
