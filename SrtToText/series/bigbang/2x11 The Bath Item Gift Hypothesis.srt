1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:03,678
Your argument is lacking
in all scientific merit.

2
00:00:03,853 --> 00:00:05,445
And it is well-established...

3
00:00:05,622 --> 00:00:08,955
...Superman cleans his uniform
by flying into Earth's yellow sun...

4
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:11,218
...which incinerates
any contaminant matter...

5
00:00:11,394 --> 00:00:15,694
...and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian
fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,991
What if he gets something
Kryptonian on it?

7
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:23,105
- Like what?
- I don't know. Kryptonian mustard.

8
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,333
I think we can assume all Kryptonian
condiments were destroyed...

9
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:29,103
...when the planet Krypton exploded.

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,213
Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite.

11
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:35,545
The only way to destroy a rogue
Kryptonian hot dog threatening Earth.

12
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:39,046
Raj, please, let's stay serious here.

13
00:00:39,222 --> 00:00:42,783
Superman's body is Kryptonian,
therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.

14
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,450
Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?

15
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:47,692
Superman doesn't sweat on Earth.

16
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:50,560
Okay. He's invited for dinner
in the bottle city of Kandor.

17
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:54,170
He miniaturizes himself, enters the city,
where he loses his super-powers.

18
00:00:54,337 --> 00:00:57,431
Before dinner, his host says,
"Who's up for Kryptonian tetherball?"

19
00:00:57,607 --> 00:01:00,804
Superman works up a sweat, comes back
to Earth, his uniform now stained...

20
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,537
...with indestructible
Kryptonian perspiration.

21
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,241
Booyah.

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,380
Superman would have taken his uniform
to a Kandorian dry-cleaner...

23
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:15,683
...before he left the bottle.

24
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:20,625
Kandorian dry-cl--? I give up. You can't have
a rational argument with this man.

the MacArthur genius grant last year?

- No.

- That's David Underhill. So what?
- So what?

32
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,716
His observation of high-energy positrons
has provided the first evidence...

33

...for the existence
of galactic dark matter.

The first is "big," the other's "whoop."

at the right time...

Hey, Sheldon. Are you and Leonard
putting up a Christmas tree?

91
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,501
No, because we don't celebrate
the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia.

Gather around, kids. It's time for Sheldon's
beloved Christmas special.

94
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:41,754
In the pre-Christian era, as the winter
solstice approached and the plants died...

95
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,792
...pagans brought evergreen boughs in their
homes as an act of sympathetic magic...

...intended to guard the life essences
of the plants until spring.

I would ever call you is a geek.

Oh, well, that's what I am.
Queen of the nerds.

the lab we're working in.

You know, I have always wanted to see
a big science lab.

- Since always.

- Yeah, I guess.
- How about we go see it now?

You're kidding.

That's the estrogen hat trick.

This is an amazing woman, Leonard.
She has a curious and agile mind.

shots on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.

I might under- or over-reciprocate...

I will open her gift to me first and then
excuse myself, feigning digestive distress.

Then I'll look up the price
of her gift online...

...choose the basket closest to that value,
give it to her...

for a full refund.
