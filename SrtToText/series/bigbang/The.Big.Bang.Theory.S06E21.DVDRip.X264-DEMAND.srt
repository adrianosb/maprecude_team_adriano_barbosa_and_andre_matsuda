1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,665
Oh, dear.

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:08,636
Penny, have you been recording
shows on our DVR again?

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:12,972
- No.
- Answer honestly. This is not a trial.

4
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,341
That will come later.

5
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,539
Absolutely not.

6
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:20,753
Help me out here.
I can't afford another demerit.

7
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:26,684
Uh, maybe we were hacked. The Chinese
have been hacking everything lately.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,756
Why would the Chinese make our DVR
record Paul Blart: Mall Cop?

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,062
I don't know.

10
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:38,031
It's a fat guy on a Segway.
That's funny everywhere.

11
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,300
- I'm deleting it.
- Hang on.

12
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:44,272
Maybe the Chinese
haven't finished watching it yet.

13
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,338
If you're trying to make space on the DVR...

14
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:52,541
...why don't you get rid of stuff
you've already watched? Like Alphas.

15
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,346
No, that's the season-two finale.
Quite the cliffhanger.

16
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,887
I'm gonna rewatch it
before season three starts.

17
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,025
There's no season three.
They canceled that show.

18
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,790
Well, they can't cancel it.
It ended on a cliffhanger.

19
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,959
Well, they did.

20
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:10,966
There are two dumplings left.
Want them?

21
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:14,231
Dumplings? Don't you understand
what's going on here?

22
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,306
As a rule, no.

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,041
That show ended with all the residents
of New York either dead or unconscious.

24
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,579
Now I'll never know what happened.

25
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,614
Why don't you make up
your own ending?

26
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,082
Oh. Sure, what a wonderful idea.

27
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,313
And after that I'll make up my own rules
of oral hygiene...

28
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:34,618
...and instead of flossing,
I'll rub pudding on my gums.

29
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:37,524
I'm gonna get the number of
the Syfy Channel and give them what for.

30
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,221
Oh, please don't do that.

31
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,923
No. They can't just cancel
a show like Alphas.

32
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,228
They have to help the viewers let go.

33
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,928
Firefly did a movie to wrap things up.

34
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,109
Buffy the Vampire Slayer
continued on as a comic book.

35
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:53,437
Heroes gradually lowered the quality
season by season...

36
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,477
...until we were grateful it ended.

37
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,617
I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.

38
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,016
Ah, don't. If they didn't wanna be
yelled at by crazy nerds...

39
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,418
...they shouldn't have started
a sci-fi channel.

40
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,052
I think you're gonna be really happy
with this security camera.

41
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,780
The optics are great.
It's got infrared technology.

42
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,391
And there's even a backup battery
when the power goes out.

43
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:43,824
Whatever. I can see my little princess
while I'm at work, right?

44
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,164
Why can't you watch porn
like a regular guy?

45
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,333
Give me your laptop so I can
configure the software.

46
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,633
Hold on. This is weird.

47
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,900
What?

48
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,908
I was Googling that girl I've been dating
and found her blog.

49
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,047
Cool. Anything juicy?

50
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,410
She said she recently went
on a date with a guy named Roger.

51
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,482
And he's Indian.

52
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,617
And he's an astrophysicist too!

53
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,655
- You know what's going on, don't you?
- Yes.

54
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,698
Mommy was right.
American girls are sexually voracious devils.

55
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,168
I can't believe I have to explain this.
People change names on blogs...

56
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,206
...to protect their privacy. "Roger" is Raj.

57
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,775
Oh.

58
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:35,403
I always thought if I had a white name,
it would be Gavin.

59
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,451
- Keep reading. What does it say?
- No, I don't know if I should.

60
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,487
If she wanted me to know about her blog,
she would've told me.

61
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:47,524
- It's almost like I'm reading her diary.
- It's exactly what it's like. Keep reading.

62
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,695
No, this is creepy.

63
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:54,390
Oh... I think we were looking at creepy in the
rearview mirror when I put up that camera.

64
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,069
It's not creepy. Don't listen to him.

65
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,335
Ooh, who's got the sweetest kisses?

66
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,545
Should I go?

67
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,091
With all the TV Sheldon was talking about,
I had the greatest idea ever.

68
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:26,288
It blows away my idea for a Star Wars-themed
coffee shop called Brewbacca's.

69
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,564
You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
The perfect show for the two of us.

70
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,868
It's got action and jokes and hot vampires
and romance. I cannot oversell this.

71
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:38,407
What do you say?

72
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,080
It's 6:30 in the morning.

73
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,744
I thought you grew up on a farm.

74
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:53,658
Hello, Syfy Network,
this is your vice president of programing.

75
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,827
We have made a horrible mistake
regarding Alphas.

76
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,897
We need to uncancel it immediately.

77
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,126
Put me through
to the people who handle that.

78
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,271
Tell them it's me.
I don't wanna answer a lot of questions...

79
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,303
...about if I really am who I say I am.

80
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,067
I just... I want this done.

81
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,175
No, I'm not the person who just called.

82
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,540
That man was clearly a cowboy...

83
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,976
...concerned about y'all
canceling his favorite show.

84
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,788
Why do they keep hanging up on me?

85
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,426
I'm sorry you're upset.

86
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:34,328
Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort
of physical contact in moments like this.

87
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:43,335
I am not flying back to Texas
just so my mom can give me a hug.

88
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,272
Okay. Well, what I think is going on here...

89
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,177
...is you have a pathological need
for closure.

90
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,443
Oh. That's nonsense.

91
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:57,680
You tell me stories about your day
all the time. I don't care how they end.

92
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,790
You know, I might be able
to help you with this.

93
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,725
There's a field of behavioral neuroscience
that examines...

94
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:09,459
...ways to retrain your neural pathways
so stuff like this bothers you less.

95
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,365
But I just told you,
I don't have a problem with closure.

96
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,199
- You sure about that?
- Quite sure.

97
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,511
That proves nothing.

98
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,058
- Ready to go to lunch?
- Do you think I'm feminine?

99
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:40,030
- Yeah, let's go.
- Thanks a lot.

100
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,192
- What's going on?
- I broke down and I read Lucy's blog.

101
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,568
In one of the entries she said when we
first met, I struck her as a little feminine.

102
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,877
Just a little? That's great.

103
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,236
I have to talk to her about this.

104
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:57,075
Ahh. Jeez, why do you girls always want
to talk about things?

105
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,411
Listen to me, if she's writing about
your relationship, use it to your advantage.

106
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,715
- Rig the game.
- That doesn't seem fair.

107
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:10,385
Is it fair that girls like confident,
normal guys more than nervous weirdos?

108
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,928
No, it's not.
I've always thought that was unfair.

109
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,398
So take what's in that blog
and use it to get her pants off.

110
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,370
Why do you make everything filthy?
Why couldn't you say the blog is like...

111
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,543
...her giving me the key to her heart?

112
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,907
"The key to her heart." Heh. That's nice.

113
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,572
Were you quoting someone
or is it tattooed on the small of your back?

114
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:37,484
I was quoting a man who knows a thing
or two about women: Sir Elton John.

115
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,866
So did you love it? Of course you
loved it. Tell me how much you loved it.

116
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,130
It was cute.

117
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,606
Aw, don't say "cute." That's the worst.

118
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,712
- What's wrong with cute?
- It just makes things seem small.

119
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,279
It diminishes them.

120
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,782
So you want me to stop calling
your little tushy cute?

121
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,922
You can try,
but nobody's gonna believe you.

122
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:16,091
I don't understand how you can watch
a show that great and not be excited by it.

123
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,856
- I liked it. I'm excited.
- Well, then tell your face.

124
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,235
- What do you want from me?
- You know what? Never mind.

125
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,428
We gave it a shot.
Let's just see what else is on.

126
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:30,736
Oh, come on, don't be like that.
I'm sorry I called it cute.

127
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,467
- Let's watch another one.
- Really?

128
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,647
Yeah. It was fun.
It kind of reminded me of my high school.

129
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,284
But instead of vampires,
we had meth-heads. Ahem.

130
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,481
But both came out at night
and had messed up teeth.

131
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,487
All right, cool.
I think you'll like the next one better.

132
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,150
All the cheerleaders
are suffering from an evil curse.

133
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,523
Oh. Well, that's like my high school too.

134
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,829
But instead of a curse, it was crabs. Heh.

135
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,000
I've come up with a series of exercises
to help with your compulsive need for closure.

136
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,268
I take issue with the word "compulsive."

137
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:12,050
All I'm saying is we live in a world
where closure isn't always an op...

138
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,491
- tion! Okay!

139
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,392
For the sake of argument,
let's say I have a problem.

140
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,502
What would be your plan
for addressing it?

141
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,036
I'm going to recondition your brain...

142
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,574
...so that the need for completion
isn't be so overwhelming.

143
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,840
- By playing tic-tac-toe?
- Yep, your turn.

144
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,747
Oh, Amy. And you wonder why
people think neuroscience...

145
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,252
...is nothing but a goofy game
for diaper babies.

146
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:55,390
Tic-tac-toe can only end
in win, lose or draw.

147
00:09:55,595 --> 00:10:00,259
None of which will deny me closure,
especially since I'm about to win.

148
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,039
But we didn't finish.

149
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,271
Exactly. How does that make you feel?

150
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,375
The same way
any normal person would.

151
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:24,421
Feel like I wanna peel off my own face,
tear it in two and then again and again...

152
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,252
...until I have a handful of
Sheldon-face confetti.

153
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,092
That's the feeling we want to address
with this treatment.

154
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:35,131
Yeah. Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril
and help me get this face off.

155
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,233
Come on. You can do this.

156
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,269
You don't know what it's like
to feel completely frustrated.

157
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:45,775
To have a desire build up within you
and be denied any opportunity for release.

158
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,885
Yeah, sounds like a drag.

159
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,766
Okay, help me out here.
Why does he love this show so much?

160
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,940
Well, there was action, it was funny.

161
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,440
I mean, you do get that usually
the monster chases the pretty girl...

162
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:21,112
...but this time the pretty girl
chases the monsters?

163
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,345
Yippee, it's backwards, I get it.

164
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,487
Why does this bother you so much?

165
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,420
I don't know. It's just, he's so passionate
about so many different things.

166
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,651
I just don't get that way. Do you?

167
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,796
Well, sure.
I'm pretty passionate about science.

168
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:43,492
I remember the first time I looked through
a microscope and saw tiny microorganisms.

169
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,830
It was like a whole other universe.

170
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:50,338
If I wanted to, I could wipe it out
with my thumb like a god.

171
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,472
See, I wish I had
some of that fire in my life.

172
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,979
I wanna care about things
and get excited like you guys.

173
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,516
- There's no reason you can't.
- You think?

174
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,180
Absolutely. All we need to do is spend time
and find something you're passionate about.

175
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,687
Ugh, that sounds like a lot of work.

176
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:14,593
Hey, what's up?

177
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,825
Lucy's coming over. I need some advice.

178
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:20,870
However long you think
the foreplay should be, triple it.

179
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,776
Just tell me which one you think
is more manly.

180
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:30,539
This hockey jersey or this football jersey?

181
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,013
I don't know. Go with hockey.

182
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,518
Good, black is more slimming.

183
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,722
That's her. I gotta go be butch. Toodles.

184
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,061
- Hey. Come in.
- Hi.

185
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:54,699
- Aw. Look how cute your little doggie is.
- Yeah, I wouldn't get too close.

186
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,808
If I give the right command in German,
she'll rip your face off.

187
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:06,946
O'er the land of the free

188
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:12,216
And the home of the

189
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,585
Next.

190
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,927
That's an impressive layout, isn't it?

191
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,163
Yes.

192
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,436
Let's box it up.

193
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,245
Let's box it up.

194
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,081
That's enough.

195
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,487
- Sheldon, give it!
- No!

196
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,491
Okay, Sheldon,
make a wish and blow out the candles.

197
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,140
Oops. Missed one.
Now your wish can't come true.

198
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,271
Lucky for you,
because I wished you were dead.

199
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,953
- I like yourjersey.
- Thanks, I love hockey.

200
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,781
Cool, so does my dad.

201
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:20,117
We watched it all the time growing up.
Who's your favorite player?

202
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,633
Not Brian Boitano, that's for sure.

203
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,169
- How's your burrito?
- Still a little frozen in the middle.

204
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:38,469
Probably because I didn't read the instructions.
No wrapper's gonna tell me what to do.

205
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:41,202
Unless his name is Jay Z.

206
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,642
- Is something going on?
- What do you mean?

207
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,318
Well, you're acting all weird,
and I'm pretty weird...

208
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,317
...so I think I know what I'm talking about.

209
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:54,652
I don't know, maybe it's all those
steroids I've been taking.

210
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:59,486
I think I'm gonna go. Thank you
for the burrito and the pork rinds...

211
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:04,158
...and the 20-minute lecture on why
monster trucks are better than regular trucks.

212
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,735
Wait, wait.

213
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,536
I found your blog
where you wrote about me.

214
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,510
Oh. I just write that for myself.
I didn't think anybody actually read it.

215
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:19,412
No kidding. You didn't make it easy to find.
I spent hours digging around online.

216
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:24,216
For the record, you have excellent credit
and your diabetic aunt...

217
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,153
...seems to be adjusting to her new leg
just fine.

218
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,396
Why were you acting so strange tonight?

219
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,699
You called me "feminine."

220
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,528
I wanted you to think I was more manly.

221
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,398
Raj, I didn't say feminine was a bad thing.

222
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:44,269
I meant you're sweet and thoughtful
and your skin looks so much like caramel...

223
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,240
...I just want to dip an apple in your face.

224
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,681
I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall
moisturizing regimen.

225
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,709
So are you okay?

226
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:56,952
- Yeah.
- Good.

227
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,184
- Do you even like hockey?
- Heh. No.

228
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,796
I bought this at the Staples Center
when I went to see Taylor Swift.

229
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:12,832
So I was thinking how excited you get
about stuff like Buffy or science...

230
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,734
...or which TV remote
you and Sheldon should buy...

231
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,466
The Harmony One was fine.
We didn't need the 1100...

232
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,305
...which he knows is too big for my hand.

233
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,609
See, that's the kind of passion
I didn't think I had.

234
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,116
But then I realized
I'm passionate about you.

235
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:32,785
Oh. My cute little tushy strikes again.

236
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,754
I'm serious. I've always had these plans.
I was gonna be in movies...

237
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,660
...and live this glamorous life,
and anything less than that...

238
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:45,530
...wasn't worth getting excited about.
- Those things can still happen.

239
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,172
Obviously, it's gonna happen.
A psychic at a bachelorette party told me.

240
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:54,308
Anyway, what I meant was
I shouldn't wait, you know?

241
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,676
I've got you, I've got Sheldon...

242
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,748
...and all these wonderful friends.

243
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,943
My life is exciting right now.

244
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,957
- That's a big deal.
- It is, isn't it?

245
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,655
So does that mean we get to do stuff
like talk about cool shows...

246
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,995
...or get dressed up in matching costumes
and go to Comic-Con?

247
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,161
Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke.

248
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:28,374
Amy, I must say, I was skeptical at first...

249
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,413
...but this has truly been
a transformative evening.

250
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,175
I'm a little surprised to hear you
feeling so positive.

251
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:38,584
Well, you're an excellent neuroscientist,
you're a wonderful girlfriend...

252
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,348
...and...

253
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:47,230
- And?
- Doesn't matter, does it?

254
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,331
I'm proud of you, Sheldon.

255
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,533
And a complete sucker.

256
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,709
Oh, yeah.

257
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,285
There he is.

258
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,694
And the home of the brave

259
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,534
Don't stop. Yes, keep going.

260
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,138
Just like that.
Almost there. Almost there.

261
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,550
Sheldon, you big weirdo. I want you
to know I love that you're in my life.

262
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,911
I love you too.

263
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:55,489
Hello, is this the Bruce Miller
who wrote the season finale of Alphas?

264
00:18:56,335 --> 00:19:00,328
Oh, smashing. You already sound nicer
than the last Bruce Miller...

265
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:05,169
...who suggested I have sexual relations
with myself. Now, down to business.

266
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,242
Your show ended on a cliffhanger.

267
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,539
Could you please tell me
how you planned to resolve it?

268
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,411
Uh-huh.

269
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,915
Mm-hm.

270
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,586
I see.

271
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:20,816
Well, that all stinks.
No wonder you got canceled. Bye.

272
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,354
Ah.
