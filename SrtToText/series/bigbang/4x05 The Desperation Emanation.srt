you're suffocating me.

306
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,670
My apologies.

307
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:47,207
- Good night, Amy.
AMY: Good night, Sheldon.

308
00:17:48,611 --> 00:17:51,910
Come on, just give her a chance.
Maybe she'll grow on you.

309
00:17:52,115 --> 00:17:55,744
Or maybe she'll finally succeed
in ripping my nuts off.

310
00:17:57,387 --> 00:18:00,117
There's still 93 ways
she hasn't tried yet.

311
00:18:01,057 --> 00:18:02,718
Uh, Howard, I appreciate the effort...

312
00:18:02,892 --> 00:18:05,326
...but this is, like,
the worst date of my life.

313
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:06,985
Heh, seriously?

314
00:18:07,163 --> 00:18:10,189
I was once robbed by a pre-op
transsexual I met on JDate...

315
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:13,665
...and that didn't
even crack my top 10.

316
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,196
Well, I guess the difference is
I have some self-respect.

317
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:19,671
Not that I've ever seen.

318
00:18:19,842 --> 00:18:21,275
It's relatively new.

319
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:25,347
I just know I'm not gonna
spend time with someone I don't like...

320
00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:26,948
...simply to have a girlfriend.

321
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,549
I'm okay on my own.

322
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:32,210
Good news,
I made lots of room for dessert.

323
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:36,882
- Uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but, uh...
- Yeah, you too.

324
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,552
You got anything for next weekend?
I need a date for my cousin's wedding.

325
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,857
- You're asking me out?
JOY: Yeah.

326
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:47,093
And it's an open bar,
so I'll probably be giving it away.

327
00:18:49,472 --> 00:18:51,702
I'll look forward to it.

328
00:18:58,581 --> 00:19:00,981
MRS. FOWLER [OVER LAPTOP]:
It's nice to meet you too, Sheldon.

329
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,416
I honestly didn't believe Amy
when she told me she had a boyfriend.

330
00:19:05,955 --> 00:19:08,150
I assure you I am quite real...

331
00:19:08,324 --> 00:19:12,124
...and I'm having regular intercourse
with your daughter.

332
00:19:13,963 --> 00:19:15,954
- What?
- Oh, yes.

333
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:19,033
We are like wild animals in heat.

334
00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:22,261
It's a wonder
neither of us has been hurt.

335
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:26,331
Amy, what is he saying?

336
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:30,445
You wanted me to have a boyfriend,
mother. Well, here he is.

337
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:34,616
Have to sign off now.

338
00:19:34,784 --> 00:19:37,014
My hunger for Sheldon
is stirring in my loins.

339
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:42,279
Oh, yes. It's time for me to make love
to your daughter's vagina.

340
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,482
MRS. FOWLER:
Oh!

341
00:19:47,897 --> 00:19:51,333
- Thank you. That went very well.
- Agreed.

342
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:53,264
Amy, I find myself wondering...

343
00:19:53,436 --> 00:19:58,203
...if we should actually engage in coitus
at least one time in our relationship.

344
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:01,300
Buzzinga.

345
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:04,674
Bedtime,
please show yourself out.

346
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:32,864
