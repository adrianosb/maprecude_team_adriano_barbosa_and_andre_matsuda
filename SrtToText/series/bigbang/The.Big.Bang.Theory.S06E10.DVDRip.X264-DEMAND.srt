1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:07,329
Is anyone else troubled
by the Spider-Man theme song?

2
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,740
Why would it trouble you?
It's your third-favorite cartoon theme song.

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:16,279
It is, right behind,
"Do, do, do, do, do, Inspector Gadget."

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,110
And Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Heroes in a half shell.

5
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,220
Turtle power.

6
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:28,785
However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit
that Spider-Man, Spider-Man...

7
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:32,055
...does whatever a spider can.
- Yeah, so?

8
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:35,757
I can think of many things
Spider-Man can't do that a spider can.

9
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,164
One, crawl in your ear and die.

10
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:42,098
Two, legally leave Guatemala
without a passport.

11
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,468
And three, have sex with a spider.

12
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:50,980
Can we change the subject?
Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.

13
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,816
It's "heebie-jeebies."

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,887
I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic.

15
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,488
I was thinking we could have
a little film festival tonight.

16
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,458
The theme:
Movies that killed their franchises.

17
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:10,536
Oh.
Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.

18
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:14,500
Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous.

19
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:19,906
I mean, you know a movie's bad
when my homegirl Sandy B can't save it.

20
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,006
Penny's working tonight. I'm in.

21
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,674
Not me. I'm having dinner with Bernadette
and her parents.

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,650
- Fun. We know how much you love that.
- It's torture.

23
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,654
Especially with her dad.
We have nothing in common.

24
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,851
You know what I like to do
when I'm forced to speak with those...

25
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:38,428
...beneath my intellectual station?

26
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,462
I bring up an interesting topic...

27
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:44,728
...like the difference between
Spider-Man and spiders.

28
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,031
Thanks, Sheldon.
I'll try that with my father-in-law.

29
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,142
No, you can't use that one. That's mine.

30
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,709
Try this one for an icebreaker.

31
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,506
Uh, despite popular lore...

32
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:58,548
...there is no place in the continental
United States, Alaska or Hawaii...

33
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:03,017
...from which one can dig straight through
the center of the Earth and come up in China.

34
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,089
Great. Thank you.

35
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,395
Actually, you can't have that one either.
It's too good. Sorry.

36
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,565
What about you, Sheldon?
Do you have plans?

37
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:16,565
Sadly, yes. Amy's taking me
to a memorial service.

38
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,499
It's for one of her colleagues
who is of Asian descent...

39
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,834
...so my planned conversational gambit
is to casually remark...

40
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:28,105
...that no matter how deep they dig his grave,
he'll never make his way back to China.

41
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,510
That should lighten the mood.

42
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,483
What can I say, I put the "fun" in funeral.

43
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,877
Amy? Amy?

44
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,280
Oh, right, funeral.

45
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,045
Amy?

46
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:13,824
Hello, Sheldon.

47
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,221
I'm not allowed to wear
my Silver Surfer tie...

48
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,057
...but you can wear a bathrobe?

49
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,333
I think I'm too sick to go to the funeral.

50
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,430
You're sick? You poor kid.

51
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,468
Well, see you.

52
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,431
Sheldon, aren't you gonna take care of me?

53
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:33,476
Me? No, I'm not that kind of doctor.

54
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,575
But our relationship agreement
clearly states...

55
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,581
...when one of us is sick,
the other must take care of them.

56
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,277
Oh. I see the confusion.

57
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:47,983
The intent behind that clause
was to force you to take care of me when I'm ill.

58
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:52,289
When you're feeling better,
you'll think that's funny.

59
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,429
Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.

60
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,341
Amy? Amy? Amy?

61
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,712
I made a commitment in writing
to comfort you in times like this.

62
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:20,790
And, additionally, you are my girlfriend
and I care about your well-being.

63
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,795
- Thank you, Sheldon.
- You're welcome.

64
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,967
Now let's get this over with.

65
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,013
- So how have you been?
- Fine.

66
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,809
Good.

67
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,980
Fine is good.

68
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,722
- How are you liking retirement?
- It's fine.

69
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,135
I'm sensing a theme.

70
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:14,074
You ever really think about
the Spider-Man theme song?

71
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,646
How's that dinner coming?

72
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:23,520
- I just put it in. It's gonna be a while.
- I like rare chicken. Let's do this.

73
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:25,751
You could die.

74
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:35,100
Death by chicken. Ha, ha.
That's a pretty fowl way to go.

75
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,976
- Here's another beer, honey.
- Thank you.

76
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,237
So, Mrs. Rostenkowski,
you took that trip to the Grand Canyon.

77
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:52,077
- How was it?
- It was good.

78
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,690
Had no idea you were the chatty one.

79
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,431
One hundred two point two.

80
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:13,103
Exactly what it was half an hour ago.

81
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,738
It's like you're not even trying to get better.

82
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,209
Sheldon, you don't get over the flu
in half an hour.

83
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,904
Well, not with that attitude.

84
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:28,478
You know, I have to say,
I'm finding your bedside manner a little lacking.

85
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,918
I'm sorry. I just want you to get better
as soon as possible.

86
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:36,155
And with that goal in mind,
let me ask you a question.

87
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,796
Do you believe in the placebo effect?

88
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,229
Of course I do. There have been many studies
proving its validity.

89
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:47,372
Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac...

90
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:53,041
...but it is really a powerful medication
specifically designed...

91
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,771
...to cure your illness,
as well as freshen your breath.

92
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,949
Sheldon, this isn't helping.

93
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,984
Why don't you just let me get some rest?

94
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:05,180
How can you sleep?
I'm not done making you feel better.

95
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:09,885
I still have to put a cold rag on your head,
sing to you...

96
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,290
...and apply VapoRub to your chest.

97
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,299
You wanna rub something on my chest?

98
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,772
Yes. All over it.

99
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,309
Ahem. Maybe we should start with that.

100
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,482
Now you're being a responsible patient.

101
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:52,827
Now, you may notice some tingling.

102
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,606
Oh, I'm counting on it.

103
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,543
- Okay, dig in.
- Hold up.

104
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:11,384
Bless us, O Lord, for these thy gifts
which we are about to receive...

105
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,424
...from thy bounty through Christ our Lord,
amen.

106
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,695
Took the words right out of my mouth.

107
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,832
So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?

108
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,200
- I'm going next weekend.
- Oh. You like to fish?

109
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,902
Yes.

110
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,614
Sure. I can hear it in your voice.

111
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,951
If he didn't like it, he wouldn't go.

112
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,352
You know, I hadn't thought of that.

113
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,355
Help me.

114
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,492
Dad, maybe you could take Howard
fishing sometime.

115
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:56,395
- Give you a chance to get to know each other.
- No, no. We know each other well enough.

116
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,594
He's been talking my ear off all night.

117
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,171
Howie, I think you'd have fun.

118
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,939
- Fine. You can tag along.
- Terrific.

119
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,173
My two favorite fellas "gone fishing."

120
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:15,884
Hang on a second.
Bernie, next weekend we have that thing.

121
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,819
- What thing?
- You know, the thing.

122
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,493
Oh, that thing. No, I canceled that thing.

123
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,467
All right, it's settled.
You and I are going fishing.

124
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,933
Great. Heh. Thanks for the help.

125
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,833
I've never even been fishing.
This is gonna be a disaster.

126
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:40,911
If you don't want to look foolish
doing something, you should practice.

127
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,707
Do you know how many beef Wellingtons
I made by myself...

128
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,781
...before I invited you guys over?

129
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:53,023
I'll give you a hint.
You can see them here, here and here.

130
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,330
Raj is right. You should get someone
to give you some pointers.

131
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,124
Do you guys know how to fish?

132
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,625
- No.
- No.

133
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,306
But if you catch anything,
I know how to steam it in banana leaves.

134
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:13,301
Come on, we must know somebody
who can do manly stuff like this.

135
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,480
What's up?

136
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,757
Step one, worms.

137
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,218
Ew.

138
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,762
Okay, "ew" is one of the things you're not
gonna wanna say in front of your father-in-law.

139
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,971
It's right up there with
"icky" and "get it away."

140
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,336
- Now pick one up.
- Really?

141
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:46,272
- You're gonna have to do it when you're fishing.
- Okay.

142
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,176
What are you waiting for?

143
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,410
I don't know.
For them to die of natural causes?

144
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:58,045
Just pick up a worm
and put him on this hook.

145
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,492
Fine. Ahem.

146
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,198
There. Heh.

147
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:18,707
I'm no expert, but I think the hook
has to go through the worm.

148
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:20,803
Fine.

149
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,038
Sorry, Mr. Worm.

150
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,740
Sherm. Sherm the worm.

151
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,050
Hey, don't name him,
just jab a hook in his face.

152
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,724
- You got this, buddy.
- Yeah, come on. Hook that worm.

153
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,053
- You can do it.
- That's great.

154
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,025
Cheerleading. Way to man things up.

155
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:47,731
"...and the control group displayed
significantly fewer genetic abnormalities.

156
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:51,243
But because of flaws
in the experimental design...

157
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,674
...relating to environment and diet...

158
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:58,441
...they lived inconclusively ever after."
The end.

159
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:02,117
That was great. Rub my chest again.

160
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,614
No. I need to get you down for a nap.

161
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:09,454
And for some reason,
that VapoRub gets you all fired up.

162
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,864
- How's the poor thing?
- I'm hanging in there. Thanks for asking.

163
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,466
Hey, Amy, I brought you some drugs
we've been working on in the lab.

164
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,664
This is proving really good for congestion.

165
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,275
There's a chance
it can make tears burn like acid.

166
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,469
So if you take it, happy thoughts.

167
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,848
I'm gonna draw you a soothing bath.

168
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,451
- Where's your bath thermometer?
- I don't have a bath thermometer.

169
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,485
Fine, then I'm going to draw you...

170
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,182
...a nerve-wracking bath
of indeterminate temperature.

171
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,320
This is a really good expectorant.

172
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:49,126
Although, some test subjects reported lactating
uncontrollably when they heard music.

173
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,828
Okay, okay, here's the deal.
I don't need your medicine. I'm not sick.

174
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,834
- I don't understand.
- I got better two days ago.

175
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,406
It's just been so nice
having Sheldon take care of me.

176
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:05,549
- So you've just been lying to him?
- You see the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.

177
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,883
I don't mean to be judgy,
but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.

178
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,324
All right. I'll tell him.

179
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:21,262
Amy, would you be strong enough
to bathe yourself or do you need my help?

180
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,531
I'll tell him tomorrow.

181
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,638
Momma needs a bath.

182
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,675
Now, let's assume by some miracle
you actually catch a fish.

183
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:40,045
You're gonna have to know how to gut it.
So, what you're gonna do...

184
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:44,455
...is you're gonna take your knife,
slice him right up the belly.

185
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,093
- Do you want me to stop?
- No, I'm fine. Keep going.

186
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:55,563
You don't wanna cut too deep into his guts
or the blood will just squirt all over your face.

187
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,372
Oh, my God. What is with you guys?

188
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:06,170
Well, it's not our fault.
Our dads never did anything like this with us.

189
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:09,211
- What, never?
- My dad was an anthropologist.

190
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,076
The only father-son time he spent...

191
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:15,049
...was with a 2000-year-old skeleton
of an Etruscan boy.

192
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,244
I hated that kid.

193
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,616
Mine just took me to his gynecology office.

194
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:25,126
I got so bored, I'd put vaginal lubricant
at the bottom of my shoes...

195
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,891
...and pretend I was ice skating.

196
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,434
Yeah, well my quality father-son time
was spending my adolescence...

197
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:39,839
...Iooking out the window,
waiting for my dad to come back some day.

198
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,415
Yeah, okay, Howard wins.

199
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,843
We didn't have opportunities like this
when we were growing up...

200
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:51,853
...but right now there's a dad
that wants to take you on a fishing trip.

201
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,592
You're right. Ugh. I should do this.

202
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:56,784
Great. Ahem. Here you go.

203
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:01,524
Now what you do is, you stick your thumb
down its throat, grab the guts and pull.

204
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,166
Here we go.

205
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,040
Oh, look, it's a female.
You can see all the eggs.

206
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,659
Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you're back.

207
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,270
I've taken a turn for the worst.

208
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,697
I think I'm gonna need another bath.

209
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,668
I'm surprised to hear that.

210
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,576
You see, the other day,
I was concerned that you weren't recovering...

211
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,216
...so while you were sleeping,
I took a cheek swab...

212
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,080
...and had it cultured in the lab.

213
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,281
- Oh?
- I got the results back.

214
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,425
Have you developed any
of the following symptoms?

215
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:08,031
A growing nose or perhaps a warm sensation
in the trouser region?

216
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:12,535
Also known as full-blown
Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire.

217
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:16,572
All right, all right.
But I really was sick at the beginning.

218
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,937
It's just been so nice
having you take care of me.

219
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,015
It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy.

220
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,878
I thought our relationship
was based on trust...

221
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:31,113
...and a mutual admiration
that skews in my favor.

222
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,516
I feel terrible I did this.

223
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:37,890
It pains me to say it,
but I think some form of penalty is in order...

224
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,464
...so as to discourage this type of behavior
in the future.

225
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,464
I suppose that's fair. What do you suggest?

226
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:48,867
In a perfect world, I'd lock you in a stockade
in the public square.

227
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,035
And that probably requires a permit.

228
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,380
I could not be allowed to go to the opening
of the next Star Trek movie.

229
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:01,610
Oh, that seems overly harsh.

230
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,480
You gave in to a human weakness.
You didn't kill a man.

231
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,716
You know, it's a tad old-school...

232
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,624
...but my father was not one
to spare the rod...

233
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:17,268
...when my brother would sneak into his truck
and drink his driving whiskey.

234
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,900
Are you saying you wanna spank me?

235
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,870
I don't want to...

236
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,810
...but it looks like you left me no choice.

237
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,885
That's true.

238
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,252
I've been a very bad girl.

239
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,466
Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to fish we go.

240
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,998
- That's what you're wearing?
- No good?

241
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,936
The guy at the sporting goods store
said these are what fishermen wear.

242
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,468
Maybe in cartoons.

243
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:05,143
I wish I had known that before
I posted all those pictures on Facebook.

244
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:11,521
All right. Let's hit the road. I wouldn't mind
shooting some ducks in the morning.

245
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,055
Wait, now we're shooting things?

246
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,927
I like using a big shell.

247
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,428
You can't eat them afterwards
but it's fun watching them blow up.

248
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:31,303
Sir, I'm flattered that you invited me
and I really want you to like me...

249
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,846
...but I don't think this trip is the way to do it.

250
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:41,646
And I can't return these things
if there's chunks of duck all over them.

251
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:46,046
- So why'd you agree to come?
- Because Bernadette made me.

252
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:50,558
I tried to back out too.
My wife said I had to go.

253
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:54,994
Really? Your wife makes you do stuff?
You're a big, scary cop.

254
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,227
You're an astronaut
and your wife makes you do things...

255
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,200
...and she's only 4 feet tall.

256
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:09,343
So, what do we do now?
They expect us to go away for the weekend.

257
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,882
There's an Indian casino near Palm Springs.

258
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,360
You know how to shoot craps?

259
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,029
No, but I'm not a stranger to dice games.

260
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,495
I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School
Yahtzee champion.

261
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,064
I'll teach you how to play.

262
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,073
Really?

263
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,209
Thank you, sir.

264
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,582
Call me Mike.

265
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,318
Okay.

266
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:55,559
Boy, we're just married to
a couple of ball-busters, huh, Mike?

267
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,928
That's my wife and daughter
you're talking about.

268
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,569
Great couple of gals.

269
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,768
I wouldn't go that far.

270
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,704
Are you prepared to receive
your punishment?

271
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,787
One second. I wanna put on some music.

272
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,814
Why?

273
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,722
I don't wanna disturb the people next door
while you discipline me.

274
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,963
Very well, then.
Get over my knee. Let's begin.

275
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,676
Oh, my.

276
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:54,075
Excuse me. You're not supposed
to be enjoying this.

277
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,482
Then maybe you should spank me harder.

278
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,752
Maybe I will.
