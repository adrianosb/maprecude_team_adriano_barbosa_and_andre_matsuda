00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,355
Uh, as a matter of fact, l... l...
I can't. I can't. I can't do it.

310
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:04,496
Sure, you can. You're doing fine.
It's very believable.

311
00:17:05,397 --> 00:17:09,197
I'm sorry, Raj, but the truth is
I was with Priya last night.

312
00:17:09,368 --> 00:17:10,392
Don't listen to him.

313
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:14,369
He's lightheaded from all the whiskey
and pickled eggs in his system.

314
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,065
- What were you doing with Priya?
- I believe coitus.

315
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:20,439
But more importantly, if Leonard
had not abandoned his story...

316
00:17:20,612 --> 00:17:22,477
...would you have found it plausible?

317
00:17:22,648 --> 00:17:25,617
- Did you...? You slept with my sister?
- Yeah.

318
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:27,775
How could you? We had a pact.

319
00:17:27,953 --> 00:17:29,944
Excuse me, I think "She's my sister"...

320
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:32,750
...takes precedence over
a five-year-old pinkie swear.

321
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,753
May I point out in a parallel universe
your friends are saying:

322
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:39,159
"Maggie McGarry?
She sounds lovely."

323
00:17:40,032 --> 00:17:42,728
Now, I admit it,
I may have crossed a line here.

324
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:45,961
But come on, Raj.
Your sister is a grown woman.

325
00:17:46,138 --> 00:17:49,039
And to her,
I'm a forbidden piece of white chocolate.

326
00:17:50,476 --> 00:17:53,104
I don't believe it.
This is a betrayal of my trust.

327
00:17:53,278 --> 00:17:56,611
No, no, no. Would it help if I told you
that I offered her my heart...

328
00:17:56,782 --> 00:17:59,080
...and she kind of stomped on it?

329
00:17:59,918 --> 00:18:01,909
How hard did she stomp?

330
00:18:02,788 --> 00:18:03,812
Very hard.

331
00:18:05,157 --> 00:18:06,784
Okay, I'm good.

332
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:13,762
Okay, well, Raj, I just wanna say
that I'd never betray your trust.

333
00:18:13,932 --> 00:18:16,264
Unlike Leonard, I respect you.

334
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:18,632
- Really?
HOWARD: Mm-hm.

335
00:18:19,972 --> 00:18:22,304
Was it out of respect
that you didn't tell Raj...

336
00:18:22,474 --> 00:18:25,602
...about the time you dropped
his iPhone in a urinal?

337
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:28,780
Dude, I put that thing on my face.

338
00:18:28,947 --> 00:18:31,541
I think a more amusing violation
of Raj's trust...

339
00:18:31,717 --> 00:18:33,344
...is when Howard convinced him...

340
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,919
...that foreigners give presents
to Americans on Thanksgiving.

341

[CHUCKLES]

342

Hey, I didn't see you giving back
your Snoopy Sno-Cone maker.

343
00:18:42,694 --> 00:18:45,822
Wait, that was all a lie?
This year's gifts are already wrapped.

344
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:47,363
As long as we're talking...

345
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:50,730
...how about the month Sheldon spent
grinding up insects...

346
00:18:50,903 --> 00:18:52,734
...and mixing them
into Leonard's food?

347
00:18:52,905 --> 00:18:55,738
Well, excuse me.
That was not a betrayal.

348
00:18:55,908 --> 00:18:57,375
- Oh.
- That was an experiment...

349
00:18:57,543 --> 00:19:02,037
...to determine at what concentration
food starts tasting mothy.

350
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:05,042
You put moths in my food?

351
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:08,478
For science.

352
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:11,485
I can't believe you kissed my sister
with moth mouth.

353
00:19:11,657 --> 00:19:15,718
Well, uh... I can't believe you'd use
Sheldon's toothbrush.

354
00:19:15,894 --> 00:19:18,089
You used my toothbrush?

355
00:19:18,263 --> 00:19:21,027
Not the brush part.
Just the little rubber thing...

356
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,636
...to pick food from my teeth
and massage my gums.

357
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,178
Okay, l... I think it's safe to say...

358
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:36,508
...that we've all done some things
we're not particularly proud of.

[SCOFFS]

But come on, we're friends.

361
00:19:40,185 --> 00:19:42,676
Friends overlook each other's
minor lapses.

362
00:19:44,189 --> 00:19:46,851
For the record, Howard,
I'm sorry that I broke our pact.

363
00:19:47,793 --> 00:19:49,260
Thank you.

364
00:19:49,428 --> 00:19:53,762
And I'm sorry about your phone
and Thanksgiving.

365
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:58,397
And while we're at it, you don't have to
wash our clothes on the 4th of July.

366
00:19:59,738 --> 00:20:04,368
As long as we're apologizing, Sheldon,
I'm sorry I used your toothbrush.

00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:06,400
And I'm sorry...

368
00:20:06,578 --> 00:20:09,911
...but that behavior is beyond the pale
and cannot be tolerated.

369
00:20:10,082 --> 00:20:11,982
We are no longer friends.

370
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:15,983
I got you a talking Thomas
the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.

371
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:18,988
With real puffing smoke?

00:20:19,324 --> 00:20:20,757
Yes.

373
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:23,294
All right.

374
00:20:24,963 --> 00:20:26,328
But I'm watching you.

Can I have a snow cone?

Well, sure.
