1
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,205
What are you drawing over there?

2
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:10,571
A hypothetical containment field
for a Frisbee-sized wormhole...

3
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:13,406
...that could serve as a portal
to a parallel universe.

4
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:16,845
Oh, you silly doodlebug.

5
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:21,278
A lot of scientists believe
making contact with other life-forms...

6
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,615
...would probably not end well for us.

7
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,688
It's a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard.

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,123
You could block it with a Frisbee.
Calm down.

9
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,790
Do you expect me to build this? Heh.

10
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:37,198
I expect you to wipe the pudding
off your chin. Gentlemen.

11
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:43,132
Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon
always disappears every day at 2:45?

12
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,573
- Really?
- He probably just goes to the bathroom.

13
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,543
Actually, no. He goes at 8 a.m.
With optional follow-ups...

14
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,651
...at 1:45 and 7:10 on high-fiber Fridays.

15
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,414
It's sad that you know that.

16
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,455
Oh...
That's just the tip of the sadness iceberg.

17
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,618
I'm looking at his public calendar.

18
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,731
Two-forty-five to 3:05, nothing.

19
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,163
Yesterday, 2:45 to 3:05, nothing.

20
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,928
Last week, nothing. Last month, nothing.

21
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,664
He never has anything booked
during that time.

22
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:16,671
Twenty minutes a day
completely unaccounted for.

23
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:20,505
- We should figure out where he goes.
- Ooh, this is exciting.

24
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:24,514
Like one of my classic
murder-mystery dinner parties.

25
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:29,815
Right, the case of who murdered
three Saturday nights of my life.

26
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:33,288
Colonel Koothrappali in the kitchen
with the olive spread.

27
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,888
It was tapenade and you guys suck.

28
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:05,984
So how was work today?

29
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,526
Well, I spent most of the afternoon
growing isotopically pure crystals...

30
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,721
...for neutrino detection.

31
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,491
That sounds like fun.

32
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:19,330
- Yeah, it was.
- Oh, good, I guessed right.

33
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:24,104
- Who you talking to?
- Oh, just this guy I met at school.

34
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:27,007
Oh, great. We're still dating, right?

35
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:32,208
Relax, he's just a friend. We're doing
an oral report together. He's really nice.

36
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:35,718
I'm sorry, what was that?
I had a little stroke after "oral."

37
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:37,988
Would you stop?

38
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,724
He moved here from London.
He doesn't know anybody.

39
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:45,729
Oh, good, an English accent,
the sexiest accent you can have.

40
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,457
No, that's not true.

41
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,467
There's French, there's Italian.

42
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,901
No, you're right, it's the best.

43
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,402
- Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?
- It didn't come up.

44
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,134
Maybe you should tell him.

45
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,903
What am I supposed to say?

46
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,570
Say, "Can't talk right now.
Hanging with my boyfriend.

47
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,547
England sucks, you suck,
U.S.A. Number one."

48
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:13,723
Fine. "Hanging with my boyfriend.
Talk to you later."

49
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,360
- Happy?
- Yes. Thank you.

50
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,620
Mm-hm.

51
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,357
Huh.

52
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,266
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

53
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:26,530
What?

54
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,539
"Did your boyfriend make you type that?"

55
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:38,742
I hate this guy.

56
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:45,389
- Don't be like that.
- Oh, come on. Trust me, he's hitting on you.

57
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,186
He's not, we're just friends.
Is this gonna be a problem?

58
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,625
He's supposed to come over
tomorrow to work.

59
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:51,957
Really? Here?

60
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,965
If it makes you uncomfortable, I'll switch
partners even though the thing's due...

61
00:03:56,135 --> 00:04:00,094
...and everyone already has a partner
and I'll probably end up failing the class.

62
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,570
That'd be great. Thank you.

63
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,476
Two forty-four. Right on schedule.

64
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:09,979
Hey, Sheldon.

65
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,946
Oh, hello.

66
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:16,282
Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab
to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny.

67
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,120
- Wanna come with us?
- No, thank you.

68
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:24,161
You sure? They turn off the lights and it's
like a little laser show that poops all over.

69
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,623
I'm quite sure. Good day.

70
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,790
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

71
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,663
- We told you.
- Yeah, I just told you.

72
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,829
- No, you didn't.
- Your word against mine. See you in court.

73
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,937
- Should we follow him?
- I don't know. I'm torn.

74
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,708
I want to know where he's going but
now I kind of want to play with the bunny.

75
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,512
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Alex.

76
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,678
- Do you know where your boss just went?
- No.

77
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,416
- Don't you know his schedule?
- All I know is corduroy...

78
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,492
...makes too much noise
and I have to go find quieter pants.

79
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,325
Come on.

80
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:06,029
Boy, what I wouldn't give
to get her out of those pants.

81
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:09,174
And into something a little more stylish.

82
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,380
This is where he goes?

83
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,186
- What's in there?
- I think it's an old storage room.

84
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:32,731
What could he be doing in there every day
for 20 minutes?

85
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,628
Well, he's not doing 20-minute abs...

86
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,565
...because if he were,
he'd have way better abs.

87
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,405
- Can you hear anything?
- Not yet.

88
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,889
What are you doing?

89
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,253
I'm listening.

90
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:04,487
Can't you face the other way and listen?

91
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,598
I can't do anything right for you, can I?

92
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,768
What the hell is he up to?

93
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,397
He is kind of a weirdo.

94
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,735
Maybe he's got Leonard Nimoy
chained up in there.

95
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,706
Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.

96
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,471
Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?

97
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:27,911
Howard, you can't treat the man differently
just because he's disabled. That's not okay.

98
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,619
If you're wondering why I've been staring...

99
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,957
...I'm trying to get a look at this guy
who's coming over to Penny's.

100
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,091
To be honest, I didn't know you were here.

101
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,769
It's not a big deal.
He's just in her history class.

102
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,634
They're working on a project.
I don't even know why I care.

103
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,300
- You know what, I don't care.
- You think you don't care.

104
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,945
This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.

105
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,346
Oh, I don't know.

106
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:04,453
Hey, statistically speaking, I'm sure
you have something to worry about.

107
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:06,716
What do you mean?

108
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:10,954
Well, if we assume
that your looks are average...

109
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,793
...right off the bat, 50 percent of men on
Earth are more attractive than you.

110
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,902
That's 1.5 billion handsome lads
standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.

111
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,175
Well, yeah, but this isn't just about looks.

112
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,247
I'm way above average
in a lot of other things.

113
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:35,854
Not height, vision, athleticism,
or ability to digest dairy products.

114
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:40,553
I'm talking about important things
like emotional maturity.

115
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:44,423
You were just spying on your girlfriend
through a peephole.

116
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,600
I liked it better
when you thought I wasn't here.

117
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,497
I'm not saying
you don't have attractive qualities.

118
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,231
Your choice of friends is impeccable.

119
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,840
You're a good sleeper.

120
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:01,378
And last but not least,
you buy the grapes I like.

121
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,581
You're a real catch compared
to some snoring guy...

122
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:08,618
...with a fridge full of lousy grapes.

123
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:10,880
None of this matters.

124
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,686
I trust that Penny cares about me
and nothing's gonna happen with this guy.

125
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:18,024
Unless of course he's a skilled hypnotist.

126
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,725
What?

127
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:24,063
While unlikely,
it's still a statistical possibility.

128
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:29,334
She might be performing sexual acts
with him and not even know it.

129
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,802
- Now you're just being ridiculous.
- Am I?

130
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,744
The mind's a mysterious thing, Leonard.

131
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,884
He could be having the time of his life...

132
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,747
...while she thinks she's a chicken
pecking for corn.

133
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:58,861
Look at us, sneaking around in the middle
of the night like a couple of cat burglars.

134
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,239
I think we're more like ninjas.

135
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,433
I don't wanna be a ninja.
I wanna be a cat burglar.

136
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,874
- Fine. I'll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.
- No, we both have to be the same thing.

137
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:14,612
Okay, we're ninjas.

138
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,116
Thank you.

139
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,183
But next time we'll be cat burglars.

140
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,295
- It's locked.
- Are you sure?

141
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,795
Yes, I'm sure.

142
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,460
Now, you stand guard, I'm...

143
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,469
It's locked.

144
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:42,375
Just keep an eye out.
I'll have this open in a minute.

145
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,311
When did you learn how to pick locks?

146
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:47,941
When I was starting to do magic
in junior high...

147
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,385
...I thought I could be an escape artist
like Harry Houdini.

148
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,320
- How did that work out?
- Pretty good.

149
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:58,623
I managed to escape friends, popularity,
and every party thrown in a 12-mile radius.

150
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,725
- There. Ready?
- Hold on, hold on.

151
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:02,958
What?

152
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,969
Sheldon is a very smart man, and
he obviously wants to keep this a secret.

153
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,663
Yeah, so?

154
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:11,674
What if it's booby-trapped?

155
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,706
Don't worry, I'm one step ahead of him.

156
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,246
Oh, great, what's your pl...?

157
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,016
Are we good?

158
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,514
Yeah.

159
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:33,996
Huh.

160
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,032
Forty-three.

161
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,670
What the hell does that mean?

162
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,328
I don't know.

163
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,873
- The solution to an equation?
- Maybe.

164
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,908
It's a prime number.

165
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,945
Encryption systems are built
on prime numbers.

166
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:52,607
What kind of secret
does Sheldon have to encrypt?

167
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:57,381
He's always been very cagey about what
he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.

168
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,461
It's paprika.

169
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,891
Really?

170
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,931
Well, okay, one mystery solved.

171
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,563
- Okay, good night.
- Thanks, Cole. See you at school.

172
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,206
See you.

173
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,870
I'll be right back.

174
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,240
I thought you left a long time ago.

175
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,747
What's up?

176
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,561
Hey.

177
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,425
You, uh, moving into the apartment
on the fifth floor?

178
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,930
No. I was just visiting a friend.

179
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,125
Oh, cool.

180
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,827
- That cute blond on 4?
- Yeah. You know her?

181
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,598
Oh, well, I see her around.

182
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:53,768
I like to keep my distance
because her boyfriend's a pretty scary dude.

183
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,847
- Really?
- Yeah.

184
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,074
He's ganged up.

185
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,250
She told me he's a scientist.

186
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,550
That's the name of his gang.

187
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,291
The Scientists.

188
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,293
They are crazy.

189
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,968
- Well, thanks for the tip.
- No problem, brother. Stay frosty.

190
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,107
We're still dating, right?

191
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,696
- Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.
- Oh, hey, Alex.

192
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,298
And call me Leonard.
Dr. Hofstadter is my father.

193
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,626
And my mother.

194
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,031
And my sister.

195
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,967
And our cat.

196
00:12:55,474 --> 00:13:00,207
Although, I'm pretty sure Dr. Boots
Hofstadter's degree was honorary.

197
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,181
- May I join you, Leonard?
- Sure.

198
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,748
Thanks.

199
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,213
Hey, Alex, let me ask you something.

200
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,981
My girlfriend knows this guy at school.
He's got an English accent...

201
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,921
Ooh, I love English accents.

202
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,491
Yeah, you all do.

203
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,691
Anyway, I feel like he's hitting on her.

204
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,493
She says he's just being nice
and I should trust her.

205
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,499
It's probably harmless.

206
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,128
You know how it is.
I'm sure you get hit on all the time.

207
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,840
Right.

208
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:36,011
Because girls are always like,
"Ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms...

209
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:40,175
...and gets a lot of ear infections.
I gotta get me some of that."

210
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,086
I don't know.
Bet it happens more than you realize.

211
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,518
Trust me, it doesn't.

212
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,022
You sure?

213
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,922
You're cute, you're funny.

214
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,927
Maybe you're getting hit on
and you don't even know it.

215
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,697
Really?

216
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,530
I'm pretty sure.

217
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:08,278
Okay, I gotta get back to work.
Thanks for listening.

218
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:13,214
- No problem.
- Hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.

219
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:19,048
Come on, we're smart guys.

220
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,420
- We can figure this out.
- Forty-three.

221
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,721
What is 43?

222
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:27,332
Besides my mom's neck size.

223
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,896
It's the atomic number for technetium.

224
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,204
That stuff's radioactive.

225
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,570
Do you think he's building a bomb?

226
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:41,008
It took him two years to put together
that Lego Death Star. I'm not worried.

227
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,581
Ooh, this could be something.

228
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:50,586
Forty-three is the number of calories
in half a cup of fat-free yogurt.

229
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,084
Why would you know that?

230
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,923
I'm sorry, we can't all eat whatever we want
and still stay thin.

231
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,232
Wait. In The Hitchhikers Guide
to the Galaxy...

232
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,964
...isn't 43 the answer to the question of life,
the universe, and everything?

233
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,938
That's 42, dumb-ass.

234
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,936
Hey, hey.

235
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,739
Feelings.

236
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,473
We should stop. I'm exhausted.

237
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,051
Yeah, me too.
We've got more important things to do.

238
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,777
Who cares what stupid 43 means?

239
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,855
- Not me.
- Let's go home.

240
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,618
- Want to get something to eat?
- Sounds good.

241
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:36,256
- What the balls is 43?
- I have to know.

242
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,732
Hi.

243
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,035
Hey. Shouldn't you be out with your gang...

244
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,475
...spray-painting equations
on the side of buildings?

245
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,649
- Come on, I'm sorry.
- I just can't believe you don't trust me.

246
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,308
No, I do. Of course I do.

247
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:58,650
Then why did you embarrass me in front of
my friend? Who knew exactly who you were.

248
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:02,089
- Really?
- Your picture's on my refrigerator.

249
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,823
You know, I'm really starting
to not like this guy.

250
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:10,726
What is your problem?

251
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:14,430
Do you use up your thinking at work
and have none left for home?

252
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,005
I don't know.

253
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,541
It's hard sometimes.

254
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,542
Everywhere you go, guys hit on you.

255
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,772
Even if I'm standing right there.

256
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,611
And they're all taller than me.
Why is everyone taller than me?

257
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,919
You know what, this is all in my head.

258
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,522
It's my problem, not yours.

259
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,385
Leonard, why do you always do this?

260
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,392
Listen to me. You are the one I'm with.
You know I love you.

261
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,258
So will you please relax
because you're driving me crazy.

262
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,231
You know, that's the first time you ever said
that you love me.

263
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,576
Yeah.

264
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,142
We're just supposed to pretend
it's not a big deal?

265
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:06,083
That's exactly what we're gonna do...

266
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,819
...because you're about to make me cry.

267
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:14,898
And we both know if I start crying
you're gonna start crying.

268
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:20,000
- You're right, you should go.
- All right.

269
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,743
She loves me.

270
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,946
"Hey, it's Alex.
Nice having coffee with you.

271
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:41,582
If you want to talk more, I'm always available."
Smiley face, smiley face.

272
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,921
What a friendly girl.

273
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,665
Okay, picture's up.
Looks like the camera's working.

274
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,202
That's good-quality video.

275
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,602
It better be.
It's the spare camera for the Mars Rover.

276
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,470
How did you get your hands on that?

277
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,443
Million-dollar camera. Ten-dollar lock.

278
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,346
Oh, my God, here he comes. This is it.

279
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,663
- What the hell is that thing?
- I don't know.

280
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,321
This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

281
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:23,024
Experimental log.

282
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:27,036
Wormhole generator, test 44.

283
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,936
Wormhole-generator test?

284
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:39,978
The first 43 parallel universes I've checked
proved to be empty.

285
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:45,021
I see no reason to suspect universe
number 44 will be any different.

286
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:54,688
- Oh, my God!
- Holy crap!

287
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,033
Ow! It's eating my face!

288
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,735
It's eating his face!

289
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,248
I found your webcam
and replaced the video feed.

290
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,580
You two should be ashamed of yourselves.

291
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,588
- Sheldon, we're really sorry.
- Yeah, really sorry.

292
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:20,782
Sorry?

293
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:25,760
You may not realize it, but I have difficulty
navigating certain aspects of daily life.

294
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:30,061
You know, understanding sarcasm.
Feigning interest in others.

295
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,902
Not talking about trains
as much as I want to.

296
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,698
It's exhausting.

297
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:39,935
Which is why, for 20 minutes a day,
I like to go down to that room...

298
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,639
...turn my mind off,
and do what I need to do to recharge.

299
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,746
But what are you doing in there?

300
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,386
And what does 43 mean?

301
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,250
You don't need to know,
you don't deserve to know...

302
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,789
...and you will never know.

303
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:58,023
Yeah, well, I know how to make
your egg salad now.

304
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,167
One, two, three, four...

305
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:50,680
...five, six, seven, eight... Drat.

306
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:56,182
I'm never gonna get to 43 again.

307
00:20:56,355 --> 00:21:01,884
One, two, three, four... Rats.
