The same thing that happened
to Homo erectus.

00:18:13,115 --> 00:18:16,278
Mommy, Daddy,
you remember Rajesh's friend Leonard.

311
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:18,646
I thought Rajesh was out
with his friends.

312
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,913
Oh, he has many friends.

313
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:22,488
Rajesh has many friends?

314
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:26,420
Why are you lying to us?

315
00:18:26,762 --> 00:18:28,662
She doesn't want you to know
we're dating.

316
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,661
- Leonard.
- What difference does it make?

317
00:18:30,832 --> 00:18:33,892
If you're moving back to India,
we're obviously breaking up.

318
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:37,167
You know what?
I don't wanna deal with this right now.

319
00:18:45,314 --> 00:18:49,114
So... hot in India?

320
00:18:50,152 --> 00:18:53,053
Of course it is. It always is. It's India.

321
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,658
Now, what do you have
to say for yourself?

322
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:58,554
Uh...

323
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:00,957
That is a beautiful tapestry.

324
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,160
Oh, God.

325
00:19:42,104 --> 00:19:44,265
Oh, God.

326
00:19:45,173 --> 00:19:46,504
Ugh.

327
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:51,612
Okay, look, this never happened.
Do you understand me?

328
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,577
Really? Still can't talk to me?

329
00:20:00,722 --> 00:20:02,246
What are you doing here?

330
00:20:02,824 --> 00:20:05,292
- What?
- I said, what are you doing here?

331
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,518
I live here.

332
00:20:07,362 --> 00:20:09,956
I have paperwork that says differently.

00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:15,626
- Priya's going back to India.
- Irrelevant.

335
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,566
Rajesh and I have a good thing going
and you're not going to ruin it.

336
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,273
What are you doing here?

337
00:20:26,381 --> 00:20:28,679
Been up all night.
I had a fight with Bernadette.

338
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,078
Why?

339
00:20:30,252 --> 00:20:33,187
She gave me a beautiful watch.

340
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,321
Leonard, do you understand this?

341
00:20:37,993 --> 00:20:40,325
- Yes.
- Talk to him.

342
00:20:49,771 --> 00:20:51,500
Damn.

343
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:53,738
What's going on?

344
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:55,843
Oh, heh. No. No.

345
00:20:56,011 --> 00:20:58,377
It's not what it looks like. No.

346
00:21:01,883 --> 00:21:04,147
What does it look like?
