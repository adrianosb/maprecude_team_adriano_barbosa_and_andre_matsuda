Sure.

112
00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:06,699
It's inappropriate for a single woman
to entertain a man in private.

113
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:09,244
If you insist on talking,
do it on the couch.

All right, you may talk in the bedroom,
but I want this door to remain open.

Just this once you may close the door.

116

But keep in mind I'll be right out here

Very nice of you,
but I made other plans.

124

Why are you holding hands?
I forbid you to hold hands.

128

Rajesh, you know Leonard and I
spent the night together.

129
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:24,517
Yeah, but you were just sleeping
because I forboded you to have sex.

130
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:27,513
The word is forbade.

131
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:30,786
You sure? That doesn't sound right.

132
00:08:30,962 --> 00:08:34,420
Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I
decided to see each other again...

133
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:38,932
...and you don't get to tell me who I can
or can't have a relationship with.

134
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:40,297
Actually, he can.

135
00:08:40,471 --> 00:08:44,874
The Hindu Code of Manu
is very clear in these matters.

136
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:47,135
If a woman's father is not around...

137
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:49,506
...the duty of controlling
her base desires...

138
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,844
...falls to the closest male member
of her family, in this case, Raj.

139
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:57,181
The code also states
that if she disobeys...

140
00:08:57,355 --> 00:09:03,021
...she will be reborn in the womb
of a jackal and tormented by diseases.

141
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:10,066
If true, that seems like an awfully large
gamble, given that the prize is Leonard.

142
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:18,006
There it is, Priya. We're Indian.
We believe this stuff.

143
00:09:19,844 --> 00:09:21,903
It also says that if you eat beef...

144
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:25,981
...you need to live with cows
for three months and drink their urine.

145
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:27,978
Some makes sense, some is crazy.

146
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:31,087
My point is
you can't go out with Leonard.

147
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:33,821
- Who can't go out with Leonard?
- My sister.

148
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:36,391
Penny, this is Raj's sister, Priya.

149
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,085
- It's very nice to meet you.
- Oh, yeah. You too.

150
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:43,097
Priya, if you're experiencing
any tension or awkwardness...

151
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:46,259
...it may stem from the fact
that Leonard and Penny used to...

152
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,906
...if I may quote Howard,
"Do the dance with no pants."

153
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:57,543
- Sheldon.
- Really?

I smell Chinese food.

00:19:16,106 --> 00:19:19,769
It's actually Thai. You're slipping.

How about Howard?
