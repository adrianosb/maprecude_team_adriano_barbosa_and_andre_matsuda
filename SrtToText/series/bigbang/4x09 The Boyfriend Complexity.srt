As usual, you're all wrong.

7

Bravest person in the Marvel Universe
is the doctor...

...who gives Wolverine his prostate exam.

9

What about the guy who gets
a prostate exam from Wolverine?

10

Now you're just being silly.

...while the first elevator was not installed
until 1852.

Are you sure you have enough comics?

40

You're monitoring the telescope

...you've only selected seven hours
of reading material.

42

That's even factoring in your difficulty...

...in parsing American comic-book idioms
like "Bamf" and "Snikt."

I don't care
for novelty editions of Monopoly.

50

I prefer the classics, regular and Klingon.

51

Actually,
Indian Monopoly's just like regular.

52

Except the money's in rupees,
instead of hotels you build call centers...

You went out in the hallway,
stumbled into a portal...

...which brought you 5000 years
into the future...

...where you took advantage
of the technology to build a time machine.

Well, who would ever guess that?

- A big kiss, on the mouth.

in the hopes that you'll call 911."

Penny kissing me is not insane.
She used to kiss me all the time.

75
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:36,557
Einstein defined insanity as doing
the same thing over and over again...

307
00:17:12,124 --> 00:17:15,184
I thought we were past the days
when you'd pull the wool over my eyes.

308
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:18,660
Telling me the baggie
in your underwear drawer is potpourri.

309
00:17:20,232 --> 00:17:23,360
And the pee stick in your bathroom
is to check for diabetes.

310
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:28,901
I know. I'm sorry.

311
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:31,702
I respect your right
to make your own decisions...

312
00:17:31,877 --> 00:17:35,108
...but all I ask is you respect me enough
to be honest about them.

313
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:37,908
You're right.
From now on, I will tell you the truth.

314
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,141
Thank you.
Now go and put some clothes on.

315
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,617
We'll grab a bite
before I head for the airport.

316
00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:44,254
- Okay.
- Now you...

317
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,651
- He had nothing to do... Okay.
- Keep walking.

318
00:17:50,663 --> 00:17:53,757
Please, please,
please don't give up on her.

319
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:57,258
What?

320
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,495
I can't go back to the skateboard idiots,
the white rappers...

321
00:18:00,673 --> 00:18:04,165
...and all the sweaty dumb-asses
with their backwards hats.

322
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:08,273
Gee, I don't know if it's in the cards, sir.

323
00:18:08,514 --> 00:18:09,776
Then stack the deck.

324
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:13,518
Cheat, lie, I don't care.

325
00:18:13,686 --> 00:18:18,089
I want grandkids and I want them
to grow up in a house without wheels.

326
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:26,292
- I'll give it a shot.
- Thank you.

327
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:29,867
Now, I'm gonna do something here
to help you along.

328
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:31,434
- Excuse me?
- Just don't panic.

329
00:18:31,603 --> 00:18:34,037
[YELLING] Now get your sorry,
lying ass out of my face...

330
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:36,265
...and make sure I never see it again.

331
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:39,603
Oh, the reverse-psychology thing.
I see, that's very clever.

332
00:18:39,812 --> 00:18:42,212
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Don't yap. Just get out.

333
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:44,314
I'll friend you on Facebook.

334
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:53,416
Oh, there you are.

335
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,457
Just so you know, I was up all night...

336
00:18:55,627 --> 00:18:58,562
...but I've finally completed
the Penny-specific section...

337
00:18:58,731 --> 00:19:00,824
...of the new Roommate Agreement.

338
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,334
Yeah? Well, not necessary,
we broke up again.

339
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:19,745
Do you even think about other people,
Leonard?

340
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:24,421
Do you?

341
00:19:31,196 --> 00:19:32,925
Hey. Oh, how did it go last night?

342
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:37,834
Oh, you know. Same old, same old.

343
00:19:38,003 --> 00:19:41,029
Looked through a telescope,
saw some stars, big whoop.

344
00:19:41,673 --> 00:19:44,267
Really? You waited months
for time with that telescope.

345
00:19:44,443 --> 00:19:46,911
- What happened?
- Why, you writing a book?

346
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:50,012
I'm going to propose a hypothesis.

347
00:19:50,182 --> 00:19:54,516
Last night, Raj accidentally made
contact with an alien civilization...

348
00:19:55,854 --> 00:19:59,654
...and has been ordered by the
U.S. Government to keep it a secret.

349
00:20:01,293 --> 00:20:03,523
Nothing happened.
Can we change the subject?

350
00:20:03,729 --> 00:20:06,527
That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.

351
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:09,928
HOWARD: Hey.
SHELDON: Hello.

352
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:11,959
- Hey.
- Hey.

353
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:16,970
Did you get to play
with Raj's big telescope last night?

354
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:19,904
- Wha...?
- Wha...?

355
00:20:20,312 --> 00:20:24,271
- Where did that come from?
- He never touched my telescope.

356
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:27,077
- Way to go shutting up.
- I did shut up. Now you shut up.

357
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:29,117
- Fine.
- Thank you.

358
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:36,325
I can't believe
you didn't call me this morning.

359
00:21:03,956 --> 00:21:05,947
