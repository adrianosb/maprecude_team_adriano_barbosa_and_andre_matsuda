1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:04,410
- Penny, hello.
- Hey, Sheldon.

2
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:07,212
What is shaking?

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:10,450
I'm sorry?

4
00:00:10,627 --> 00:00:12,925
It's colloquial. A conversation opener.

5
00:00:14,497 --> 00:00:16,897
So do you find the weather satisfying?

6
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:20,935
Are you currently sharing in the triumph
of some local sports team?

7
00:00:21,638 --> 00:00:24,436
PENNY: What's wrong with you?
You're freaking me out.

8
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:27,599
I'm striking up a casual conversation
with you.

9
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,608
What's up?

10
00:00:34,217 --> 00:00:36,117
Please don't do that.

11
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:40,117
But I'm given to understand that when
you have something awkward to discuss...

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,020
...it's more palatable
to preface it with banal chitchat.

13
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,456
So this wasn't the awkward part?

14
00:00:49,432 --> 00:00:51,059
No.

15
00:00:52,836 --> 00:00:55,066
Oh. All right.

16
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:57,206
What's up?

17
00:00:58,508 --> 00:01:00,976
SHELDON:
Oh, good, I used that right.

18
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:05,539
Anyway, you're aware that Leonard has
entered into a new romantic relationship...

19
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:08,513
...which includes a sexual component.

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,153
- Okay, feeling the awkward now.
- Wait.

21
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,416
Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett.

22
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:19,926
And she's a highly distinguished
surgical resident at Fremont Memorial.

23
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:21,256
- Yeah, Leonard told me.
- Good.

24
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:26,232
What he may have left out
is how important this relationship is to me.

25
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:28,828
- To you?
- Yes.

26
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,940
See, of the handful of women
Leonard's been involved with...

27
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:35,077
...she's the only one
I have ever found tolerable.

28
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:41,444
Well, what about me?

29
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:44,482
The statement stands for itself.

30
00:01:46,723 --> 00:01:48,054
Well, aren't you sweet?

31
00:01:48,224 --> 00:01:50,556
Anyway, should you have
any interaction with her...

32
00:01:50,727 --> 00:01:55,096
...it would be most helpful
that she not see you as a sexual rival.

33
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:58,696
PENNY:
Yeah, I think she's pretty safe.

34
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,837
You say that now,
but consider the following scenario.

35
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:04,940
You're sitting in your apartment.
It's late. You're alone.

36
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:08,669
Your hypothalamus is swimming in
a soup of estrogen and progesterone...

37
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:14,147
...and, suddenly, even Leonard
seems like a viable sexual candidate.

38
00:02:15,952 --> 00:02:20,321
Or a hookup,
as it's referred to by today's urban youth.

39
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,752
- Really?
- Yes.

40
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:26,760
Now, should that happen, I would ask you
to find some way to suppress your libido.

41
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:32,362
I could think about you.

42
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:36,731
Fine. Whatever works.

43
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:40,640
Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.

44
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,573
Peace out.

45
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,034
SHELDON:
Mm.

46
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,574
Well, this is very pleasant.

47
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,418
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.

48
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:26,419
And you said there would never
be enough pasta for the three of us.

49
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:28,250
I stand corrected.

50
00:03:28,424 --> 00:03:31,052
You know,
Italian housewives have a rule of thumb:

51
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:33,787
A handful of dry pasta
about an inch in diameter...

52
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:38,696
...is sufficient for each person,
as it doubles in volume when cooked.

53
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:40,361
That's very interesting.

54
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:43,994
- Thank you.
- She doesn't mean it. She's just being nice.

55
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:49,637
Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems
to be dropping the conversational ball...

56
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,280
...I guess I'll just have to pick it up.
Ahem.

57
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,386
Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?

58
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:06,555
- No.
- Good.

59
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:09,197
- What's your favorite fruit?
- It, uh--

60
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:10,923
Strawberries.

61
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,159
Mm, technically not a fruit, but all right.

62
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:17,398
Where did you do
your medical internship?

63
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:19,734
Uh, Lawrence Memorial in Galveston, Texas.

64
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:21,900
Really? That's where I was born.

65
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,911
- You're kidding.
SHELDON: No.

66
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:28,846
I spent so much of my childhood
at that hospital. It--

67
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:32,078
When I was 12,
I got to ride there in a helicopter.

68
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:35,953
- What? What happened?
- Radiation burns.

69
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,094
A little mishap
while I was building my own CAT scanner.

70
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:42,493
I'm sorry, you tried to build
your own CAT scanner?

71
00:04:42,665 --> 00:04:44,633
No, I didn't try, I succeeded.

72
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:48,396
I was briefly able to see the inside
of my sister's guinea pig, Snowball...

73
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:50,596
...before he caught fire.

74
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:53,571
It led to an interesting expression
in our house:

75
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:56,507
Not a Snowball's chance
in a CAT scanner.

76
00:04:58,114 --> 00:05:00,344
Uh, Sheldon.

77
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:02,109
Excuse me.

78
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:06,455
When I come back, just for fun,
the subject will be alternative history.

79
00:05:06,622 --> 00:05:09,318
Specifically, how would the Civil War
have gone differently...

80
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:12,052
...if Lincoln had been
a robot sent from the future?

81
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,464
Look at that, there's even pasta left over.

82
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,531
Do you understand
that this was supposed to be a date?

83
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:25,230
I do. Do you?

84
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,536
Because, frankly, you've been
in a foul mood since I sat down.

85
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:33,949
Okay, here's my question:

86
00:05:34,117 --> 00:05:36,312
Why did you sit down?

87
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:40,149
To help.
Look, if you fail at this relationship...

88
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:42,086
...and history suggests you will...

89
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:48,221
...then we risk losing the medical officer
that our landing party has always needed.

90
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,391
What landing party?

91
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:56,437
You're Kirk. I'm Spock.
Wolowitz is Scotty.

92
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,541
Koothrappali is the guy
who always gets killed.

93
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,140
And now we've got McCoy.

94
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:14,786
So we're all standing around
looking at the post-op X-ray...

95
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,188
...and there it is, clear as day,
right in the guy's chest cavity:

96
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:20,522
One of my earrings.

97
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:24,059
Oh, my God, what did you do?

98
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:25,530
Ha, ha. What do you think I did?

99
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:27,566
I discreetly slipped off the other earring...

100
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:29,967
...put it in my pocket,
and then got the hell out of there.

104
00:06:37,847 --> 00:06:42,477
I'm sorry I'm late, but your companion
left the most indecipherable invitation.

105
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,620
What invitation?

106
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,722
"We're going to the movies."

107
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,552
What movie? What theater? What time?

108
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:56,288
If you were trying to make it impossible to
locate you, you couldn't have done better.

Oh, clearly, I could have.

313
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:03,791
Oh, man, did you switch your status
before she did?

314
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:08,426
Speaking as an expert,
way to look needy.

315
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:11,662
Seriously?
You went first after only two weeks?

316
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:13,563
That's bold.

317
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,635
It's not bold, it's a mistake.

318
00:19:15,804 --> 00:19:17,567
I didn't change my status.

319
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,764
Well, then who did?

320
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:27,548
I had no choice. He cried in front of her.

321
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:30,781
You hacked my Facebook account?

322
00:19:30,953 --> 00:19:36,186
Oh, it's hardly hacking when you use
the same password for everything, Kal-EI.

323
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:40,192
Are you insane?
Now she's gonna think I'm desperate.

324
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:42,421
You've destroyed this relationship.

325
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:46,728
And you wanna know the worst part?
You don't understand what you did wrong...

326
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:51,202
...because you can't conceive of something
that you are not an expert in.

327
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:54,137
- In which I am not an expert.
- Don't even--

328
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:59,013
Don't wanna hear another word
out of you.

329
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:00,705
Ooh.

330
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:05,710
What's wrong, Lassie?
Timmy fall down the well?

331
00:20:08,857 --> 00:20:10,256
Oh, wow.

332
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:12,586
She just updated her Facebook status.

333
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:17,089
"Stephanie Barnett is in a relationship
with Leonard Hofstadter."

334
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:19,491
Really?

335
00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:23,494
Oh, look at that.

336
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:25,697
I have a girlfriend. Ha, ha.

337
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:28,102
If I am permitted to speak again...

338
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:31,838
...Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win.

339
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,667
