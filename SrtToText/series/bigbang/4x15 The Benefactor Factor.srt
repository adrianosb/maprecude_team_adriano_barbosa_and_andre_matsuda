any human flesh to eat?

They can't starve to death,
they're already dead.

You take this one.
I spent an hour last night...

6
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:20,371
...on how do vampires shave when
they can't see themselves in the mirror?

7
00:00:21,707 --> 00:00:25,302
Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs
and shave each other. Case closed.

8
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:30,709
- Yeah, okay, so, zombies?
- I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj.

Are we talking slow zombies,
fast zombies?

10

Like in 28 Days, if those zombies
didn't eat, they starved.

11
00:00:36,355 --> 00:00:39,688
That's 28 Days Later. 28 Days is where
Sandra Bullock goes to rehab...

Why's the president of the university
slumming in the cafeteria? Ha, ha.

17
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,741
Perhaps he's emulating
Shakespeare's Henry V...

and mingled...

...on the subject of his administration
he could have saved himself the trouble.

Sorry, Dr. Cooper.
I forgot you have a touch phobia.

It's not a touch phobia,
it's a germ phobia.

...doesn't mean you should jump into
his windowless van.

- What's the occasion?
- Just a fundraiser for the university.

Aha. The tear-stained air mattress

And I sympathize.

for our research.

00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:45,840
You're kidding?
That was good for you?

153
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:48,002
Because I was sweating
through my T-shirt.

154
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,805
Excellent.
There's nothing I like better...

155
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:54,180
...than making smart people
feel ill at ease.

156
00:08:54,353 --> 00:08:56,753
- Why?
- I don't know, it's one of the fun things...

157
00:08:56,922 --> 00:08:59,720
...you get to do
when you have lots of money.

158
00:09:00,492 --> 00:09:04,019
Watch. Hey! Who said
you could eat that shrimp?

159
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:10,030
See? Fun.

160
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:11,862
SHELDON:
No, no, no. I'm just...

161
00:09:12,037 --> 00:09:16,474
...here for your money. I don't wanna
shake anyone's germy hands.

162
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:19,243
Explain it to them, Siebert.

163
00:09:24,316 --> 00:09:27,376
I must confess, I don't understand you,
President Siebert.

164
00:09:27,552 --> 00:09:30,248
First you say you want me to appear
at your fundraisers.

165
00:09:30,422 --> 00:09:33,914
But now you say you never want me
to go anywhere near your fundraisers.

166
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:36,560
Forgive me, but that sounds
like a mixed message.

167
00:09:37,663 --> 00:09:42,726
Here we go again. If there's simply
no talking to me, then why did you call?

168
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:45,934
I'm sorry, someone's on the other line.

169
00:09:46,104 --> 00:09:50,336
Uh, why don't you see if you can organize
your thoughts and we'll try again later.

170
00:09:51,376 --> 00:09:54,072
Cooper-Hofstadter residence.
Go for Cooper.

171
00:09:54,246 --> 00:09:55,713
Good morning, Mrs. Latham.

172
00:09:56,248 --> 00:09:57,875
Yes, of course I remember you.

173
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,349
A woman well past her prime
seeking to augment her social status...

174
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,387
...by doling out her late husband's
ill-gotten gains.

175
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,586
So how much money
are you going to give me?

176
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:12,596
I'm not crazy,
my mother had me tested.

177
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:16,895
If you're not going to give me money,
then why are you calling?

178
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:20,095
She wants to talk to you.

179
00:10:20,605 --> 00:10:22,596
Who's crazy now?

180
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:25,769
Hello, Mrs. Latham.

181
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:28,139
Yes, I live with him.

182
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:30,781
I don't... I really don't know why.

183
00:10:36,955 --> 00:10:39,617
Tonight? Sure. That'd be great.

184
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:43,954
Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.

185
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:47,489
Uh, she wants to have dinner
and talk about my research.

186
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,260
An entire dinner
to talk about your research?

187
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,634
Where are you going,
the drive-through at Jack in the Box?

188
00:10:58,243 --> 00:11:02,179
Well, wherever we're going,
she's sending a car to pick me up.

189
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:05,741
- Okay, I see what's happening.
- What?

190
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:07,817
My stature intimidates her...

191
00:11:07,986 --> 00:11:11,149
...so she's using you to get to me.

192
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:15,418
Crafty old gal.

193
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:16,618
Excuse me...

194
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:19,593
...but you are not the only
scientist in this apartment.

195
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:21,528
I've been published in journals...

196
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,194
...I received a dissertation-of-the-year
award for experimental particle physics.

197
00:11:26,405 --> 00:11:27,963
No, that can't be it.

198
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:30,468
Since you seem to have forgotten...

199
00:11:30,642 --> 00:11:33,167
...the reason we live together
is we're best friends.

200
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:35,404
And I got your back, Jack.

201
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,315
That was a great meal.

202
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:41,850
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

203
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,885
I eat this well
when my mom's in town...

204
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:46,718
...and she takes me out to dinner.
- Is that so?

205
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:48,517
You kind of remind me of her.

206
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:52,187
She enjoys
making people uncomfortable too.

207
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:55,365
Well, you remind me of a boy
I dated in college.

208
00:11:55,534 --> 00:11:58,094
- No kidding.
- Sweet boy, very smart.

209
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,034
- Huh.
- Lf only he'd had money.

210
00:12:03,842 --> 00:12:06,072
Yeah, um, so hey...

211
00:12:06,244 --> 00:12:10,180
...speaking of money, how are you feeling
about helping the Physics Department...

212
00:12:10,348 --> 00:12:13,181
...get a cryogenic centrifugal pump
and molecular sieve?

213
00:12:13,385 --> 00:12:16,684
Well, I must say you make
a very persuasive case for it.

214
00:12:17,022 --> 00:12:18,353
Oh, good, good.

215
00:12:18,523 --> 00:12:21,583
And I'm seriously considering
taking it to the next level.

216
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,058

Okay, now you don't remind me
of my mom.

219

I'm sorry, so eventually zombies...

where Sandra Bullock is?

Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.

222

all that work she's doing to get sober...

223

...only to be torn apart and eaten alive.

224
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,232
- Hey, how was dinner?
- Swell. I need a drink.

225
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:08,031
Do we have any alcohol?

226
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:09,798
No. But we have potatoes.

227
00:13:10,008 --> 00:13:12,135
I could make you vodka.

228
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,538
It'll take two weeks.

229
00:13:15,013 --> 00:13:16,446
Leonard, are you okay?

230
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:18,378
Uh, I'm not sure.

231
00:13:18,783 --> 00:13:20,444
- What's going on?
- Well...

232
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:23,884
...Mrs. Latham said she was seriously
considering donating money...

233
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:26,319
...so we could get
a cryogenic centrifugal pump.

234

- Oh, wow.
- Yes!

235
00:13:27,826 --> 00:13:30,294
Then she stuck her tongue
down my throat.

236
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:32,562
Why?

wanted to have sex with you...

240
00:13:44,276 --> 00:13:47,768
...in exchange for giving
your department millions of dollars?

00:13:47,946 --> 00:13:51,040
- I think so.
- You lucky duck.

00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,482
You're really a broken toy, aren't you?

243
00:13:55,854 --> 00:13:59,847
I was able to get out of there, but she
wants to see me again tomorrow night.

00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:02,583
Excellent.

- What?
- Penny.

sexual favors for gain.

a cryogenic centrifugal pump.

sexual favors for material gain?

00:14:36,962 --> 00:14:39,021
It was a compliment.

where credit is due.

from the School of Pharmacology.

your reluctance.

00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:25,319
- I hadn't really given it much thought.
- Well, think about it.

307
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,568
- You mean?
- Yep, I'm that good.

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,386
Good morning, slut.

311
00:17:58,229 --> 00:17:59,924
What?

312
00:18:00,098 --> 00:18:03,727
Oh, please. I recognize
the walk of shame when I see it.

313
00:18:03,902 --> 00:18:05,836
All you're missing
is smeared mascara...

314
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:09,235
...and a purse with panties
wadded up in it.

315
00:18:09,407 --> 00:18:12,035
- What's going on?
- Oh, nothing's going on. Excuse me.

- Are you just getting home?
- Yeah.

That's a good sign, right?

00:18:17,415 --> 00:18:20,714
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm so proud of you!

319
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:24,048
You sold yourself out
like a common streetwalker.

320
00:18:26,024 --> 00:18:27,958
No, I didn't do it for the money.

321
00:18:28,126 --> 00:18:30,424
She stiffed you?

322
00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:32,859
I believe that's what
your roommate did to her.

323
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:37,459
- What?
- Again, read the book we gave you.

324
00:18:38,903 --> 00:18:41,201
No, I got the money first.

325
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:42,737
Smart. Get paid up front.

326
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:45,933
Yeah, I think you have a real knack
for gigolo work, Leonard.

- I'm gonna go lie down.
- That's a good idea, get your rest.

329

There are more rich old ladies out there
and daddy needs a new linear accelerator.

330
00:18:59,657 --> 00:19:03,923
And I thought he didn't learn anything
from his relationship with you.

331
00:19:04,229 --> 00:19:05,958
- Hey!
- Another compliment.

332
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,392
Learn to recognize them.

Oh, there he is! The man of the hour!

334

Keep telling yourself that.
It makes it easier.
