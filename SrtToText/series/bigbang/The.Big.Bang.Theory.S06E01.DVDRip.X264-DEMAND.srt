1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,864
Previously on The Big Bang Theory:

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:07,666
We now pronounce you
husband and wife.

3
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:13,601
- I love this part!
- Me too!

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,977
I have strongly mixed feelings.

5
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:22,248
So Howard's really in space?

6
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:25,914
The International Space Station,
250 miles that way. Heh.

7
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:28,890
Right now Howard
is staring down at our planet...

8
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,553
...like a tiny Jewish Greek god.

9
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,264
Zeus-owitz.

10
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:39,102
I must admit,
I can't help but feel a twinge of envy.

11
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,103
He can look out the window...

12
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:45,040
...and see the majesty of the universe
unfolding before his eyes.

13
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,442
His dim, uncomprehending eyes.

14
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:54,651
It's like a cat in an airport carrying case.

15
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,618
You know,
it's not exactly glamorous up there.

16
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:02,228
The water the astronauts drink
is made from each other's recycled urine.

17
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,458
Must be nice.

18
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,862
Nobody wants anything
that comes out of me.

19
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:18,636
- I wonder what he's doing this very second.
- Conducting experiments in zero gravity.

20
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,440
Peering through his telescope
at the birth of the cosmos.

21
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:24,481
Whatever it is,
we know his life will never be the same.

22
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:28,512
Howard, can you hear me?

23
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:31,686
I can hear you without the phone!

24
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:36,618
Don't be snippy.
I'm just excited to talk to my baby.

25
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:39,128
I'm excited to talk to you too.

26
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,464
So, what's this mishegas about you
moving out to go live with the little Polish girl?

27
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,935
How about calling her my wife? Heh.

28
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,506
Wives don't take boys from their mothers.

29
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:53,271
They do, that's why we marry them.

30
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:59,282
I just hope I'm not dead
from a broken heart before you get back.

31
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,953
Ma, please, everyone from NASA
is listening to this phone call.

32
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,719
Good, they should know
what a horrible son you are.

33
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:11,124
Okay, Ma, great talking to you.
Gotta go.

34
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,159
Well...

35
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,857
...space is ruined.

36
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,601
This is so exciting.

37
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:56,739
Soon my upper lip will be the same
fake-blond as my beautiful best friend.

38
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,008
Hey, this is my natural hair color.

39
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,106
Now.

40
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,479
So does Sheldon have anything special
planned for you tomorrow night?

41
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:13,092
Yes. According to the relationship agreement,
on the anniversary of our first date...

42
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,126
...he must take me to a nice dinner,
ask about my day...

43
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,287
...and engage in casual physical contact...

44
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,558
...that a disinterested onlooker
might mistake for intimacy.

45
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,326
That's hot.

46
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,099
You kids better use protection.

47
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,841
- How long does this stay on?
- Just a couple minutes.

48
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,707
- You've really never done this before?
- Once in high school. But I dozed off...

49
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,748
...and woke up with second degree
chemical burns on my face.

50
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,410
Oh, my gosh, that's awful.
Did the other kids make fun of you?

51
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,489
No, I had a cover story.
I told everyone it was herpes.

52
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:50,490
- So how's everything with you and Leonard?
- I don't know. It's still kind of weird.

53
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:54,099
We haven't really recovered
since he proposed to me in the middle of sex.

54
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,531
Oh. Boo-hoo.

55
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,934
If Sheldon proposed to me during sex...

56
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,801
...my ovaries would grab onto him
and never let go.

57
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,382
Leonard, where do you stand
on the anthropic principle?

58
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:15,844
- Interesting question. On the one hand...
- You don't even know what it is, do you?

59
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,950
The anthropic principle states...

60
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:23,061
...that if we wish to explain
why our universe exists the way it does...

61
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,959
...the answer is that
it must have qualities...

62
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,464
...that allow intelligent creatures
to arise...

63
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,626
...who are capable of asking the question.

64
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:34,136
As I am doing so eloquently right now.

65
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,099
I know what the anthropic principle is.

66
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,475
Of course.
I just explained it to you.

67
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,042
Now, where do you stand on it?

68
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,184
- Where do you stand on it?
- Strongly pro.

69
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,013
Then I believe that God
created the world in six days...

70
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,485
...and on the seventh
he made you to annoy me.

71
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,188
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

72
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:59,593
Raj, where do you stand
on the anthropic principle?

73
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,666
- I'm all for it.
- Thattaboy.

74
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,735
Why do you believe that he knows
what it is, and I don't?

75
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,337
Oh, Leonard...

76
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:10,067
...let's not take a saw to the branch
we're sitting on, shall we?

77
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,777
Hey, if you guys are free tonight
I heard about a spa...

78
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,414
...where you soak your feet
in a pool of fish...

79
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,277
...that eat the dead skin off them.

80
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,911
I don't need to tell you, in Los Angeles...

81
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,079
...sandal season is year round.

82
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,256
- Actually, I'm hanging out with Penny.
- Oh, okay.

83
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,020
Sounds like it's me and you.

84
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,562
How about we sic some guppies
on those puppies?

85
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,524
As I've stated before
on numerous occasions...

86
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,467
...the only sea creature
I would consider being eaten by...

87
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,699
...is the Kraken. Because the last words
I would hear are "release the Kraken."

88
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,740
That never gets old.

89
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,505
Release the Kraken!

90
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,205
Oh, chills.

91
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:53,045
Besides, I'm having dinner with Amy.

92
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,978
Oh, okay. I'll just go home and be alone.

93
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,558
Which is cool.
I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so...

94
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,418
...cool.

95
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:05,889
Darn.

96
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,898
If you weren't busy I'd ask you to join us.

97
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,299
Really? I can come? Thanks.

98
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,565
Sheldon, are you sure you wanna bring Raj
on your date night?

99
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,437
Oh, absolutely.

100
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,078
I have a contractual obligation...

101
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:23,841
...to provide Amy with conversation
and casual physical contact.

102
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:28,453
But nowhere is it specified
that I can't outsource that to an Indian.

103
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,317
Howie?

104
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:39,662
- Howie?
- Hey, there's my beautiful bride.

105
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,027
- Can you see me?
- I can.

106
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,760
- How are you?
- I'm amazing.

107
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,269
This is even better than I dreamed.

108
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,465
I look out the window...

109
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,110
...and it's all so unbelievable.

110
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:57,443
Good for you. I just had a seemingly
endless dinner with your mom.

111
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,779
Oh, yeah? That's nice. Heh.

112
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:04,980
It was. Until I found out you never told her
we're not gonna live with her.

113
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,252
Let's talk about that for a minute.

114
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:13,022
Hey, look, this pen is floating. Heh.

115
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,834
How crazy is that?

116
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,303
You said you told her but you never did.

117
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,739
Okay, okay, I know you're upset...

118
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:29,075
...but let me share something
I've learned since I got here.

119
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,577
You realize how small
your problems are...

120
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,812
...when you're looking down
on them from space.

121
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,787
Heh. Come on,
that's gotta make you feel better.

122
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,850
How clear is the image of me
on that screen?

123
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,488
Pretty clear. Heh.

124
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,224
Do I look like I feel better?

125
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,497
I mean, it's not, like, HD quality.

126
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:55,504
Listen, you're gonna talk to your mother
and you're gonna fix this.

127
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,610
Or that thing I said I was gonna do to you
when you got home...

128
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,177
...you can do to yourself.

129
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,542
Like he's been doing since he got here.

130
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,918
Sheldon, this place is so romantic.

131
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:18,029
Aw... I'm glad you like it. Raj picked it out.

132
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,959
When you see him,
tell him I say thank you.

133
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,624
Tell him yourself.

134
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,028
Yoo-hoo! Over here.

135
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,574
I don't understand. What's he doing here?

136
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,872
- I invited him.
- On our date?

137
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,639
Sheldon, that's not okay.

138
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:41,219
Oh. Yes, it is. There's a loophole
in the relationship agreement.

139
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,921
You found a loophole?

140
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,923
Sorry I started without you...

141
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,586
...I'm a little nervous.
It's been a long time since I've been on a date.

142
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:55,467
I can't believe
I bleached my mustache for this.

143
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:59,230
You should go to my girl,
she'll knock out those sideburns for free.

144
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:10,448
You know, Amy, I don't think
you and I have had a real conversation.

145
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,312
Let's use tonight
to get to know each other better.

146
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,618
You start.

147
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,020
Go home.

148
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,527
- I don't understand.
- Sheldon, how could you do this?

149
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,790
- It's our second anniversary.
- It's your anniversary?

150
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,933
Oh, my God, I had no idea.

151
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,328
Amy, please, let me make this right.

152
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,873
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Waiter?

153
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,805
A bottle of champagne
and three glasses.

154
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,679
Oh, boy, isn't this romantic?

155
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:46,141
I hope that's a rhetorical question
because I have no clue.

156
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,648
Mm. This is great, what's the occasion?

157
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:54,054
No occasion.
Things have been a little weird between us...

158
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,786
...so I wanted to throw together
a fun night for you.

159
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,897
- That is so sweet.
- I got your favorites:

160
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:03,297
Beer, wings, sliders, we can watch
the football game. I even painted my stomach.

161
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,402
- Go sports?
- Well?

162
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:12,010
In case you were in the mood for baseball,
I didn't wanna look ridiculous.

163
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,509
- This is awesome, I love it.
- Good, I'm glad.

164
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,047
I worked my ass off,
so this is what I needed.

165
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,242
Great, just relax and enjoy.
Tonight is all about you.

166
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,853
Ah. Thank you.

167
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,153
So where exactly are we
in this relationship?

168
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:33,529
Oh, come on, I just told you
I had a hard day.

169
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,691
- You're right, I'm sorry. Let's watch the game.
- Great.

170
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:42,769
Just know, the longer we wait
to talk about it the weirder it gets.

171
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,670
Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?

172
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,206
Absolutely. You're the girl, I'm the guy.

173
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,374
Watch your football game
while I make you a plate here.

174
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,018
Thank you.

175
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,355
I'll get it. Go sports! Heh.

176
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,354
Hello-Io-Io.

177
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,457
I thought you were out
with Sheldon and Amy.

178
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:10,033
I was, but it's their anniversary,
and I didn't wanna be a third wheel...

179
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,103
...so I figured I'd hang out
with you and Penny on your date.

180
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:17,534
It's not really a great time.
Penny and I have some things to talk about.

181
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,143
No we don't, come on in!

182
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,877
Sweet.

183
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:25,149
I can't believe
I shaved my stomach for this.

184
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,791
Hey, Froot Loops.

185
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,124
You got a phone call.

186
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,828
Who is it?

187
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,934
A woman who says she's your mother
but sounds like your father.

188
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,602
Hey, Ma.

189
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:53,575
You know, we could see each other
if you turn on the computer.

190
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,839
I'm not going near that fakakta thing.

191
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,539
I'll catch a computer virus!

192
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,945
You can't catch a computer virus.

193
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:07,252
Oh, so now you're an astronaut
and a doctor?

194
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,054
What do you want, Ma?

195
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:15,063
Your wife says you have
something important to tell me.

196
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,635
Okay, here it is:

197
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:23,166
Bernadette and I
are starting a life together.

198
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:24,434
- And...
- Oh, God.

199
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,271
You are gonna leave me!

200
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,470
- Ma...
- It's okay.

201
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,942
Your father left me, you left me.

202
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:35,019
I guess I'm just the kind of person
people like to leave.

203
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:41,225
It's not definite. I'll talk to Bernadette.

204
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,451
Don't bother.

205
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:47,122
I'll just go sit in a hole in the ground
so I'm no trouble when I die.

206
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,293
Stop it, Ma.

207
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:53,700
I'm sure I can get Bernie to come around.

208
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:57,331
I knew it! I knew she was behind this.

209
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:02,971
You listen to me, if you wanna be a man
you can't let a woman tell you what to do.

210
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,513
Okay, okay.

211
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:10,553
I can't believe these people
won the Cold War.

212
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:15,491
Now, can we please change the subject?

213
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:20,530
Fine. Explain why you've been gone so long
and I haven't gotten a single letter.

214
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,497
Not even a lousy postcard!

215
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,706
You know,
I'm growing to like American football.

216
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,777
- Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?
- Well...

217
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:38,713
...it's not the balls-to-the-wall action
of badminton or cricket, but hey...

218
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,775
...what is?

219
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,744
Who's ready for another beer?

220
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,151
- I'm good.
- No, thank you.

221
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,056
Girls.

222
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,890
I am having the nicest time.

223
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,691
You guys are like family to me.
You know that, right?

224
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,595
That's great. Get out.

225
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:59,927
- What? Why?
- Penny and I have some issues to talk about.

226
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:03,040
Oh, pish on your issues.

227
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,571
You guys are fine.

228
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,312
Yes, you've had some bumps
along the way.

229
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,813
I mean, Penny, you've always known
how this man has felt about you.

230
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,282
But you made him grovel for affection.

231
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,717
- Okay, hold on...
- Don't blame yourself.

232
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,789
He was a groveler from way back.

233
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:24,223
But the point is,
the two of you got past it.

234
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,264
And you go and propose to this poor girl
in the middle of sex?

235
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,425
That was some weak tea, dude.

236
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,905
Some people might say it was romantic.

237
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,602
Yeah, no.

238
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,944
But yet, here you two are still together.

239
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,081
Even after you and I
had our crazy naked night.

240
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,648
- That's enough.
- Okay.

241
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:45,943
I'm just saying...

242
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,086
...that after all you've been through...

243
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:52,418
...you get to look into each other's eyes
and say I love you.

244
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,291
And that's beautiful.

245
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,321
Actually, to this day
she's never really said it.

246
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,795
Oh, Penny, that's ridiculous!

247
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,597
You know you love him.
Look him in the eyes and say it.

248
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,435
- Raj.
- You know you want to say it. Say it.

249
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,334
Say you love him.

250
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,781
Say it!

251
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,884
I really thought she would say it.

252
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:35,128
Have I ever told you
you're like a sexy praying mantis?

253
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,037
Every time you drink alcohol.

254
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,569
You know, what's wonderful
about the praying mantis...

255
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,543
...they devour their mate.

256
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,505
Your point being?

257
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,079
Dessert is served.

258
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,657
I just had cobbler.

259
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,486
You know what?

260
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,487
I'm done with this.

261
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,592
- But where are you going?
- I'm leaving.

262
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,498
You can't leave, I need you.

263
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,436
- You do?
- Yes.

264
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,507
You're my ride.

265
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,146
Sheldon...

266
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,150
...you either say something meaningful
and from the heart...

267
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,719
...or you and I are done.

268
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,821
All right.

269
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,488
Please.

270
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,857
Amy...

271
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,093
...when I look in your eyes...

272
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,568
...and you're looking back in mine...

273
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,503
...everything feels...

274
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,540
...not quite normal...

275
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,575
...because I feel...

276
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,346
...stronger and weaker at the same time.

277
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,007
I feel excited...

278
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,245
...and at the same time, terrified.

279
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:05,685
The truth is...

280
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,052
...I don't know what I feel...

281
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,356
...except I know what kind of man
I want to be.

282
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,061
Sheldon.

283
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,864
That was beautiful.

284
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,871
I should hope so,
that's from the first Spider-Man movie.

285
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,069
I'll take it.

286
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:33,474
Good.
Now, I assume we're splitting the check?

287
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,252
- Hey, Stuart.
- Oh, hey.

288
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,220
I was actually just about to close.

289
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,658
- Oh, I'm sorry, I'll leave.
- No, no, it's okay.

290
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,296
- Hang out.
- You sure?

291
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,729
Yeah, you're my first customer today.

292
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,899
All right, great.

293
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,800
I'm, uh, having a nightcap,
you wannajoin me?

294
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,572
- What are you drinking?
- Coffee liqueur in a Chewbacca mug.

295
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,503
I call it a sad-tini.

296
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,472
Perfect for the night I'm having,
thank you.

297
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:08,652
- Mm. Nice not to drink alone.
- Amen to that.

298
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,817
Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay
into my dog's water bowl.

299
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,519
- You're kidding?
- He's kind of a mean drunk...

300
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,923
...but what you gonna do?

301
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,856
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

302
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,591
- A little music?
- Sure.

303
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:29,865
Mm. Bossa nova.

304
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,409
You listen to that with your hips
as well as your ears.

305
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,111
Ahh.

306
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,982
Something about Latin music...

307
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:45,715
...makes me feel
like I'm on a white sand beach in Rio.

308
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,518
Yeah?

309
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,896
Sun, the waves, the beautiful bodies...

310
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,124
...tanned and glistening with sweat.

311
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,309
- I should go.
- Yeah.

312
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:17,652
- Uh, thank you for the drink.
- No problem.

313
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,882
- Hey, Stuart.
- Yeah?

314
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,227
You wanna hang out tomorrow night?

315
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,829
Maybe grab a bite to eat
or catch a late movie?

316
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,560
Yeah, I'd like to
but I'm a little tight on funds.

317
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,667
No problem, my treat.
I'll swing by after work.

318
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,504
- Okay.
- Okay.

319
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,538
I could do worse.

320
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:52,345
That's such good news, Howie.
Thank you for telling her.

321
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,425
Hey, I'm a grown man.
I'm gonna live with my wife.

322
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:59,792
My mother's just gonna have to learn
to make do on her own.

323
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,622
Was she upset?

324
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,769
Who can tell? She yells everything.

325
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,629
She might have been upset.

326
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,533
She might have been hungry.

327
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,309
Thanks for fixing it. I love you.

328
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,540
I love you too. Sweet dreams.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

329
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,442
Goodnight, Rocket Man.

330
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:25,382
To infinity and beyond, baby.

331
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:32,730
Loops, you realize you just lied your ass off
to your wife and your mother.

332
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:36,230
- I know.
- What are you gonna do when you get back?

333
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,169
Oh, I'm never going back. Heh.
