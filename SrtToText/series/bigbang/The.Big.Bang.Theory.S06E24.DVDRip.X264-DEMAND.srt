1
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:08,466
So anyway, last night on video chat, I spent,
like, 20 minutes just staring into Lucy's eyes.

2
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:12,133
- That sounds romantic.
- It was, until I realized the screen had frozen.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,212
Still one of my top three dates of all time.

4
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,551
So we ever gonna hang out with this girl?

5
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:21,983
Ahh, I'd love that, but she's not
really comfortable around people.

6
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:26,819
Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable
around people, but then I learned a trick.

7
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:31,225
I pretend everyone I meet
is a beloved character from Star Trek.

8
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:33,896
How's that working for you?

9
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:37,400
Oh, like a charm,
unnamed crewman in a red shirt.

10
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:41,605
Leonard, I may have gotten you ajob.

11
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:46,440
- I have ajob.
- Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim.

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,244
No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking's
team is sending an expedition...

13
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:54,581
...to the North Sea to test
hydrodynamic simulations of black holes.

14
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:58,815
One of their experimental physicists
dropped out and I recommended you.

15
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,526
Well, do you really think I have a shot?

16
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:05,255
Yeah, I've worked with Hawking,
I talked you up. He knows your research.

17
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,457
- I think this could happen.
- He kno...?

18
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:08,658
Wow.

19
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:12,100
Wait, now, but do you think
that's a good idea?

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,600
You know Star Trek.

21
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:19,040
Should a guy with no name
and a red shirt really go on an expedition?

22
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,548
Hey, don't discourage him.
This is a fantastic opportunity.

23
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,775
No one asked you, Uhura.

24
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:33,490
Would you like to hear a classic
Sheldon Cooper factoid?

25
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,389
- What do you think?
- Great.

26
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,297
I've been doing some reading
about vehicular safety.

27
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:44,460
Did you know that the highest number
of drowning accidents...

28
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:48,164
...happen on or around boats?

29
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:52,509
Interesting that you would bring that up
when I might go work on a boat.

30
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,648
Well, that's the thing about factoids,
they're interesting.

31
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,675
I know what you're doing.

32
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,521
You don't want me going on this trip
because you're afraid to be alone.

33
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,958
I'm not afraid to be alone.

34
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,184
On land.

35
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,162
On the sea, it would be terrifying.

36
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,661
Because of all the drowning.

37
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,669
- Sheldon.
- Fine, no more drowning talk.

38
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,670
I'll change the subject.

39
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:25,309
Who do you think would win in a fight...

40
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,470
...you or a shark?

41
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:34,776
Look, I appreciate your signature blend of
concern for me and incredible selfishness...

42
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:40,652
...but if I get the chance to do this, there's
nothing you can say that's going to stop me.

43
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,226
Very well.

44
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,464
Things between you and Penny
have never been better.

45
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,227
I hope four months apart
doesn't change anything.

46
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,800
I should've opened with that, huh?

47
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,937
If you look carefully at Venus...

48
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:30,235
...you should be able to see
the International Space Station pass by.

49
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,402
Wow, your friend was actually up there?

50
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,048
Yeah, he brought me back
a T-shirt that said:

51
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:40,414
"My Friend Went to the Space Station
and All I Got Was This Lousy T-shirt."

52
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,114
Did he take the T-shirt to space?

53
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,780
Nope. It's exactly as lousy as advertised.

54
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:51,030
Speaking of friends,
they have been asking to meet you.

55
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,957
I was thinking maybe
we could all hang out sometime?

56
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,931
I don't know, how many are there?

57
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,463
Let's see. Six.

58
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,937
That's pretty cool. I have six friends.

59
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,034
I'm kind of like Sinatra.

60
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,780
Six strangers, that's a lot of pressure.

61
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,216
Staring at me, asking me
personal questions like, "What do you do?

62
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:19,955
Where are you from? Why did you
lock yourself in the bathroom?"

63
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:24,558
Okay, how about you just
dip your toe in and meet one of them?

64
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,500
- Will you be there?
- Of course.

65
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,967
Well, that's two. Three if you count me.
This is getting out of hand.

66
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:39,403
So then, during my afternoon shift,
I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.

67
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,412
- Oh, that's awful.
- Not really. My shirt was soaking wet.

68
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,812
I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.

69
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,650
So listen, do you remember
when I said the similarities...

70
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,656
...of the equations of general relativity
and hydrodynamics...

71
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:58,195
...suggest you could find the equivalent
of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?

72
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,989
I thought I said that to you.

73
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:10,941
Anyway, Stephen Hawking's team is looking
into that, and I've been invited to join them.

74
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,601
Wow, Hawking. Good for you.

75
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,840
Well, it is,
just, you know, I'd be gone for a while.

76
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,177
- Well, how long?
- Three, four months.

77
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,179
Whoa.

78
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,720
- When would you leave?
- Couple of weeks.

79
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,848
Wow.

80
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,188
- Okay, well, I'll just come visit you.
- That's the thing, you can't.

81
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,353
I'll be on a ship in the North Sea.

82
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:35,331
On a ship? Aren't they afraid
Hawking will just roll overboard?

83
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,797
He's not gonna be there. He's just
sending a team to research his theory.

84
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:46,172
Oh, sure. Like when you send me
to kill spiders in your bathtub.

85
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,046
Oh. Okay. So four months.

86
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,480
Yeah.

87
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:57,555
And I'm a little worried because
things between us have been so great...

88
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,557
...and I'd hate to do anything
that screws that up.

89
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,388
If you're gonna screw things up...

90
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,395
...it's gonna be while you're here,
not while you're away.

91
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,928
I mean, look, you have to go.
It sounds like an amazing opportunity.

92
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,837
And I'm just basing that on how much
I didn't understand what you said about it.

93
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:23,242
Okay. I'll confirm the travel arrangements
in the morning.

94
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:24,943
Okay, good.

95
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,282
- I do have to ask you one favor.
- Sure.

96
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:31,753
Sheldon's nervous about me leaving,
keep an eye on him while I'm gone.

97
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:36,258
Oh, I don't know. Remember what happened
when I took care of your goldfish?

98
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,532
Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet
and get me a new one.

99
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,367
Really, you guys do not need
to throw me a going away party.

100
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,440
Are you kidding me?
How often can you say bon voyage...

101
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,874
...to somebody when they're
actually going on a voyage?

102
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,912
Hello, Rajesh.

103
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,116
Hello, Amy. Nice to see you.

104
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,820
What can I say, it's funnier with the accent.

105
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:12,462
There's beer in the fridge. Anyway, you guys
really don't need to make a big deal.

106
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,065
Leonard, you're being selfish.

107
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,293
We need to give you a proper send-off
so we'll have closure...

108
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,961
...when you die at sea
and crabs eat your face.

109
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,400
Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.

110
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:28,308
One of the things that helped me get through
Howard being in space for so long...

111
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,449
...was getting married before he left.

112
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,852
Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.

113
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,690
Okay, I have a request to make.

114
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,453
And now he can talk.

115
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:46,491
I want to cut open your brain
and see what the heck's going on in there.

116
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:51,100
The only person allowed
inside this head is Dr. Phil.

117
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:55,339
Anyway, I spoke to my new lady friend
about meeting you all.

118
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,341
She thought it would be easier
for her to start with just one.

119
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:02,345
Gee, I don't know,
my schedule is a little busy.

120
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,679
Actually, I was thinking Leonard.

121
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,551
Well, thank you, Raj, I'd be honored.

122
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:11,189
What the hell?
I thought I was your best friend.

123
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:14,053
You are, but you've got
kind of a big personality...

124
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,390
...with your flashy clothes
and your Woody Allen swagger.

125
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,858
Maybe she'd be more comfortable
meeting a girl first.

126
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,800
- Good idea. Bernadette?
- What the hell?

127
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,041
Well, you're very pretty, that could
be intimidating to another woman.

128
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,700
Oh, yeah.

129
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:36,974
Hey, you don't think I'm pretty enough
to scare your girlfriend?

130
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,084
Calm down, Bernie, you're very scary.

131
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:42,981
It should be me.

132
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,549
Why? So you can make jokes
about cutting open my brain?

133
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:51,085
A, that was not ajoke,
that was a sincere request.

134
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,995
And B, more importantly,
I was the outsider to this group...

135
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,193
...and I know how frightening that can be.

136
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:03,172
But you guys took me in
and made me feel loved, like I was family.

137
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:07,944
Fine, I'll do it.

138
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:15,611
So after I started dating Sheldon,
I met Leonard and then everybody else...

139
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,016
...and they've all been so wonderful to me.

140
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,418
That's really nice to hear.

141
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,958
Maybe next week we could all get together.

142
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,187
Lucy, you don't have to answer that.

143
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,957
Don't put her on the spot,
she hates that. Am I right?

144
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,534
Tell her how much you hate being
put on the spot. Go ahead, tell her.

145
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:31,795
He's a little nervous...

146
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:35,532
...because he doesn't think I understand
the severity of your social anxiety.

147
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,405
You can't talk about social anxiety
to someone who has social anxiety...

148
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,047
...it makes them socially anxious.

149
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:46,277
Excuse me, but I'm a neurobiologist,
I think I'm more qualified than you...

150
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:49,421
...to understand what's not working
in your girlfriend's brain.

151
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,755
Don't call her my girlfriend.

152
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,950
We haven't discussed whether
we're girlfriend and boyfriend yet.

153
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,786
Now that it's out there...

154
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:04,300
...are you my girlfriend? By the way,
if you say no, I'll never be happy again.

155
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,299
Not to put you on the spot.

156
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,369
I think I have to go to the bathroom.

157
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:19,506
We might as well go ahead and eat.
She's not coming back any time soon.

158
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,856
This is ridiculous.
We're shopping for a party.

159
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,790
This store doesn't have a party section.

160
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,260
Yeah, it does, and here we are.

161
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,994
I have to say, Penny,
I don't understand why you, of all people...

162
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,070
...are encouraging Leonard to do this.

163
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,003
Well, I'm his girlfriend,
of course I'm gonna support him.

164
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,166
Well, you're his girlfriend for now.

165
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:49,838
Maybe you're not aware of this,
but there is a rich tradition of men at sea...

166
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:53,417
...finding comfort in each other's arms
and britches.

167
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,985
Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay?

168
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:02,890
He gets to work with Stephen Hawking, who,
by the way, will not be on the boat, I checked.

169
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,656
It's not that big of an opportunity. I mean,
even if Hawking's theories are correct...

170
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,199
...all they prove is
where the universe came from...

171
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,998
...why everything exists
and what its ultimate end will be.

172
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:17,207
Me? I'm interested in the big questions.

173
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,779
Oh, my God,
Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.

174
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,779
I'm not jealous.

175
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,978
I'm just very unhappy that good things are
happening for him and not happening for me.

176
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,681
Sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel.

177
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,326
Just because good things
are happening to Leonard...

178
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,395
...doesn't take anything away from you.
Let me tell you a story.

179
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,498
There was a girl who worked
at the Cheesecake Factory...

180
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,463
...and she wasn't good at herjob.
- It was you.

181
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,227
It wasn't me.

182
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,069
But she was also an actress.

183
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:50,572
We were both up for the same part
in a toothpaste commercial. She got it.

184
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:54,406
I was so jealous, but instead of
ripping out her fake blond hair...

185
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,946
You ripped out your own fake blond hair.

186
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,243
I looked her in the eye, smiled and said,
"I'm happy for you."

187
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,582
Because that's what friends do.

188
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,416
They lie so they don't look petty.

189
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,925
- Yeah.
- How?

190
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,757
Like this.

191
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,524
I am so happy for you.

192
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,035
Wow.

193
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:22,106
No wonder you didn't get
that toothpaste commercial.

194
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,337
- Hey.
- Hey.

195
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:32,875
I want to apologize for Amy last night.
She was completely out of line.

196
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:42,482
Are you not speaking to me
or did the screen freeze again?

197
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,792
Amy wasn't the problem.

198
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,126
Okay, I know, it was me.

199
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,393
I pushed too hard. I'm sorry.

200
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:51,866
Thank you.

201
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:56,771
You know, I've been thinking that maybe
meeting somebody one-on-one...

202
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,136
...is too intense...

203
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,245
...so Friday night,
my friends are having a party.

204
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,711
- A party?
- A little one.

205
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:08,217
It's a farewell for Leonard,
so all the attention will be on him.

206
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:12,323
If you wear something brown and sit on the
couch, they won't even know you're there.

207
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,552
- I'm not sure.
- Please.

208
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,822
- Raj.
- Come on, don't make me beg.

209
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,397
And I'm from India, so I know how to do it.

210
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,595
Okay.

211
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,331
Yeah, thank you. This means a lot to me.

212
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,668
My friends are like my family.

213
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,744
Unless you don't like them,
in which case, they're dead to me.

214
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:40,244
- You ever spent a long time in a boat before?
- Yeah.

215
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:44,253
Are you referring to the time we got stuck
on the Small World ride at Disneyland?

216
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,458
Yeah.

217
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,356
I'm proud of you, Leonard.

218
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:55,933
Working out on the North Sea for months?
That's really something.

219
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,125
I know.

220
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,204
As far as science goes,
this is the adventure of a lifetime.

221
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,603
Ha, ha. Maybe your lifetime, I went to space.

222
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,372
It's not a competition.

223
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,877
You're right, you're right.

224
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:12,949
I'm really proud of you,
and I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.

225
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,580
And space beats water.

226
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,484
Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming.

227
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,559
She is. She's just running a little late.

228
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:27,495
You know how it is, girls, always fussing
about their hair, their makeup, she'll be here.

229
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,099
Just give it a rest, okay?

230
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,304
Can I have your attention, everyone?

231
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,810
That's B-flat for those
who don't have perfect pitch.

232
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:46,847
I would like to propose a toast
to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

233
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,481
He has been presented
with a wonderful opportunity...

234
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:54,114
...and I couldn't be happier for him.

235
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,826
Thank you, Sheldon,
that must have been hard for you to say.

236
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,429
Well, I mean it. I'm really happy for you.

237
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,130
And that's how you get
a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.

238
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,436
Cheers.

239
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:15,708
That's really nice of you
to try to be happy for Leonard.

240
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:19,146
- Thank you.
- It must've killed you when I went to space.

241
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,557
- Oh, no.
- Buddy, you okay?

242
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,194
Oh, man.

243
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,728
What's going on?

244
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,630
Go ahead, read it.

245
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:40,465
"Raj, I can't come to the party.
This is all just too much for me.

246
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:46,970
I don't think we should
see each other anymore. Sorry. Lucy."

247
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,978
Excuse me.

248
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,706
Raj, I'm so sorry.

249
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,442
Me too.

250
00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:00,049
It did not kill me when you went to space.

251
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,690
Monkeys went to space.

252
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,097
Well, here we are.

253
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,704
Yep.

254
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,097
I'm really gonna miss you.

255
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,833
I'm gonna miss you too.

256
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,001
Penny, we're in the red zone.

257
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,805
The white zone
is for loading and unloading.

258
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,247
We're breaking the law.

259
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:30,115
- There's no space in the white zone, so...
- Anyway...

260
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,590
...we can e-mail and I think
the phone connections are good.

261
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,523
You have to get out of the car now.
I'm not going to jail.

262
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,493
- Would you just relax?
- Oh, I see a space in the white zone.

263
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,997
Quick, circle the airport.

264
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,027
- Did you bring enough inhalers?
- Yeah.

265
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:49,469
And extra Dramamine? You remember
what happened on It's a Small World.

266
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,034
- I'm covered.
- Okay.

267
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,940
Dear Lord, a police officer
is glancing in our direction.

268
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,843
We've been made.

269
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,780
Calm down, I'm getting out.

270
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,881
- I have something I want to give you.
- Oh, Leonard.

271
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,956
It's a locket with Leonard's face in it.

272
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,559
He got it at the mall on clearance.
Move, move, move!

273
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,257
I love you.

274
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,265
I love you too.

275
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,571
Don't worry, officer, they just love
each other, we're not smuggling drugs.

276
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,910
Raj? It's Penny, are you in there?

277
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,575
Hang on.

278
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:40,423
Hey. I'm coming back from the airport.
I wanted to see how you're doing.

279
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,823
That's very nice of you.
Come, come. Come on in.

280
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:48,597
I can't stay long. I left Sheldon in the car
with the window cracked open.

281
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:54,704
He's gonna go through that
activity book in, like, 30 seconds, so...

282
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,534
Are you okay?

283
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,212
No.

284
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,942
I'm so sorry.

285
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,708
It's my fault.

286
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:12,949
I finally found someone who's right for me
and I drove her away.

287
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,683
Raj.

288
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,353
Penny...

289
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,427
...I miss her already.

290
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,958
I know how you feel. I miss Leonard too.

291
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,567
What's...?

292
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:29,468
What is wrong with me?
Why can't I ever have love?

293
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:35,307
- You will.
- No, I won't, I'm unlovable.

294
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,608
That's just the booze talking.

295
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,879
No, it's not.
I haven't had a drink since last night.

296
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,994
You're talking to me.

297
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,860
- I am.
- Aah!

298
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,063
And now I'm crying
for a whole different reason.

299
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,499
Me too.

300
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:09,377
So I guess what I'm saying is,
I get where Lucy's coming from.

301
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,210
- That's great. Do you want some wine?
- No, water is fine.

302
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:17,913
Anyhow, I've been thinking about it a lot,
and I totally see why Lucy did what she did.

303
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,355
I pushed too hard, but if I back off
and give her enough space...

304
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,893
...maybe there's still a future for us.

305
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:27,259
The funny thing about life
is that sometimes something you think...

306
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,400
Does he ever shut up?

307
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,196
But then it turns good again
and that means it's better...

308
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,236
...than if it had never been bad a while.

309
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:38,001
And now things aren't good.
They are in fact...

310
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,701
...very, very bad...

311
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:44,372
...but at least my heart is starting to heal.
Slowly, but surely.

312
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,748
How I cried, it was like a little thunderstorm
on my face.

313
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,754
But I'm a man, okay?
So I need to pull myself together...

314
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,916
...pick up a pen and get it all out
in my journal. I mean...

315
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:59,086
...it's not all bad. Having my heart broken
has allowed me to speak in front of you...

316
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,095
...so, you know, the silver lining.
