Appropriate.

312
00:17:27,621 --> 00:17:29,521
Ha. You're cute.

313
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,419
I'd like to buy a scone.

314
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,924
Oh, I'm sorry, we're out.
We have muffins.

315
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,254
They sound delicious...

316
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:38,761
...but this money is earmarked
for scones.

317
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:42,094
ANGELA: What are you doing?
- Oh, just getting comfortable.

318
00:17:44,238 --> 00:17:46,263
So how long have
you lived in Los Angeles?

319
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:48,441
- L...
- They were out of scones.

320
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,702
I'm talking to someone.
You're being rude.

321
00:17:50,878 --> 00:17:52,368
I'll bet you're an actress.

322
00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:56,243
If not, you should be.
You have a very expressive face.

323
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:57,708
Oh, my God!

324
00:17:58,185 --> 00:18:01,382
Wait, where are you going?
We were doing so well.

325
00:18:01,555 --> 00:18:04,581
She never even got to see my penis.

326
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:08,353
Ta-da!

327
00:18:16,437 --> 00:18:17,768
Who wants some more coffee?

328
00:18:17,938 --> 00:18:19,371
- Thanks, yeah.
- Sure.

329
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,939
Let me help you.

330
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:25,709
Nice to see that the gals
are getting along.

331
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:29,945
"Gals"?
Who are you, Fred Flintstone?

332
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,780
- This trip to India sounds fun.
- Yeah, I think it will be.

333
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,291
Are you concerned your parents
might not approve of Leonard?

334
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:40,620
A little. They're very old-fashioned.

335
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:42,386
Well, I wouldn't worry about it.

336
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:45,930
It's not like you guys
are getting engaged, right?

337
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,326
Oh, my God, no. We're not there yet.

338
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:54,473
Not engaged. Very interesting.
I have to tinkle.

339
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:56,472
You've been in there a lot. You okay?

340
00:18:56,643 --> 00:18:59,544
Yes. Are you writing a book?

341
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,110
Why are you getting upset?

342
00:19:02,282 --> 00:19:04,648
I'm not upset. Maybe you're upset.

343
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,846
What's up with you?

344
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,248
Bernadette?

345
00:19:13,494 --> 00:19:14,654
I can't do this anymore!

346
00:19:15,629 --> 00:19:19,065
I'm a good girl.
I went to Catholic school.

347
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:25,169
Okay, well, it's getting late.
This was terrific.

348
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:27,307
You win. Ha, ha.

349
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:29,069
Bernie?

350
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,007
I think the word
you're looking for is "befuddled."

351
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:44,121
My catapult flings my bishop...

352
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:48,826
...to Howard's queen's gorilla two.

353
00:19:50,597 --> 00:19:56,035
Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad.

354
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,236
And he comes out at...

355
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:04,274
...Leonard's queen's bishop
five-and-a-third.

356
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:06,469
Check on Leonard.

357
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:09,606
Hang on.

358
00:20:09,783 --> 00:20:13,344
When is my pawn allowed
to use the golf cart?

359
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:15,583
When it's done charging.

360
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,519
Or you land on the time machine.

361
00:20:17,691 --> 00:20:19,591
Obviously.

362
00:20:21,328 --> 00:20:23,125
Oh, oh...

363
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:26,824
Beekeeper to king 12.

364
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,699
I capture your pope
and release the swarm.

365
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,365
Checkmate on Sheldon.

366
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,379
I knew I should've given my pope
the jet pack.

367
00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:42,645
Hey, I've got winners.

368
00:21:10,777 --> 00:21:12,836
