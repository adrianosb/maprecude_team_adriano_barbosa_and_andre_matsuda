What exactly do you mean
by embarrass you?

For example, tonight, no one needs to know
that my middle name is Leakey.

is the perfect opportunity...

as a member of her peer group...

the prizes for best costume.

the source of the wave and the observer.

I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.

156
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,023
I wanna get to know Penny's friends.
I just....

157
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:43,688
I don't know
how to talk to these people.

158
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:47,825
-Well, I actually might be able to help.
-How so?

159
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,495
Like Jane Goodall observing the apes...

160
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,404
...I initially saw their interactions
as confusing and unstructured.

161
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:55,601
But patterns emerge.

162
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:59,179
They have their own language,
if you will.

163
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:01,515
Go on.

164
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,017
Well, it seems that the newcomer
approaches the existing group...

165
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,747
...with the greeting,
"How wasted am l? "

166
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:11,689
Which is met
with an approving chorus of "Dude."

167
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:13,588
Then what happens?

168
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:15,390
That's as far as I've gotten.

169
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,197
This is ridiculous.

170
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,358
-I'm jumping in.
-Good luck.

171
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,935
No, you're coming with me.

172
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:24,095
Oh, I hardly think so.

173
00:10:24,273 --> 00:10:25,297
Come on.

174
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:30,072
-Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?
-Yes, but I need a wingman.

175
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:33,044
All right, but if we're going
to use flight metaphors...

176
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:37,879
...I'm much more suited to being the guy
from the FAA analyzing wreckage.

177
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:41,319
Oh, hi.

-Hi.
-Hello.

179

So, what are you supposed to be?

180
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,619

183

184
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,267
Close.

185
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:57,235

186
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,499

188
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,416

189
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:17,056
I still don't get it.

190

I'm the Doppler effect.

191
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:21,561
Okay, if that is some sort
of learning disability...

192
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:23,892
...I think it's very insensitive.

193
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:27,727
Why don't you just tell people
you're a zebra?

194
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:31,665
Why don't you just tell people
you're one of the seven dwarves?

195
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:32,933
Because I'm Frodo.

196
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,044
Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.

197

-Oh, no.
-What?

198
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:41,178
That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.

199
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,045
What do you suppose he's doing here?

200
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:46,416
Besides disrupting the local gravity field.

201
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:50,221
If he were any bigger,
he'd have moons orbiting him.

202
00:11:50,393 --> 00:11:52,623
-Oh, snap.
-Ha-ha.

203
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,388
So I guess we'll be leaving now.

204
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:57,327
Why should we leave?

205
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,095
For all we know, he crashed the party
and Penny doesn't even want him here.

206
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:05,206
You have a backup hypothesis?

207
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:07,274
Maybe they just wanna be friends.

208
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,769
Or maybe she wants to be friends
and he wants something more.

209
00:12:11,947 --> 00:12:13,710
Then he and I are on equal ground.

210
00:12:13,883 --> 00:12:17,148
Yes, but you're much closer to it
than he is.

211
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:22,619
Look, if this was 1 5,000 years ago,
by virtue of his size and strength...

212
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:25,488
...Kurt would be entitled
to his choice of female partners.

213
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,653
And male partners, animal partners,
large primordial eggplants...

214
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,322
...pretty much
whatever tickled his fancy.

215
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:34,596
Yes, but our society
has undergone a paradigm shift.

216
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:39,002
In the information age, Sheldon,
you and I are the alpha males.

217
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,666
-And we shouldn't have to back down.
-True.

218
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:45,041
Why don't you text him that
and see if he backs down?

219
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:47,375
No.

220
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:51,444
I'm going to assert
my dominance face to face.

221
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,712
Face to face?

222
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:56,517
Are you gonna wait for him to sit down
or you gonna stand on the coffee table?

223
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,790
Hello, Penny. Hello, Kurt.

224

Oh, hey, guys.
You having a good time?

225

Given the reaction to my costume...

226
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:07,566
...this party is a scathing indictment
of the American education system.

227

What? You're a zebra, right?

Yet another child left behind.

00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,037
And what are you supposed to be,
an elf?

230
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,440
No, I'm a hobbit.

231
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:18,875
What's the difference?

232
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,040
A hobbit is a mortal, halfling inhabitant
of Middle-earth...

233
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,346
...whereas an elf
is an immortal, tall warrior.

234
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:28,388
So why the hell
would you wanna be a hobbit?

235
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:32,852
Because he's neither tall nor immortal,
and none of us could be the Flash.

236
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:38,125
Well, whatever. Why don't you go hop off
on a quest? I'm talking to Penny here.

-Kurt.
-Okay.

244
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:57,778
I understand your impulse
to try to physically intimidate me.

245
00:13:57,953 --> 00:14:00,387
You can't compete with me
on an intellectual level...

246
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:03,354
...and so you're driven
to animalistic puffery.

No, he's not. You're not, right, Leonard?

250
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:12,700
No, I said animalistic.

251
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:14,358
Of course, we're all animals...

252
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:17,904
...but some of us have climbed
a little higher on the evolutionary tree.

253
00:14:18,073 --> 00:14:20,234
If he understands that, you're in trouble.

for such a little dwarf.

00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:46,612
There, there.

313
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:51,644
God, what is wrong with me?

314
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,253
Nothing, you're perfect.

315
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:54,787
Ecch. I'm not perfect.

316
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:56,254
Yes, you are.

317
00:17:59,094 --> 00:18:01,255
You really think so, don't you?

318
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:17,675
-Penny?
-Yeah?

319
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:21,477
How much have you had
to drink tonight?

320
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:26,615
Just...a lot.

321
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,425
Are you sure that your being drunk
and your being angry with Kurt...

322
00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:34,255
...doesn't have something to do
with what's going on here?

323
00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:37,526
It might.

324
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:40,125
[SlGHS]

325
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:41,929
Boy, you're really smart.

326
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:44,868
Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.

327
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:51,278
Leonard, you are so great.

328
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:53,437
Why can't all guys be like you?

329
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,820
Because if all guys were like me,
the human race couldn't survive.

330
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,021
I should probably go.

331
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:05,450
Probably.

332
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,667
Thank you.

333
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:29,340
That's right, you saw what you saw.

334
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,016
That's how we roll in the Shire.
