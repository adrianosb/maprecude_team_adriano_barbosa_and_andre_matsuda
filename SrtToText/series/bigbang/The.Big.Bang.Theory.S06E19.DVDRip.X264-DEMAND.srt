1
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:06,363
What you doing?

2
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:09,531
You said clean up. I'm cleaning up, heh.

3
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,304
You can't just throw everything
in the closet.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,472
You can tell me what to do
or you can tell me how to do it...

5
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:19,846
...but you can't do both.
This isn't sex.

6
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,651
Well, what if someone looks in there?

7
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:26,724
They're coming over for dinner,
no one will look in the closet.

8
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:30,191
You don't know that. What if someone's
looking for the bathroom?

9
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,387
It could work out.

10
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,499
For all we know,
there's a toilet in there somewhere.

11
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:38,497
Fine. After tonight,
we need to get a handle on this mess.

12
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,696
We should show the closet to Sheldon.

13
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,171
Why?

14
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,833
Ha. Are you kidding?
He's like a savant at organizing.

15
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,206
Everything in his apartment
has a label on it...

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,248
...including his label maker,
which has a label that says "label maker."

17
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:56,845
If you look really close at that label-maker
label, you'll see a label that says "label."

18
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,750
No, he's our guest. We can't ask him
to straighten our closet.

19
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,792
No, we wouldn't ask him.

20
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:08,264
We'd just show him the closet and
let the goblins in his head take it from there.

21
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,363
Hey, guys, come on in.

22
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,132
- Hi.
- Ooh, it smells good.

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,207
Thanks. Sheldon, I know tonight's
the night you eat Thai food.

24
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,608
I went to the Asian market,
got the ingredients, made it from scratch.

25
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,714
Oh, you shouldn't have.

26
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,144
It was my pleasure.

27
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,443
No, you really shouldn't have.

28
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,650
I brought my own.

29
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,148
You stopped and got him takeout?

30
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,656
I had no choice.
He kept kicking the back of my seat.

31
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,919
Sheldon, I've been cooking all day.

32
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,429
Well, now don't you feel silly?

33
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,562
Show him the closet.

34
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,567
These spring rolls are amazing.
Good job, Bernadette.

35
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,492
That's the takeout that Sheldon brought.

36
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:25,008
I'm sure they wouldn't have tasted nearly as
good if I hadn't tried your food first.

37
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:33,651
Howard, did you want your clothes
arranged seasonally or by color?

38
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,614
- Color's fine.
- Wrong, they'll be arranged seasonally.

39
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,490
Aren't you gonna spend
a little time with Amy?

40
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,093
Oh, it's okay, I'm used to it.

41
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:46,665
The other day at Whole Foods, he spent
an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.

42
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,959
And some thanks I got.

43
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,535
The assistant manager chased me out
with an artisanal salami.

44
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,040
His quirks just make you love him more.

45
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,711
Someone please agree with me.

46
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,809
Come on. It's getting late. Time to go.

47
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,683
Oh! Five more minutes.

48
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,387
That's what you said five minutes ago.

49
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,687
Amy and Penny are already in the car,
move it.

50
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,025
How come I never get to do
anything I wanna do?

51
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,359
If he really wants to stay and finish,
I can give him a ride home.

52
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,470
Please, Leonard. He said it's okay.

53
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,498
Sheldon, it's...
Wait, I can go home without you? Bye.

54
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,535
Howard, I have a few questions.

55
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,341
I found three bowling pins.

56
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:40,714
Now, do you juggle these
or are you missing seven?

57
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,884
- Juggle.
- You health nuts kill me.

58
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,028
Oh, my God, it's beautiful!

59
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,893
And look,
you found the juggling pins I hid.

60
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,995
Now, a couple more items.

61
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,161
Howard, I found this letter
from your dad in a box.

62
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:03,207
- Based on content, it could either be filed...
- Wait, you opened this?

63
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,368
I had to find out if it's
personal correspondence or memorabilia.

64
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,106
- Based on the content...
- I couldn't be less interested.

65
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,718
Now, come on, I'll take you home.

66
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:18,186
- Don't you want to know what's in it?
- Lf I did, I would've opened it years ago.

67
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,752
The closet looks great.
Let's get out of here.

68
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,921
Can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons
to sort on the ride?

69
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,125
- Do whatever you want.
- Thanks.

70
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,161
Oh!

71
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,639
Great party.

72
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:41,769
When I first met Howard, he'd pull
his scrotum out of his shorts and say:

73
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,382
"Oh! I sat in gum."

74
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,548
What is your point?

75
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:55,387
It's kind of weird how grown up he is now.
Happily married, throwing dinner parties.

76
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:59,725
Really? You couldn't just say that?
You had to tell the scrotum story?

77
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,327
Trying to paint a picture.

78
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:09,303
It was a nice change of pace,
not eating takeout around a coffee table.

79
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,775
We could throw a dinner party too.
Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.

80
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:17,245
Sure. Just, when you say "dressed up,"
you mean nice clothes, right?

81
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,181
Not like capes and tights and crap.

82
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,583
Yeah.

83
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,485
- Although...
- No.

84
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:36,664
- Howie, you okay?
- Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.

85
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,498
I told you you shouldn't
have espresso after dinner.

86
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,335
I know the little cups make you
feel big, but it's not worth it.

87
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,435
It's this stupid letter.

88
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,374
- Did you read it?
- No.

89
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,611
- You must be curious.
- Of course I'm curious.

90
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:58,382
I haven't seen the man
since I was a little kid.

91
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:01,458
And a letter shows up
on my 18th birthday.

92
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,719
What's that about?

93
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,391
Then why don't you read it?

94
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,464
Maybe he apologizes
or explains why he left.

95
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,362
He abandoned me and my mother.

96
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:14,302
Why does he deserve a chance
to explain anything?

97
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,135
I get that.

98
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,704
So, what do you wanna do with it?

99
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,907
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

100
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,746
Really? Are you sure?

101
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,386
Yep.

102
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,421
Feel better?

103
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,154
I do.

104
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,263
Great.

105
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,565
Neither one of us
is tall enough to reach that.

106
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,037
I can't believe he set it on fire.

107
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,911
Yeah, just seeing that letter
really freaked him out.

108
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:03,579
And he was already having a tough day.
He accidentally wore my pants to work.

109
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,288
I don't know why he was upset.
They were bigger on him than me.

110
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,599
I'm really curious what's in that letter.

111
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,896
Me too, but I guess now we'll never know.

112
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,369
You said Sheldon read it.
Why not ask him?

113
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,602
I can't do that. What kind of wife would I be
if I didn't respect my husband's privacy?

114
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,139
What if I ask
and you happen to be in the room?

115
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,941
- That works.
- Okay.

116
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,401
Blech!

117
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:58,473
It's like cleaning out
the entire building's belly button.

118
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,444
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Oh, hello.

119
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,014
What can I do for you ladies?

120
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,079
- You have something we want.
- Oh, dear.

121
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:12,789
My mother warned me this is what happens
to pretty boys in the big city.

122
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,253
No, we just want information.

123
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:20,092
Oh. Oh, I've got that in spades. Ravage me.

124
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,998
We heard you read the letter
from Howard's father.

125
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,933
- I did.
- What did it say?

126
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,262
I can't tell you that.

127
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:32,377
I'm bound by closet organizer-organizee
confidentiality.

128
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,941
Sheldon, that's not a real thing.

129
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:39,881
Neither is the rule that you have to hold
your girlfriend's hand at the movies.

130
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,179
But that doesn't stop you
from pawing at me...

131
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,347
...like you're a bear
and I'm a trash can full of sweets.

132
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,685
Why do you even care?
Just tell us what it says.

133
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:54,230
Control over the information
contained in that letter belongs to Howard.

134
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,368
By happenstance, I came to know it.

135
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,630
That doesn't give me the right
to disseminate it freely.

136
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:03,798
The letter was found in Bernadette's closet.
Doesn't that count for something?

137
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:08,310
Are you pointing out that California
is a community-property state...

138
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:13,145
...and since Howard and Bernadette are
married, intellectual property in the letter...

139
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,651
...is jointly owned by the two spouses?

140
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,792
Yeah, obviously.

141
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,892
Well played.

142
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,166
Sometimes I don't give you
enough credit, Penny.

143
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,903
Dude, you made the right choice
coming to me for help with this party.

144
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,407
Actually, all I did was invite you.

145
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,579
Well, put your mind at ease.

146
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,376
I'm here to make sure your dinner party
kicks Howard's dinner party's ass.

147
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,213
Now, the first thing we need is a theme.

148
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:52,619
I'm thinking, ah,
turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.

149
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,521
I'm thinking you need a testosterone patch.

150
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,190
Penny and I just wanna
do something low-key.

151
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,132
You know, cocktails, light jazz music,
hors d'oeuvres.

152
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:11,607
So your theme is "I saw a rerun of Mad Men
and bought crab puffs from Trader Joe's"?

153
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,480
I'd hate to miss that. Ahem.

154
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,040
Hey, where have you been?

155
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,809
Oh, Leonard.

156
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,784
If I was prone to sarcasm...

157
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:27,722
...I'd say I was pulling off a major heist
at the Museum of Laundry Baskets.

158
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:33,765
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

159
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,660
I meant, golly, Sheldon,
you've been gone a long time.

160
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,068
Oh, well, I was waylaid
by Penny, Bernadette and Amy.

161
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,506
They made me reveal confidential
information about Howard's father.

162
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,579
- What information?
- I can't tell you that.

163
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:52,912
I'm bound by closet organizer-organizee
confidentiality.

164
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,177
Come on, we won't tell anyone.

165
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:58,152
Sorry, badgering me won't work.
What you should have said is:

166
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,918
"It's pointless to keep this a secret.
Penny will tell."

167
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,323
- Fine, then that.
- All right, I'll tell you.

168
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,691
My goodness,
everyone's on their game today.

169
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:15,631
This is really fun.

170
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,072
Yeah, it's nice to get dressed up
once in a while.

171
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,734
And the hors d'oeuvres are delightful.

172
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,073
- As is the company.
- Aw.

173
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,716
My shirt is itchy, and I wish I were dead.

174
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:31,023
Hey, everybody, before Howard gets here,
let's all just agree...

175
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,215
...to not bring up the letter.
- Of course.

176
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,757
- Sure.
- Absolutely.

177
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,986
If I say yes, can we turn off
that Latin orgy music?

178
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:42,934
It's ridiculous that we still have to
walk up all these flights of stairs.

179
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:47,038
- Yeah, try doing it in heels.
- I am.

180
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,704
Wait. There's something
I have to tell you.

181
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,370
- What?
- I know what was in your dad's letter.

182
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,916
Sheldon, I swear to God
I'm gonna kill you!

183
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,852
Hey!

184
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,887
I made him tell us.

185
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,527
"Us"? Who else knows?

186
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:11,788
- I know.
- Me too.

187
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,021
Same here.

188
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,723
Shame on all of you.

189
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:17,392
You know too.

190
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,868
Couldn't leave him with one friend,
could you?

191
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:24,037
So everybody knows what's in that letter
except for me?

192
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,008
Yes, it's six against one.
Stand down, sir.

193
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:29,773
How could you do this?

194
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,376
I'm sorry.

195
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,713
- Lf you want, we could tell you.
- I don't want to know.

196
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,911
I mean...

197
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,954
I do, but...

198
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,820
I gotta go.

199
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,223
Used me as a human shield?

200
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,596
I panicked.

201
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,738
He looked taller than usual.

202
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,103
Howard?

203
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,470
In here.

204
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,142
Sorry.

205
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,078
I should've left it alone.

206
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,618
It's okay. I'm sorry I ran off like that.

207
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,848
What are you looking at?

208
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,355
Pictures of my dad and me
when I was a kid.

209
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,084
- That's nice.
- I gotta tell you...

210
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,924
...as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing...

211
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:23,091
...he did a hell of ajob
organizing this closet.

212
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:24,860
Look at this.

213
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,302
"Photos of Wolowitz Family
Before Father Left Forever."

214
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:35,641
Look. Check out 9-year-old Howie
with cornrows.

215
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,942
Neither race was happy
to see me with those.

216
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,718
Think you can take a break?

217
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,189
- Why?
- Got a little surprise for you.

218
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,725
Come on.

219
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,795
Oh, honey...

220
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,957
...I am in no mood to have sex tonight.

221
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,905
I mean, I'll lay there
if you absolutely have to have it, but...

222
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,097
Oh.

223
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,642
What are you guys doing here?

224
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:09,303
You weren't sure whether you wanted
to know what was in your dad's letter...

225
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,006
...so we came up with
kind of a cool solution.

226
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:13,811
Oh, yeah? What's that?

227
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,214
It's simple, really.

228
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,481
It occurred to me that
knowing and not knowing...

229
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:23,685
...can be achieved by creating a macroscopic
example of quantum superposition...

230
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:29,859
...the principle that a physical system exists
partially in all its possible states at once.

231
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,900
We were all thinking it, really.

232
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,838
It was kind of the elephant
in the room, so...

233
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:42,937
Anyway, um, I realized
if we each present you...

234
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,606
...with an account of
what your father wrote to you...

235
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:49,720
...only one of which is true,
and we don't tell you which one it is...

236
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,053
...you will forever be
in a state of epistemic ambivalence.

237
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,957
Yeah, and I said if it wasn't epistemic,
we might as well not do it.

238
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,730
Sit down, honey.

239
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,263
- Raj, you're up.
- Okay, um, ahem.

240
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,604
It was a card for your 18th birthday.

241
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:14,872
Inside it said, "Happy birthday, Howard.
I love you. Dad."

242
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,777
Oh, and it was a "Far Side" card...

243
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,818
...the one where the frog has its tongue
stuck to the underside of an airplane.

244
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,781
Thinks it's a fly.

245
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,389
Silly frog. So funny.

246
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,653
Sheldon?

247
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,960
It was a map...

248
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:39,730
...leading to the lost treasure
of famous pirate "One-Eyed Willy."

249
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,206
Nice try. That's the plot for Goonies.

250
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,145
- Told you.
- Don't.

251
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,142
Amy?

252
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,582
You didn't know it...

253
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:58,587
...but your father was in the auditorium
at your high school graduation...

254
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,123
...and he cried
because he was so proud of you.

255
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,152
Really?

256
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,924
Or that's complete poppycock which Amy
made up. It still could be the map.

257
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,129
Penny?

258
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,368
It was a letter explaining that your dad
wasn't who he said he was.

259
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,668
Eventually his other life caught up to him...

260
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,778
...and the only way to keep
you and your mom safe was to leave.

261
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,846
I would like to change mine.

262
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:29,785
The pirate's name was Peg-Leg Antoine.

263
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,057
Now it's completely different from Goonies.

264
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,524
- No, it's not.
- Don't.

265
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,623
Okay, my turn.

266
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:44,130
Your dad wrote about how family
is the most important thing...

267
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,897
...and that you should never
throw it away like he did.

268
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,597
Hmm.

269
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,275
Bernadette?

270
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:57,281
In the envelope was a picture of your dad
holding you the day you were born.

271
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:02,546
On the back he wrote,
"Howard, my son, my greatest gift."

272
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,723
You okay?

273
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,388
Yeah.

274
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,099
I'm terrific.

275
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,337
So?

276
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,673
Which one do you think it is...

277
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,712
...matey?

278
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,043
Actually, I don't wanna know.

279
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,949
I want all of them to be true.

280
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,350
Well, one of them is.

281
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,389
That's pretty cool.

282
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,687
Thank you, guys.

283
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,231
Hey, it's still early.
Why don't we go back and have that party?

284
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,263
- Yeah.
- Okay.

285
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,597
Yeah, surprisingly...

286
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,433
...the letter from your father wasn't
the most interesting thing in the closet.

287
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,701
Bernadette's diary
has some saucy passages.

288
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,574
- Sheldon, don't you dare.
- Nothing to worry about.

289
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,306
Your secret's safe with me.

290
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,246
That's more like it.

291
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:12,081
Although copyright law would allow me
to quote snippets in the context of a review.

292
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,361
I'm glad you're feeling better.

293
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,801
Me too.

294
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:32,569
But if I'd known we were gonna be dancing,
I would've wore my flats.

295
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,478
- Well, this turned out pretty well, huh?
- Yeah, I think so.

296
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:41,847
I agree. That is, if you've never
been to or heard of a party before.

297
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,156
If you'd let me pierce your brain
with a hot needle in the right place...

298
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,418
...you'd be happy all the time.

299
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:57,125
Penny, I have a couple of questions
about your closet.

300
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:01,238
Is there any reason
you're keeping this dead goldfish?

301
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,874
Damn, I forgot to feed him.

302
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,609
And that I had him.

303
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,408
Well, now, did you also have a dog?

304
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:15,679
Because I found what appears to be
a battery-operated chew toy...

305
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,448
Party's over! Party's over!
