1
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:05,754
Feel like trying something new
for dinner?

2
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:08,090
Maybe Indian? Tex-Mex?

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,093
Ever wonder how humans would
be different if they evolved...

4
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,096
...from lizards instead of mammals?

5
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:18,350
Okay, let's talk about that.

6
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,854
As you know,
lizards, cold-blooded animals...

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,023
...lack the ability to sense temperature.

8
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,775
But they do move more sluggishly
when it's cold.

9
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,778
So lizard weathermen
would say things like:

10
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:33,157
"Bring a sweater, it's slow outside."

11
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,244
I love my mind.

12
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,664
We all do. Now, how about dinner?

13
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:45,127
Oh, I would assume we'd enjoy insects
or smaller lizards.

14
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:49,631
We could also pull each other's tails off
and grill them. They'll just grow back.

15
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,010
Oh!

16
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,805
My life-size cardboard
Mr. Spock is here.

17
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,392
I know he wouldn't care
for an outburst of human emotion...

18
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:03,020
...but, oh, goodie, oh, goodie,
oh, goodie.

19
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,693
Commander Spock requesting
permission to be unfolded.

20
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:14,281
- Excuse me.
- Permission granted, commander.

21
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:19,828
...which is why the more intelligent
the monkey, the more feces they fling.

22
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,501
Excuse me, Amy.
Uh, Penny, do you have plans for dinner?

23
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,003
- You guys going somewhere?
- No, just you and me.

24
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,215
You mean, like a date?

25
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,217
Not like a date, a date.

26
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:37,346
Ooh.

27
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,015
Um...

28
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,392
Okay. Sure.

29
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,979
Ooh.

30
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:50,109
Oh, no. They sent the wrong Spock.

31
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,863
Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto.

32
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,892
This is so exciting. If Leonard
and Penny get back together...

33
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,395
...Howard and I can go
on double dates with them.

34
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,275
How come you never invite
Sheldon and me on a double date?

35
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,652
Uh...

36
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,612
How's it going in there, Penny?

37
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,489
Just a sec.

38
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,617
Too much?

39
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,453
- Yes.
- No.

40
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,250
Okay. Just hang on.

41
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,962
You just can't handle her raw sexuality,
can you?

42
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,048
When did you and Leonard break up?

43
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,884
Uh, about two years ago.

44
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,178
Why do you think
he asked you out again?

45
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,346
- I don't know.
- Maybe he's dying.

46
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,432
That would be so romantic.

47
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,601
He's not dying.

48
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,728
Too bad.

49
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:13,025
If he were, she could throw him in bed
and ride him right up until he flatlines.

50
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,739
How about this?

51
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,700
- Maybe.
- Come on.

52
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,620
Yeah, okay, no.

53
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,997
Do you think you'll sleep with him
tonight?

54
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:31,168
Absolutely not. We're just gonna have
dinner and, you know, see how it goes.

55
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,420
If he were dying,
would you sleep with him?

56
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,131
- What?
- Assuming he were dying...

57
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,468
...of something that couldn't
be sexually transmitted.

58
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,679
You know,
like a spear wound to the head.

59
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,348
Okay, he is not dying.

60
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,142
How do you know? Are you a doctor?

61
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,311
You can make-believe though.

62
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,648
Sometimes Howard and I pretend
that his arrhythmia is acting up...

63
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,858
...and I'm a sexy cardiologist...

64
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:59,321
...and the naughty part is
I'm not in his HMO network.

65
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,619
Screw it. I'm not gonna make
a big deal out of this. It's just dinner.

66
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,914
With a dead man. Rawr.

67
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,166
Amy, stop it.

68
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,960
Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

69
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,964
Relax. You know Leonard's always been
crazy about you. It's gonna be great.

70
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:20,676
We've finally gotten to a place where
we can hang out without it being weird.

71
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,096
- If something goes wrong, then what?
- It'll just be Sheldon and me...

72
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,765
...going on a double date
with Howard and Bernadette.

73
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,477
Sure. We'd love that.

74
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,023
Change your clothes,
we got a lot riding on this.

75
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,529
Hmm.

76
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:46,660
I want to build a road,
but I need wood.

77
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,247
Do either of you fellows have wood?

78
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,379
I don't understand the laughter.

79
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,342
The object of Settlers of Catan
is to build roads and settlements...

80
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:07,139
...to do so requires wood.
Now, I have sheep, I need wood.

81
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,310
Who has wood for my sheep?

82
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,024
Okay. How do I look?

83
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,693
More to the point,
why are you doing this?

84
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,904
- What are you talking about?
- You forget what Penny did to you?

85
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,867
It took you two years and defiling my
sister to turn that frown upside down.

86
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,203
I didn't defile your sister,
we had a relationship.

87
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,415
I heard you call her Brown Sugar.

88
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,543
In my book that's defilement.

89
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,464
- You wanna know my opinion?
- Oh, boy, do I.

90
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,508
Sarcasm?

91
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,968
No.

92
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,555
All right, then.

93
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:52,017
The reason you're fixated on
a good-natured simpleton like Penny...

94
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,937
...is that she's the exact opposite
of your first romantic attachment...

95
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,190
...your brilliant, yet intimidating,
mother.

96
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,484
Where on earth did you get that from?

97
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,612
It's in her book
Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.

98
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,991
That doesn't make it true.

99
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,619
It's called non-fiction for a reason,
Leonard.

100
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,704
See you later.

101
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,541
If they make a movie version
of that book...

102
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,628
...you know who should play
Leonard's mother? Sandra Bullock.

103
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,342
- Why?
- Because she's great in everything.

104
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,516
Now, where were we? Oh, yes.
Does anyone have any wood?

105
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,480
Come on. I just want wood.
Why are you making it so hard?

106
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,868
So do they have a name for a first date
with someone you used to go out with?

107
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,372
That's a good question.
How about "awkward"?

108
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,252
- Yeah, that sounds right.
- Yeah? Heh, heh.

109
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:05,215
How about if we pretend we're actually
on a first date? See how that goes.

110
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,300
Okay.

111
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,971
So, Polly, tell me about yourself.

112
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,891
- Heh, heh. It's Penny.
- Oh, sorry. Yeah. Awkward.

113
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,690
Okay, let's see. I'm from Nebraska,
and ever since I was a little girl...

114
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,110
...I dreamed of moving to L.A.
and becoming a movie star.

115
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,655
Anyway, after four years
of acting lessons and waiting tables...

116
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,699
...I've done a hemorrhoid
commercial...

117
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,535
...and a production of Anne Frank
above a bowling alley.

118
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,497
So you know, dreams do come true.

119
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,418
- Your turn.
- Uh, let's see. Ahem. Uh...

120
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,254
I am an experimental physicist
at Caltech.

121
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,632
Most of my research
is with high-powered lasers, and...

122
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,051
Oh, I've just gotten
a big government grant...

123
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,972
...to see if they can be used
to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.

124
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,266
- Wow. Can they?
- Oh, God, no.

125
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,688
But the money's pretty good.

126
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,526
And I used the equipment
to make my own Bat-Signal.

127
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,363
Bat-Signal?
What are you, some kind of nerd?

128
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,992
Not some kind of nerd,
I am the king of nerds.

129
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:22,167
- What does that mean?
- It means if anyone displeases me...

130
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,794
...I don't help them set up their printer.

131
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,048
You are so funny.

132
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,801
Good. Remember that
when I take my shirt off.

133
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,474
- This is nice. I'm so glad we did this.
- Me too.

134
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,063
So, what do you think,
are we gonna get back together?

135
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,773
Whoa, not so fast.

136
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,608
I'm sorry, what did I say?

137
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,320
Leonard, you know I will always
have feelings for you...

138
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,113
- Oh, God.
- What?

139
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,866
You said "always."
You'll always have feelings for me.

140
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,869
- So?
- That sounds like something you'd say...

141
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,413
...if you didn't want a relationship
with someone.

142
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,750
"This isn't working out,
but I'll always have feelings for you."

143
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:08,380
"I'm sorry I slept with your best friend,
but I'll always have feelings for you."

144
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,715
"Here's the thing, Lisa,
I'm into dudes now...

145
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,260
...but I'll always have feelings
for you."

146
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,888
- How would you say it?
- I have feelings for you.

147
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,558
- Same thing.
- No, it's not. "Always" made it worse.

148
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,810
- You're over-thinking this.
- No, I'm not.

149
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,480
- You always over-think things.
- There you go. "Always" made it worse.

150
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,026
See, this is where everything
goes wrong, when we talk.

151
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,281
Well, I don't know how you have
a relationship without talking.

152
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,158
I went out with T.J. for eight months.
We never talked.

153
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,995
To this day, I don't even know
what T.J. stands for.

154
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,417
Wait, if you guys didn't talk...?
Never mind, stupid question.

155
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:51,631
And now that I have some wood...

156
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,970
...I'm going to begin the erection
of my settlement.

157
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,849
He's got to be doing this on purpose.

158
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:07,981
Ooh, eight-thirty. You and Penny decide
to go out and paint the town beige?

159
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,235
You're 30 years old
and you live with your mother.

160
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,864
I guess it didn't go well.

161
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,450
We don't know that. Not to a certainty.

162
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,369
All we know is that Leonard is home.

163
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,251
How about now?

164
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:32,589
Again, not enough evidence.
For all we know, he's being murdered.

165
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,468
Now, back to our game.

166
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,638
You were in the middle of an erection.

167
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,019
Oh, of course.
It's right here in my hand.

168
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,535
What does she want from me now?

169
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,627
- What's up?
- Do not over-think this.

170
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,595
- I don't understand...
- Bup, bup, bup.

171
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,809
- Okay, but earlier it seemed like...
- No talking.

172
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,814
Even during?
Because sometimes I have questions.

173
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,699
Well, that was fun.

174
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,452
Yeah. Except for when
I got the foot cramp.

175
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,162
You hung in there though.

176
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,040
There was a lot at stake.

177
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,377
So, what do you wanna do now?

178
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,423
Well, I wanna go get my asthma inhaler,
but it might ruin the moment.

179
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:04,055
So help me out, here.
How does a miserable date end in sex?

180
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,558
I don't know, it's complicated.

181
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:10,729
I'm pretty smart guy, and right now my
brain has dibs on the blood supply...

182
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,647
...so give it a go.

183
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,400
Okay. It's just...

184
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:19,154
At that restaurant when you said
you wanted us to be together again...

185
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:23,450
...it got very real, very fast
and I panicked.

186
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,786
Why? What are you afraid of?

187
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:31,040
Well, what if we do go out and I do
something stupid and dump you again?

188
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,292
What if I dump you?

189
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,340
Come on, be serious.

190
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,803
Well, how about if we don't think
about this as a relationship?

191
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,473
It could be more like
a new version of software.

192
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,349
Penny and Leonard 2.0.

193
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,436
We can test it internally,
shake out the bugs...

194
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,398
...and if we both feel it's solid,
then we'll roll it out to the public.

195
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,735
We don't tell people
we're back together?

196
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,446
Exactly.
We pretend like our date went badly.

197
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,490
Well, we don't really have to pretend.

198
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,951
And we let them think that we decided
to just be friends...

199
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,912
...and that everything's cool.

200
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,371
Okay. Great.

201
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,710
Hey, I just remembered.
I still got one of your inhalers.

202
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,215
I can't believe you kept this.

203
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,801
I was gonna throw it away,
but I just couldn't.

204
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,386
That is so sweet.

205
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,013
Heh.

206
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:34,145
In 25 to 30 minutes I'm gonna show you
how much this means to me.

207
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,493
- Leonard?
- Yeah, hi.

208
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,496
How's it going?

209
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,999
Can't complain, thanks for asking.

210
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,462
What were you doing out
at 3:00 in the morning?

211
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,258
Well... What are you doing up?

212
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,844
I was using the bathroom.

213
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,681
Yeah, well, so was I.

214
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,769
Really? I didn't see you in there.

215
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,065
Obviously.

216
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,695
When I saw that you were in ours,
I went and used another one.

217
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,615
Where?

218
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,326
Uh, the gas station across the street.

219
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,999
- In your pajamas?
- Yes.

220
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,084
Without shoes?

221
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,504
Yes.

222
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,174
On a cold winter's night?

223
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,554
Yes.

224
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:56,644
That seems unlikely.
Did you bring your asthma inhaler?

225
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,981
Uh, uh, yes, I did.

226
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,361
Well, then I guess it's plausible.

227
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,949
- Hang on a second, mister.
- What?

228
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:15,997
After you used the facilities at the gas
station, did you make a purchase?

229
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,749
What?

230
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,753
It's customary when using the restroom
at a retail establishment...

231
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,839
...to make a small purchase. Did you?

232
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,634
No.

233
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,219
Here's $2.

234
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,725
Go buy some beef jerky.

235
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,859
I don't want beef jerky.

236
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,238
It's not about you.

237
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,824
It's about a poor immigrant
from Pakistan...

238
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,328
...trying to make his way in America
by working the graveyard shift...

239
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,997
...at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.

240
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,752
Fine.

241
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,548
Needy baby, greedy baby, indeed.

242
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,718
Leonard will be here in a moment.

243
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,971
He's looking for
a different parking space.

244
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,890
- Why?
- We were next to a car with an...

245
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,893
..."ask me about my grandchildren"
bumper sticker...

246
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:23,106
...and I was afraid if we ran into them
on the way out, I'd be obligated to do so.

247
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,986
I'm so disappointed
it didn't work with him and Penny.

248
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:34,325
Me too. Out of deference to them,
let's not flaunt our happy relationship.

249
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:38,955
You have a keen insight into
the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler.

250
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,460
We are next to a Subaru
with a Gore-Lieberman bumper sticker.

251
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,089
Well, I doubt they'd wanna
talk about that, so we're fine.

252
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,677
I'm surprised to see you here
after it went so badly with Penny.

253
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,847
Well, hey, we're grown-ups.
We can still be friends.

254
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:59,434
Boy, I don't know if I could be friends
with Howie if we broke up.

255
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:03,104
- Why not?
- I'm a very vengeful person.

256
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:08,526
- Really?
- With access to weaponized smallpox.

257
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,365
Let me get you some water. You need
menus, or you know what you want?

258
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:18,327
Leonard knows what he wants, but it
looks like he's not gonna get it from you.

259
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,622
- Howard.
- No, that's okay, Bernadette.

260
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,833
Sometimes these things
just don't work out.

261
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,129
Yeah. It's all good. We'll always
have feelings for each other.

262
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,842
Oh. That's nice.

263
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,970
See? She knew what "always" meant.

264
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,723
Wow, you're like a dog with a bone,
aren't you?

265
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,310
- I'm just making a point.
- Is the point you don't know...

266
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,188
- ...when to let something go?
- People, people, please.

267
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,398
Before you say something
you both regret...

268
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,025
...I'd like to place my order.

269
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,529
Yeah, hang on, Sheldon.
You know why we can't be together?

270
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,491
- Because you always have to be right.
- That is not true.

271
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,120
I gotta go with Leonard on this.
He is wrong more than anyone I know.

272
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:05,333
You know what, I just realized
I'm on a break. I'll get someone else.

273
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,628
Promise me
when our new waitress comes over...

274
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,632
...you will not start a complicated,
on-again, off-again relationship with her.

275
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,300
Because I'm very, very hungry.

276
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,022
Unbelievable.

277
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,404
Mind explaining why you were being
a jerk at the restaurant?

278
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,741
I was trying to act like we weren't
seeing each other. That was the plan.

279
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,536
The plan was to tell people
we decided to stay friends.

280
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:45,790
But that's a little hard to do when
you're always being such a toolbag.

281
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,668
I don't have to stand here
and take this crap.

282
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,378
Where do you think you're going?

283
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:53,548
Isn't sex after fighting
kind of what we do now?

284
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,593
Yeah, kind of, yeah.

285
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,186
- What are we doing?
- What do you mean?

286
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,107
Every scenario I play out
for you and me ends badly.

287
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,568
Because you over-think everything.

288
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,736
Leonard, are you listening to me?

289
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,990
- What? Yeah.
- This is a disaster.

290
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:23,744
I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy
Mr. Spock cardboard standee.

291
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:28,082
Why would I feel safer with
Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?

292
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,670
I don't know.
He was pretty badass on Heroes.

293
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,632
You're right. I'll give him a shot.

294
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,802
Hang on.

295
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:43,014
- Penny, you have plans for dinner?
- You guys going somewhere?

296
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,308
No, I mean just you and me.

297
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,810
Ooh.

298
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,271
Have you thought this through?

299
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,609
Yes. And I think we should go anyway.

300
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,113
No, can't do it.
Sorry, Quinto, you're going back.

301
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,999
If you and Leonard get back together,
Sheldon and I will finally have...

302
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,502
- ...someone to go on double dates with.
- What about me and Howard?

303
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,880
Fine, we can double with you too.

304
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,132
So insecure.

305
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,220
Where are you guys going to eat?

306
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,889
