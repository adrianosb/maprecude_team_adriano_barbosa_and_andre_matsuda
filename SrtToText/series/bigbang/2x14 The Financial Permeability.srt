These theaters have to be eliminated.

Yes, but they have no Icee machines.

The seats are terrific.

No lumbar support can compensate for that.

Well, there you go. Problem solved.

311
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:40,130
A successful quest. Now let's find
a gas station with a clean bathroom.

312

No, the problem isn't solved.

He just blew us off.

314

I've got it.

315
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:50,413
He didn't remember me, because the last
time we met I was in a Halloween costume.

316
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:55,088
- Come on, Leonard, let's go.
- No. You can leave if you want to.

- I'm gonna see this through.
- Okay.

318

I guess technically that was my fault.

I'm not leaving here
without Penny's money.

What happened to your backup?

I don't need backup.

I have right on my side.

323

And I'm wearing cargo shorts
under my pants.

Congratulations.

You may not have succeeded
in getting cash...

00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,267
...but you did secure
a formal acknowledgment of the debt.

notarized.

- Nice hat.
- You know?

It's kind of a fashionable look
these days.

Maybe if you're working on a tuna boat.

- Hello, Penny.
- Sheldon, here is your money.

Thank you very much, it helped a lot.

- No.
- Darn.

I can't seem to get the hang of that.

Hey, I know it's none of my business,
but where did the money come from?

341
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,846
Well, I cut back my expenses
like you said...

342
00:19:34,022 --> 00:19:36,115
...and picked up more hours
at the restaurant.

The biggest thing was, out of the blue,
Kurt shows up...

...and gives me the money he owes me.

Did he say why?

Yes. He said he was feeling guilty

Did he give any reason
as to why he came to this moral epiphany?

Nope. I just think he's really changed.
