1
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:06,497
I was reading about this jellyfish
that never dies.

2
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:09,869
Instead it reverts to its asexual state
and then grows up again.

3
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:13,477
We thought my 90-year-old grandfather
had reverted to an asexual state...

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,877
...but the lawsuit from his Jamaican
caregiver proved us all wrong.

5
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,849
My point is, immortality is not only
a possibility, it is real.

6
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,386
Only if you're this jellyfish,
which periodically...

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,388
...reverts to a mass
of undifferentiated protoplasm.

8
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:29,858
If I could keep my Gmail account,
I'd be okay with that.

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,828
- Hello, fellas.
- Hey, buddy.

10
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:35,126
- How are you?
- Remember we were trying to figure out...

11
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:38,236
...what that smell coming from
Professor Tupperman's office was?

12
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,531
- Yeah.
- Turns out it was Tupperman.

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,532
Dead at his desk for two weeks.

14
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,871
- Terrible.
- Oh, my God.

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,741
In lieu of flowers,
the department chair is asking...

16
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,610
...that everyone donate a bottle
of Febreze.

17
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:55,119
If we're going to change the topic
from jellyfish...

18
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:59,553
...I'd be okay with brine shrimp
or the history of the unicycle.

19
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,193
Show a little compassion. The man died.

20
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,056
And turned into a puddle of goo.

21
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:08,098
Now, we can either sit around
and cry over spilt professor...

22
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:13,601
...or we can rejoice in the knowledge
that a tenured position has just opened up.

23
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,468
I choose to do the latter.

24
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,844
Excuse me,
the whole tenure system is ridiculous.

25
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:23,880
A guaranteed job for life only encourages
the faculty to become complacent.

26
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,984
If we really want science to advance...

27
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,450
...people should have chips
implanted in their skulls...

28
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,454
...that explode
when they say something stupid.

29
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:38,828
Well, I believe people do their best work
when they feel safe and secure.

30
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,628
If you need my nose,
you'll find it firmly lodged...

31
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,363
...up the rectum of the tenure committee.

32
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,105
You PhDs gonna go suck up like Kripke?

33
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:55,975
No. I mean, I'll apply,
but I'm not gonna stoop to playing politics.

34
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,309
Yeah, me neither.
It should be about the work.

35
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:01,510
And if I can't get tenure,
I'd like to see you or Sheldon get it.

36
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:06,020
Raj, don't dangle false hope
in front of Leonard like that.

37
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:09,791
Excuse me, but I think I'm just as qualified
as you are.

38
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,258
- So "tenured" means ajob for life?
- Yep.

39
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,656
And you can't get fired...

40
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,856
...even if you're bad at it?
- Mm, not really.

41
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:50,832
Wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty
waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.

42
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:55,104
While I disagree
with the premise of tenure...

43
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,105
...if they gave it to me,
it wouldn't diminish my output.

44
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:02,610
I'm like the sun. I can't turn this off.

45
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:08,109
- Are Rajesh and Leonard competing as well?
- Mm-hm.

46
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,348
Do they know they don't stand a chance
because you're so great?

47
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,253
Well put.

48
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,690
I must say, I go back and forth
on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing...

49
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:21,526
...but those moments when you worship me
really keep you in the running.

50
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,136
It would be nice to have the income,
stop taking money from my parents.

51
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,002
Money from family does come
with strings attached.

52
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,872
You have no idea.

53
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:38,949
They buy me a new BMW for my birthday,
but can I get seat warmers? No.

54
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,385
"If you want a warm butt,
pay for it yourself."

55
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,114
Well, maybe I will, old man.

56
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,719
I think that's enough wine for now.

57
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,832
I just keep thinking how cool it would be
if I called my mom...

58
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,629
...and told her that I got tenure at CalTech.
- She'd be proud, huh?

59
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:02,069
Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call. Heh.

60
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,545
My primary concern
with being granted tenure...

61
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,943
...is living with an insanely jealous
roommate after the fact.

62
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:15,143
I might need to sleep with a gun
under my pillow. Or a chainsaw.

63
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:20,154
Or you take advantage of your newfound
economic stability and move out...

64
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,195
...buy a house, get married, start a family.

65
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,996
Or the chainsaw.

66
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:38,205
And I will return to New Delhi in triumph
atop a bejeweled white elephant.

67
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:43,612
And you know what will be on
that elephant's back? A seat warmer.

68
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,381
"No, Father, you may not have a ride!"

69
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,624
I'm gonna make some coffee.

70
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,092
So who do you schmooze
to get this deal?

71
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,732
I'm not gonna schmooze anybody.
I'm gonna let my work speak for itself.

72
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,236
- That's great. That shows a lot of integrity.
- Thank you.

73
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,802
I'm a naive idiot, right?

74
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:08,965
Oh, good, you heard me.

75
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,977
If you really want tenure,
cozy up to the people making the decision.

76
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,974
Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.

77
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,648
You don't say.

78
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,214
But I suppose it wouldn't hurt
to know who's on the committee.

79
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:28,485
Let's see. Janine Davis. Oh, dear.

80
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,029
- Is that a problem?
- Well...

81
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,995
Even you. You're a slave.

82
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,998
I'm a what?

83
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,276
Not sure, it could go either way.

84
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:59,419
- Hey, Mrs. Davis.
- Hey.

85
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,388
Dr. Hofstadter.

86
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:05,530
Just thought I'd come down and
start getting ready for swimsuit season.

87
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,959
Good for you.

88
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,534
Not that you need it.
I bet you look great in a swimsuit.

89
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,301
Thank you.

90
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,872
I've got what my father
used to call furniture disease.

91
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,534
My chest is falling into my drawers. Ha, ha.

92
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,952
I'm not, uh, familiar with this model.
How do I make it start?

93
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,383
You push "start."

94
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,451
Right. Heh.

95
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,792
This one might be broken.

96
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,631
You have to move.

97
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:46,904
Got it. Heh.

98
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,932
Oh. Heh, heh.

99
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,646
Oh, yeah.

100
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,220
Yeah, now I'm feeling it.

101
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,520
Oh, this is great.

102
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,658
I could do this for the rest of my life.

103
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:11,520
Hey, speaking of things you do
for the rest of your life...

104
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,530
...uh, did I read that you're
on that tenure committee?

105
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,859
Yep.

106
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,664
I gotta get a home gym.

107
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,999
I'm sure you have a lot
of good applicants.

108
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,869
I just wanted to say hi...

109
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,639
...and let you know
that I'll be throwing my hat in the...

110
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,875
...ring.

111
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,452
- All right, I'll keep an eye out for that.
- Yeah.

112
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,324
Hey, Hofstadter.

113
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:43,859
Funny seeing you here
for the first time in ever.

114
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,788
Go away.

115
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,460
- Janine the machine, let's do this.
- Hey, Barry.

116
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,801
Oh, look at that. Burned a whole calorie.

117
00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:00,345
I guess you got here early to burn off
that banana bread I baked you.

118
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,980
- Yeah, it was delicious. Thank you.
- No, my pleasure.

119
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:06,913
If you like banana bread,
I've got a great recipe.

120
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,054
The trick is in fresh ground...

121
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,780
I'll e-mail it to you.

122
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,517
All right, I'm warm.
Ready to kick it up a notch?

123
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:16,752
Let's go.

124
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,399
That's enough cardio for me, guys.

125
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,797
Gonna stretch out
before I hit the weights.

126
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,904
You okay?

127
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,873
Call someone.

128
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,814
Good day, Mrs. Davis.

129
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,183
This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali
from the Astrophysics Department.

130
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,190
Don't be alarmed, I'm not really in space.

131
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:56,634
Anywho, I'd like to take this opportunity
to tell you about myself.

132
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:01,568
So sit back, relax,
and enjoy the following 90-minute video.

133
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,709
Oh, come on.

134
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,704
Born in New Delhi,
the third son of an itinerant gynecologist...

135
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,851
...I showed early signs of genius.

136
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,419
At the age of 5,
I discovered a celestial object...

137
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:20,388
...which later turned out to be the moon.

138
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,064
Mrs. Davis. Mrs. Davis. Mrs. Davis.

139
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,859
Oh, God, they're everywhere.

140
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,795
Come in.

141
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:36,168
- Dr. Cooper, how can I help you?
- Yes, hello. I'm fine.

142
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:42,942
I understand you may have a bad
impression of me, so I bought you a gift.

143
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:46,016
- Dr. Cooper, that's not necessary.
- It's too late.

144
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,647
Get ready to like me.

145
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,390
Roots?

146
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,131
The tragic history of slavery in America.
Fun for the whole family.

147
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,899
Why would you think
this is an appropriate gift?

148
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,371
Um...

149
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,341
Well...

150
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,172
You are black, right?

151
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,808
This meeting has come to an end.

152
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,514
Because you wanna start watching it
right now. Copy that.

153
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,659
Let's see.

154
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,557
Up next on the tenure committee is...

155
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,492
Professor Woo.

156
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:37,362
Get ready for the complete works
of Jackie Chan.

157
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,477
Gentlemen.

158
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,971
- Where have you been?
- Nurse's office.

159
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,517
- Asthma attack?
- Asthma, heart. Some kind of attack.

160
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,276
I'm fine, though.

161
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,785
You guys going to
Professor Tupperman's memorial?

162
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,719
- Probably not.
- Barely knew him.

163
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,827
Yeah, you wouldn't wanna look like you guys
are brownnosing the tenure committee...

164
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,691
...who will all be there.

165
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:11,060
- Oh, yeah.
- Meerkats.

166
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:21,807
I won't be able to make our date night
this Thursday, so bad news for you.

167
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,249
You better have a good excuse this time.

168
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,647
Because trimming Q-tips to fit your ears
right is obvious nonsense.

169
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:34,492
First of all, when you say things like that,
people think you're crazy.

170
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,457
Second, the reason I'm canceling...

171
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:40,154
...is because I have to attend a memorial
service for Professor Tupperman.

172
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,396
- That sounds like a long and tedious evening.
- Ah, it will be.

173
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:46,264
Honestly, if I must endure
a long and tedious evening...

174
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,996
...I'd rather it be with you on date night.

175
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:53,578
But I have no choice.
The tenure committee is going to be there.

176
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,509
Oh, well, in that case,
perhaps I should come along.

177
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,246
Now that I think about it,
that would be helpful.

178
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,509
Of course it would.

179
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,349
I'm well versed in academic politics,
and as a respected scientist...

180
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,923
...I can only raise your stock
as a candidate.

181
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,356
Actually, I meant you could drive me.

182
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,862
But if it makes you happy,
that other stuff too.

183
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:23,407
- Do anything interesting today?
- Not really. I was out shopping with Amy.

184
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:26,305
She wanted me to help her find something
for this memorial.

185
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,810
What, Sheldon's going to be there?
We all promised we weren't gonna go.

186
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,143
- Oh. What ajerk.
- I know.

187
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,217
I was hoping to go
without anyone finding out.

188
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:39,451
Well, since Amy's going, do you want me
there, you know, to support you?

189
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:43,425
Oh. That's nice, but it's just gonna be
a room full of boring old men.

190
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,290
I'm not sure how much help you'd be.

191
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:49,160
Okay. I'm just gonna tie my shoe
while you think about that. Ahem.

192
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,737
Oh, yeah. No, thanks.
That would be great help.

193
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,983
- You realize you might kill some of them.
- Then you all can get tenure.

194
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:13,991
Come on, Daddy.
All the other scientists have seat warmers.

195
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,862
This is so humiliating.
I've got to get tenure.

196
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:24,265
Okay, let's meet halfway. How about I
cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week?

197
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:28,098
Looks like we're both going to be
living like animals.

198
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,610
Let's go over our emotional responses
one last time.

199
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,837
Okay.

200
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,381
Professor Tupperman is dead
and that makes us?

201
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,312
Sad.

202
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:45,580
The fact that there are so many people here
doesn't make us cranky and claustrophobic.

203
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,589
- It makes us?
- Glad.

204
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,320
Giving Mrs. Davis the box set
of Roots was?

205
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,658
Bad.

206
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,533
- However...
- No.

207
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,100
Fine, bad.

208
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,403
Unbelievable.

209
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,871
You have some nerve showing up
just to schmooze the tenure committee.

210
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,134
You're here.

211
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,314
Excuse me, I'm here to pay my respects
to Professor Tupperware...

212
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,914
...or whatever his name is.

213
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,746
So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.

214
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:21,526
Well, well, well, Sheldon,
fancy meeting you here.

215
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:25,390
I guess the train store in Glendale
wasn't having a cotillion after all.

216
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,232
And you.
You said you weren't coming here either.

217
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,995
I have a thick accent.
You don't know what I said.

218
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:37,734
- I'd like to know why Penny's here.
- I'm here to support my man, just like you.

219
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,137
What are you going to do?

220
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,905
Take people's drink orders
and get them wrong?

221
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,440
Do it.

222
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,359
What? Did she do it yet?

223
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:08,299
She plans on flirting with members of the
tenure committee to further Leonard's cause.

224
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,475
Well, that's a fine how-do-you-do.

225
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,372
Don't just stand there,
take your breasts out.

226
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,683
Ooh, meerkat fight.

227
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,788
You're all wasting your time.
Sheldon is the most qualified for the job...

228
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,448
...and no amount of gravity-defying bosom
is gonna change that.

229
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:33,293
Seriously, is that tape?
Like, how are they staying up like that?

230
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,960
Way to hit them with both barrels.

231
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,830
You two should be ashamed
of yourselves.

232
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,405
Using women to advance your cause
with sexuality...

233
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,406
...and whatever Amy plans on doing.

234
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,404
Are you implying my girlfriend...

235
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,913
...has no sexuality to exploit?
- Yes.

236
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,085
- Okay, because that wasn't clear.
- Sheldon.

237
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,721
What? That was ambiguous.

238
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,416
Well, now it's biguous.
What are you gonna do about it?

239
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,824
- Um...
- Talk some smack about his mother.

240
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,158
Yes, of course, he wouldn't like that at all.

241
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,029
Last night, I was feeling in need
of sexual release...

242
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,433
...when I happened to come across
your mother.

243
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,741
- Okay, guys, what are we doing here?
- I don't know what you're doing...

244
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:24,848
...but I was about to insinuate that
I had coitus with Raj's mother for a dollar.

245
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:30,045
Well, you do what you want,
but I don't wanna lose my friends over tenure.

246
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,484
- Friends are forever.
- Ahem. So is tenure.

247
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,352
Walk.

248
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,161
I'm just gonna go home
and let my work speak for itself.

249
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,265
You're right. This is beneath me.

250
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,300
Like your mother was last night.

251
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:47,630
How about it, Sheldon?

252
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,074
What do you think I should do?

253
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,177
Well, you'll always
be an academic success...

254
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,682
...but I seriously question
whether you'll make any more friends.

255
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,783
Oh, I don't want any more, but let's go.

256
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,925
Are you kidding?
I would love to babysit for you.

257
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,027
- I could not ask you to do that.
- Nonsense, children love me.

258
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,189
Something about me
just makes them laugh and laugh.

259
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,867
No, we cannot lose to that jerk.

260
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,240
- Yeah, screw it. I'm going in.
- Hold on.

261
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,806
"Screw it, I'm going in"
is what I said to your mother last night.

262
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,852
Don't worry, I didn't really say that.

263
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,756
I find the concept of coitus ridiculous
and off-putting.

264
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,589
Should have taken my breasts out
while I had the chance.

265
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:59,871
Mrs. Davis. Mrs. Davis. Mrs. Davis.

266
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,372
I know you're in there.
I saw your car in the parking lot.

267
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,142
What?

268
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,150
I just found out
that you recommended myself...

269
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:14,291
...Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali
to be on the short list for tenure.

270
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,324
Well, despite your quirks...

271
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,896
...the three of you are very accomplished
in your respective fields.

272
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:27,098
I don't know what you mean by quirks,
but I do want to express my gratitude.

273
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,799
- You didn't bring another gift, did you?
- No, no, I learned my lesson.

274
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,910
- I understand that was inappropriate.
- Good.

275
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,571
- Anyway, thank you.
- You're welcome.

276
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,152
I'm gonna pretend that didn't happen.

277
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,821
Right on, sister.
