1
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:05,236
- They are not.
- They are too.

2
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:08,202
Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed
by all the data.

3
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:11,206
You're just clinging to it
out of intellectual stubbornness.

4
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:15,438
No, you're displaying a shocking ignorance
of the subject matter.

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,742
Mummies and zombies
are the exact same thing.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,444
Oh, yeah?

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,349
Mummies are wrapped in bandages.

8
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:26,047
That's called a fashion choice.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,085
All right. You brought this on yourself.

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,197
- Sheldon, get him.
- Lf a zombie bites you...

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,231
...you turn into a zombie.

12
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,062
However, if a mummy bites you...

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,864
...all you turn into
is some schmo with a mummy bite.

14
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:43,531
So, like a zombie that's been eaten
from the waist down...

15
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,541
...you, sir, have no leg to stand on.

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,448
- Good boy. Here's a cookie.
- Oh, thank you.

17
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,844
Hey, fellas, what's going on?

18
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,610
Mummies and zombies again.

19
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,549
Ahh. They're not the same thing.

20
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,284
You get a cookie too.

21
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,484
Thanks.

22
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,594
Guess who picked up his new car
this morning.

23
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,664
Congratulations.
Does it have that new-car smell?

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,425
Yep. For as long
as I can keep my mother out of it.

25
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:14,130
If you wanna check it out later,
it's parked right out front, Space 294.

26
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:17,673
- I'm sorry, 294?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,879
That's my parking spot.

28
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,614
Why do you have a parking spot?
You don't have a car. You don't drive.

29
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,309
It doesn't matter. That's my spot.

30
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,886
Maybe they reassigned it
because you never use it.

31
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,618
I'm not using my nipples either.
Maybe they should reassign those.

32
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:39,123
Sheldon, someday, if you get a car...

33
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,664
...I'm sure they'll give you
another parking space.

34
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,927
I don't want another parking space.
I want my parking space.

35
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:49,199
Well, it's perfect. It's a corner spot,
cutting the risk of door dings in half.

36
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,603
It's a mere 28 steps
from the building entrance.

37
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:55,144
The nearby tree provides shade
on hot days...

38
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:58,044
...and is also home
to a delightful squirrel...

39
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:02,277
...which is fortuitous
because most squirrels are real jerks.

40
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,121
Fun story.
Meanwhile, you still don't have a car.

41
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,818
Don't try to change the subject.

42
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:13,328
This is about a parking space.
It has nothing to do with cars.

43
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,565
Are you listening to yourself?

44
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,794
I always listen to myself.
It's one of the great joys of my life.

45
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,800
- Now get your car out of my spot.
- Nope.

46
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,035
Very well, you leave me no choice.

47
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,751
What are you looking at,
you stupid squirrel?

48
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,049
President Seibert, listen to reason.

49
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,221
Yeah, I understand
I don't use the parking spot.

50
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,686
That's not the point. L...

51
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:15,588
Yes, I'm aware you told me
not to call you at home.

52
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,562
But you didn't answer the door.

53
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,565
And I know you were there
because I saw you through the mail slot.

54
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,635
Yeah, well, that's some salty language.

55
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,773
May I remind you, you're the president
of a major university...

56
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,533
...not the president
of the Potty Mouth Club.

57
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,006
There it is again.

58
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,738
Do you kiss your mother
with that mouth?

59
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,377
Oh. Well, I'm sorry for your loss.

60
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,644
Good night, sir.

61
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,445
Unbelievable.

62
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,016
He says Wolowitz deserves my spot...

63
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,716
...because he's a high-profile asset
to the university.

64
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:51,590
Well, he's not wrong. Howard did go
to the International Space Station.

65
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,060
That was five weeks ago.

66
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,427
How much longer
is he gonna milk that cow?

67
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,966
Sheldon, let it go. It's not a big deal.

68
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,140
No. No, this is a slippery slope, Leonard.

69
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,969
See, it starts with a parking space.
Where does it end?

70
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,669
It's like my dad always said,
"First they say you can't drink and drive.

71
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,405
Next you can't let your 10-year-old
take the wheel...

72
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,245
...while you sleep one off
in the backseat."

73
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,855
All that story does
is make me feel bad for your mother.

74
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,963
Leonard, you're my best friend.
Why don't you ever take my side?

75
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,662
Because I can never understand
your side!

76
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:32,969
Give it back.

77
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,766
I'm sorry,
but could you be more specific?

78
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:39,138
My Iron Man helmet.
Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.

79
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,210
Oh, that.

80
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:46,009
Well, see, I wanted it
and you weren't using it.

81
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,289
Apparently,
those are the rules we live by now.

82
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:55,525
Payback, it truly is the B-word, isn't it?

83
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:00,454
Sheldon, that is a $500
limited-edition collectible...

84
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:01,964
...and I want it back.

85
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:05,103
Well, I'd love to help you out,
but unfortunately...

86
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,637
...I'm using it.

87
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:15,476
Fine. I'm taking your diploma.

88
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,679
Go ahead.
That's the only doctorate you'll ever get.

89
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,155
It smells funny in here.

90
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,925
We're so proud of you, Amy.
Your first bikini wax.

91
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,859
Yeah.

92
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,664
So how you doing?

93
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,898
Oh, a little sensitive, but not bad.

94
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,238
Does it always take that long?

95
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,744
Uh, no, they don't usually have to go out
and get more wax.

96
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,184
I feel like I'm 5 pounds lighter.

97
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,011
Really? Only 5?

98
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,587
Anybody want a drink?

99
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,260
- Sure.
- Okay.

100
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:06,159
So did you spend last night hearing
about this silly parking-space fight too?

101
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,062
For hours. Fortunately,
I couldn't understand most of it...

102
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,964
...because Sheldon was wearing
that stupid robot mask.

103
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:16,032
Howard was so angry, I had
to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream...

104
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,267
...to get him to fall asleep.

105
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,709
I guess this is what we get for being
with two testosterone-fueled alpha males.

106
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,952
At some point,
they're bound to lock horns.

107
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,587
I'm assuming these are some kind
of horns they bought at Comic-Con?

108
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,427
I'm really sorry
they took Sheldon's spot away.

109
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,620
He shouldn't have to suffer
just because Howard's a big deal now.

110
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:42,562
I know. Sheldon should just let Howard
have his little moment in the sun.

111
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,601
What's that supposed to mean?

112
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,562
Well, I mean,
Howard's never gonna go to space again...

113
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,572
...but Sheldon will always be a genius.

114
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,808
You're right. And I'm sure Sheldon
will get a fancy parking spot again...

115
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:59,314
...if and when he makes
a worthwhile contribution to science.

116
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,948
- Lf and when?
- Maybe we should change the subject.

117
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,990
Amy, how are your lady parts?
Still chilly down there?

118
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,756
Hang on. None of Sheldon's theories
have ever been definitively proven.

119
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,491
My husband actually went
to outer space.

120
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,363
That's an impressive accomplishment.

121
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,936
He's now an inspiration
to millions of Americans...

122
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,304
...who know you don't have to be special
or even qualified to go into space.

123
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:28,776
You know, I remember the first time
I got a bikini wax.

124
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:32,849
My sister did it with melted Crayolas
and duct tape.

125
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,950
Yeah, it's a bad idea.

126
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,288
Gosh, Amy. I'm sensing a little hostility.

127
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:44,953
Is it maybe because, like Sheldon's work,
your sex life is also theoretical?

128
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,298
Damn.

129
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,802
Well, at least when we do make love...

130
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,531
...Sheldon won't be thinking
about his mother.

131
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:02,208
That is a cleverly veiled reference
to Howard's lifelong obsession...

132
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,645
...to crawl back into her spacious womb.

133
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:10,651
Anyway, to this day, I still can't see a box
of crayons without crossing my legs. Ha, ha.

134
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,648
I don't have to take this.

135
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,727
I'm gonna go home
and have sex with my husband right now.

136
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:20,160
Maybe I'll let him do it to me
in the parking spot.

137
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,398
Which sounds dirty
but I didn't mean it that way.

138
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,104
Okay, here's another one.

139
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,710
If a zombie bites a vampire...

140
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,574
...and the vampire bites a human...

141
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:39,683
...does the human become a vampire
or a zombie?

142
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,580
Or a zompire?

143
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,351
Sheldon?

144
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,356
Cookie?

145
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,220
- I don't have any.
- Well, I'm not giving it away.

146
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,192
- Hi, Sheldon.
- Aah!

147
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,202
He's in my spot.

148
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,105
Leonard, make him stop being naked
in my spot.

149
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,207
Howard, what are you doing?

150
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,607
He wasn't using it...

151
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:17,647
...and I needed a nice cool piece of leather
to wiggle my naked ass on.

152
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,282
Get off there.

153
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,983
Give me back my Iron Man helmet.

154
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,456
Give back my parking space.

155
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,154
You don't need a parking space.
You don't have a car.

156
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,425
You don't need an Iron Man helmet.
You're not Iron Man.

157
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,297
Well, we appear
to have reached an impasse...

158
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,498
...and, you know, I have to say,
I thought you'd be more upset...

159
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,768
...that your laptop is sitting on my junk.

160
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,244
I didn't pick up on that.
That's a nice touch.

161
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,194
This is so exciting. I'm feeling all tingly.

162
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,299
Although, that could just be
my newly defoliated bikini zone.

163
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,530
Keep a lookout.

164
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,330
This place is swarming
with campus security.

165
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,008
They will not hesitate to scold us.

166
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,007
Freaking pigs.

167
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,008
Oh, yeah.

168
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,456
Okay, now pull your car into the spot
and let's get out of here.

169
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,284
Wait, I'm leaving my car here?

170
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,824
Yes. And be sure
and put on the emergency brake.

171
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,462
It really makes these things tough
to budge.

172
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,155
Before I park, come in the backseat.

173
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,063
I wanna show you something
I had done today.

174
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,500
All right. Color me intrigued.

175
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,309
What do you think?

176
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:49,208
I think you're high on paint fumes.

177
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,950
And, boy, that's a lot of Band-Aids.

178
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:58,719
Okay, Howard's mother is in, like,
every one of your wedding photos.

179
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,949
What can I tell you? She's a big girl.

180
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,964
Wherever you look, there she is.

181
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:09,996
More coffee?

182
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,363
No, Leonard's taking me
to a physics lecture...

183
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,267
...and coffee will just keep me awake.

184
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,200
Oh, I'll get it.

185
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:25,411
Oh, looks like someone's
on Team Bernadette.

186
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,351
- Where's Howard?
- He's not here. What's wrong?

187
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,752
He had my car towed.
It cost me $200 to get it back.

188
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,289
Oh, no.

189
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,586
Where was it parked?

190
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,221
In Sheldon's spot.

191
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,402
Well, that doesn't make sense.
Sheldon doesn't have a spot.

192
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:46,503
Was it maybe in Howard's spot?

193
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,499
Don't play dumb with me, sister.
You tell your husband he owes me $200.

194
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,373
- Well, that doesn't make sense either.
- Why not?

195
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,310
Because I'm the one who had it towed.

196
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,522
- You?
- Didn't see that one coming, did you?

197
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,750
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're not gonna see this coming.

198
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,624
- Aah!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God, are you okay?

199
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,488
- What the hell do you have in there?
- My wallet, keys...

200
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,898
...and a coffee can full of change
I've been meaning to take to the bank.

201
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,429
- Don't move. I'll get some ice.
- Are you okay?

202
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,770
Get away from me, or I swear to God,
I will rip out what's left of your pubes.

203
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,139
- Here.
- Oh, thanks. Aah.

204
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,542
Amy, you think maybe
this has gotten out of hand?

205
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,615
Gee, you think?

206
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,782
I do. Penny, Bernadette and I are sorry.

207
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,617
- You hit her. What did I do?
- You had my car towed.

208
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,760
- You were parked in Howard's spot.
- I was in Sheldon's spot.

209
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,327
Sheldon doesn't have a spot.

210
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,963
Guys, I think I need to go
to the emergency room.

211
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,157
- Okay, let's go.
- I'll drive. You can see...

212
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:53,361
...where the tow truck scratched my car.
- The tow truck didn't scratch your car.

213
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,131
- How do you know?
- Because I did it.

214
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,645
Morning, Professor Stevens.

215
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:11,482
Hey, don't look at that whiteboard.
That's my math, not your math.

216
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:12,850
Keep walking, nosy.

217
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:17,027
What the hell are you doing?

218
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:23,157
Oh. You said I'm not using my space,
so I'm using it.

219
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,862
Okay, you need to move now.

220
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,540
No, I don't.

221
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,676
You can't stay there forever.

222
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:37,372
Actually, I have a plastic baggy
strapped to my leg that says I can.

223
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,311
Give up, Wolowitz.

224
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,046
You've chosen to tangle
with a superior intellect you can't defeat.

225
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,917
There is nothing
you could possibly do to...

226
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,163
Those aren't gonna help you, Sheldon.

227
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:00,338
Oh, yes, they are. I mean, what?

228
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,002
I'm warning you, Sheldon.

229
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,676
Your threats are empty.

230
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,367
Nothing can move me.

231
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,648
- Stop that!
- Get out of my spot!

232
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,875
No. That's it.
I am calling campus security.

233
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,550
You prepare for the scolding of your life.

234
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,279
What are you idiots doing?

235
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,448
He's trying to kill me, Leonard.

236
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,856
Video games and rock music
have desensitized him to violence.

237
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:29,265
Would you please talk some sense
into your lunatic roommate?

238
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,437
You're both acting like lunatics.
It's just a parking spot.

239
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,797
Not just a parking spot.

240
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,940
He can't handle the fact
that I'm a bigger deal than he is now.

241
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:40,373
Oh, preposterous.
I have been solely responsible...

242
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,571
...for this university's
six-Ioop quantum gravity calculations.

243
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,808
I have changed the way we think
about Bose-Einstein condensates...

244
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,384
...and I am also the one
who got Nutter Butters...

245
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,283
...in the cafeteria vending machine.

246
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:57,128
Maybe you missed that news while you were
floating around like a goof in outer space.

247
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,597
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

248
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,500
Can you believe this guy?

249
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,000
What I don't believe
is you tried to run him over.

250
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,297
Oh, like you've never thought
of doing that.

251
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:13,100
Don't hate me
just because I lived the dream.

252
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,639
Hey, sweet ride.

253
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,651
What are you doing in there?

254
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,914
Just breaking in your new car.

255
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,155
Stop that! You stop that!

256
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,487
You know what they say.

257
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:34,495
Revenge is a dish best served nude.

258
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,038
- Hey, got a minute?
- Oh, of course, come in.

259
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,608
This is an authentic Chinese throwing star,
and I must warn you...

260
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,514
...I have seen many people throw them
in movies.

261
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,056
Calm down. Howard has something
he wants to say to you.

262
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:00,682
All right.

263
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:07,456
Sheldon, when this whole thing
with the parking space started...

264
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,796
...I had no idea
just how much of a crazy bastard...

265
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,269
Howard, that's not how we practiced it.

266
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:19,636
I had no idea
how much that spot meant to you.

267
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,405
Anyway, I called President Seibert...

268
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,516
...and told him
it's not worth fighting over the spot...

269
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,414
...so you keep it...

270
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,680
...and I'll park in the structure
across the street.

271
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,926
Well, Howard, thank you.

272
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,092
That's quite a gesture on your part.

273
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,832
You've shown yourself
to be the bigger man.

274
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,060
- Thank you.
- Which I find totally unacceptable.

275
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,405
I must be the bigger man.

276
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:52,001
Therefore, you may use my spot...

277
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:57,012
...until such time as I learn to drive
or get a Batmobile.

278
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,544
Wow, okay. Well, thanks.

279
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,915
I don't know what to say.

280
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,217
There is nothing to say.
Except I'm the bigger man.

281
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,724
I'm not kidding. Say it.

282
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,256
Just say it.

283
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,868
You're the bigger man, Sheldon.

284
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,730
Oh, stop.

285
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,035
And I believe this is yours.

286
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:27,409
FYI, if you wear that into a bank,
they will tackle you to the ground.

287
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,244
I'd like to propose a toast.

288
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,421
To burying the hatchet.

289
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,853
To burying the hatchet.

290
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,118
You know,
I'm kind of glad this happened.

291
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:47,093
Me too. In a weird way,
I kind of feel like it brought us closer.

292
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,662
Yeah, everybody's happy. Great.

293
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,436
Can I help you?

294
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:05,413
Yes, according to information I gleaned
from Yelp...

295
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:09,781
...you had great success
when a SantariaSuzy37...

296
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:13,082
...brought you a pair of leather slacks
stained with chicken blood.

297
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:17,388
You know, I believe
I may have a similar problem.

298
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:24,597
This cushion experienced
a nude revenge wiggle.

299
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,631
A what?

300
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,971
A naked man sat on it.

301
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,837
Now, here's my concern.

302
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,605
His diet is rich in fatty deli meats.

303
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,975
What tests do you have
to detect lipid residue?

304
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,483
Lipid what?

305
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,956
Lipid residue.

306
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,819
An anal autograph.

307
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,990
A colon calling card, if you will.

308
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,666
- Tuesday okay?
- Oh.

309
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:02,205
Don't rush it. We may be dealing
with befoulment on a molecular level.

310
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,966
Let me write you a ticket.

311
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,839
Is that your son?

312
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,811
Uh-huh.

313
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,884
Looks like that laptop's seen better days.

314
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,816
If you're interested, I'm selling this.

315
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,455
It's only 2 years old...

316
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,215
...has 16 gigabytes of RAM...

317
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,256
...Intel Core i7 processor...

318
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,155
...and I can personally guarantee...

319
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:28,527
...it has spent less than 20 minutes
resting on an astronaut's penis.
