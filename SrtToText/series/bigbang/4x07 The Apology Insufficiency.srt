No, seriously, I think I've finally figured out
my problem with women.

2

The capybara is the largest member
of the rodent family.

3

What does that have to do
with me and women?

4
00:00:13,216 --> 00:00:15,047
Nothing, it was a desperate attempt...

...to introduce
an alternate topic of conversation.

6
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:20,618
My problem
is I don't project confidence.

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,282
So I decided that the next time I meet
a woman I think is attractive...

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,792
...rather than holding back
and being cautious...

...I'll assume
the mantle of self-assurance.

...he was on the verge of giving away

I can't taste the cherries.

310
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:32,947
All right, Sheldon,
what's on your mind?

311
00:17:33,755 --> 00:17:36,781
I wronged Howard
and he won't accept my apology.

312
00:17:36,992 --> 00:17:38,050
Oh, right, that.

313
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:40,194
Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey.

314
00:17:40,762 --> 00:17:43,128
Penny,
you face failure on a daily basis.

315
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:48,402
- How do you cope?
- I drink.

316
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:52,000
To drinking.

317
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,600
Nope.

318
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:03,516
If only there were some way to
force Howard to accept my apology...

319
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:06,347
...so I could escape
this miasma of guilt.

320
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:09,921
Sometimes just stuff happens
and there's nothing you can do about it.

321
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:13,255
For example, Lisa Peterson hasn't talked
to me since 11th grade.

322
00:18:13,428 --> 00:18:15,293
No matter how much you apologize...

323
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:18,297
...you can't go back
and undry-hump someone's boyfriend.

324
00:18:19,434 --> 00:18:20,594
I see.

325
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:23,704
You're saying I'm facing
Starfleet Academy's...

326
00:18:23,872 --> 00:18:27,239
...unwinnable command scenario:
The Kobayashi Maru.

327
00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:29,637
Exactly. Sometimes you can't win.

328
00:18:29,845 --> 00:18:31,972
Captain Kirk won.

329
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:35,340
Kirk cheated.

330
00:18:36,518 --> 00:18:38,452
Impressive that you know that.

331
00:18:39,955 --> 00:18:43,356
Hard to believe I'm actually having
this conversation with you.

332
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:45,550
Right there with you.

333
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:51,663
Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru
by reprogramming the simulator.

334
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:53,498
- That's it.
- What?

335
00:18:53,702 --> 00:18:55,363
I'll reprogram Howard.

336
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:58,836
Wait...
Sheldon, you can't reprogram people.

337
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,634
No, you can't reprogram people.

338
00:19:02,911 --> 00:19:05,971
To James Tiberius Kirk.

339
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:17,758
- Hello, all.
LEONARD: Hello.

340
00:19:17,926 --> 00:19:22,090
Howard, you're feeling better
about me today, aren't you?

341
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,663
- Not really.
- Yes, you are.

342
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:30,362
I'm using neuro-linguistic programming
to modify your thought patterns.

343
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:34,175
Go away, Sheldon.

344
00:19:34,743 --> 00:19:37,405
There's a 9.95 eBook
down the drain.

345
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:39,913
- What's in the bag?
- It's for Howard.

346
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:42,914
No, Sheldon,
you can't fix this with gifts.

347
00:19:43,118 --> 00:19:46,383
Nevertheless, I've hurt you
and whether you forgive me or not...

348
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:48,556
...I want you to have this.

349
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,718
You're giving me a couch cushion?

350
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:55,089
No. The cushion is merely symbolic.

351
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,959
I'm giving you my spot on the couch.

352
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:02,036
But you love that spot.

353
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:04,467
No, I love my mother.

354
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:08,439
My feelings for my spot
are much greater.

355
00:20:09,277 --> 00:20:14,442
It is the singular location in space around
which revolves my entire universe.

356
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,117
And now it's yours.

357
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:21,645
Oh, my God, dude,
now you have to forgive him.

358
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:25,889
All right. Uh, apology accepted.

359
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:28,059
High five.

360
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,095
Not too hard.

361
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:32,900
Thank you.

362
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:36,366
I haven't cried like this
since Toy Story 3.

363
00:20:46,348 --> 00:20:49,476
I gotta tell you, Sheldon,
I understand why you chose this spot.

364
00:20:49,651 --> 00:20:52,484
I mean, the temperature's good,
but there's no draft.

365
00:20:52,654 --> 00:20:55,145
I can see the television,
but I can still talk to...

366
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:57,348
I changed my mind.
Get out of my spot.

367
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:02,722
- How long?
- Ninety-four seconds.

368
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:34,852
