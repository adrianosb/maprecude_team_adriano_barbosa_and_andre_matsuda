1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:07,204
Howard's capsule should be
reentering the atmosphere any minute.

2
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:11,434
- It'll be good to have him back.
- The Fantastic Four, reunited, ha, ha.

3
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:15,338
You had a good run, fake Wolowitz.

4
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,813
We'll remember you
with nostalgic fondness...

5
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,146
...the way we do the dial-up modem...

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:25,586
...the VHS tape,
or Leonard's gym membership.

7
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:28,655
We're not kicking him out.

8
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:32,764
- Stuart and I have become good friends.
- Okay, one vote for, one vote against.

9
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:36,333
- Leonard, you're the tiebreaker.
- I don't have a problem with Stuart.

10
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,495
He gives us a 20 percent discount
at his comic book store.

11
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,134
Well, I don't sell
my friendship that cheaply.

12
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,674
- I can go 30.
- Welcome aboard, old chum.

13
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,748
Okay, the NASA website says
Howard's final descent has begun.

14
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,446
He left a boy.

15
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:57,111
He returns a boy-sized hero.

16
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:02,961
Loops, calm down!

17
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,602
- What's that?
- The Jewish prayer for eating bread!

18
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:16,336
We don't have one
for falling out of space!

19
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,938
We did it.

20
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,349
We're on the ground.
We survived!

21
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:27,676
That was just the parachute.

22
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,015
We still have another six miles to go.

23
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,155
United Airlines K9...

24
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,917
Waiting for my husband.

25
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:08,421
That's nice.

26
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,996
He's coming back from outer space.

27
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,698
I think this flight is coming from Houston.

28
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,365
No, I mean...
Never mind.

29
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,733
There he is!
Howie! Howie!

30
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,571
Howie! Howie! Howie!

31
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,140
- Howie! Howie! Howie!
- Thank you. Great to be back on Earth.

32
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,082
Uh, I think they're here for me, Ringo.

33
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,722
Howie! Howie!

34
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,825
- Mr. Mandel, I'm your driver.
- Oh, thanks.

35
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,524
That nut job was telling everybody
on the plane he's an astronaut.

36
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,369
I missed you so much.

37
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,836
I missed you too.

38
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,471
Where are the guys?

39
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,770
Oh, it's just me.

40
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:04,174
Oh, I get it. They're waiting, back home,
with a big surprise party.

41
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,817
Don't worry.
I can act surprised.

42
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,956
No, I told them
they could have you tomorrow night.

43
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,150
Tonight, you belong to me.

44
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,693
- Gesundheit. You okay?
- I am now that you're back.

45
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,362
Come on, let's go home,
so I can tear off those little pants.

46
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:31,738
Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose
a lot of muscle tone in space...

47
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:35,039
...so you might have to do
most of the heavy lifting.

48
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,950
Now, I am very disappointed
that I won't be able to celebrate...

49
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,645
...Howard's accomplishment tonight.
- Me too, but we'll see him tomorrow.

50
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,586
Yes, it's just that
in all the years I've known him...

51
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:50,525
...he's never had the opportunity
to receive my admiration.

52
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:55,765
I was excited to see the look
on his face when it finally happened.

53
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,127
You're unbelievable.

54
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,032
I know.

55
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,966
All right, Pictionary.
What are the teams?

56
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,439
- How about boys versus girls?
- Oh.

57
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,111
That hardly seems fair.

58
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,942
But I guess any team that I'm not on
has a decided disadvantage.

59
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:15,481
- Once again, unbelievable.
- Yeah. Once again, I know.

60
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:19,921
All right, round one. Here.

61
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,855
- Got it.
- Okay.

62
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,355
Ready, set, go!

63
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,333
A box?

64
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,430
Uh... Window?

65
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,499
Batman.

66
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,331
Batman and Robin.

67
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,770
Uh, Wonder Twins, plus the monkey.

68
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,576
Wonder Twins,
plus the monkey and Batman.

69
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,445
- Gift? Present!
- Present! Yeah!

70
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,487
Leonard.
Now, how can you not get that?

71
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,592
In what universe is that a present?

72
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,299
It's not a present.
It's the present.

73
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:06,029
Look, there's you and me.
It's Penny and Amy.

74
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:10,642
We're playing Pictionary, in the present.

75
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,805
Oh, my God, we're gonna kill them.

76
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:23,412
- It's a quark-gluon plasma.
- No.

77
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:28,019
It's asymptotically free partons
inside a quark-gluon plasma.

78
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,487
Nothing with quarks.

79
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,831
It's an observational rebuttal
of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.

80
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,237
- No.
- It's a chocolate chip cookie!

81
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,905
Yes!

82
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,272
- How could you miss that?
- Hey!

83
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,936
If you want someone to guess
chocolate chip cookie...

84
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,172
...you draw a glass of milk next to it.

85
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,682
- Penny got it.
- Yeah, only after I eliminated...

86
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,844
...all the obvious answers.

87
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,380
You're welcome.

88
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,758
Oh, uh...

89
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:02,952
Sausage.

90
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,721
Uh... Bratwurst?

91
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,224
Oh, hot dog.

92
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:13,601
- Penny, aren't you gonna draw something?
- Relax, we've got time. This is so fun.

93
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,542
There.

94
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,667
A solar system.

95
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,211
Uh, uh, uh...

96
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,043
Unidentified flying liverwurst?

97
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,482
Now?

98
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,211
Soon.

99
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:34,555
Come on, Leonard.
I am spoon-feeding this to you.

100
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,728
I don't know.

101
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,499
Casper, the alcoholic ghost?

102
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,533
All right, that's enough. Ahem.

103
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,277
Uh, hand?

104
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,415
- Nail? Polish?
- Yeah!

105
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,607
No, no, no!

106
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,581
No!

107
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,847
The word is Polish.
See? Look.

108
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,820
Polish sausage!

109
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,086
Model of the solar system,
developed by Nicolaus Copernicus...

110
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,494
...a Polish astronomer. Finally, if that
wasn't enough, which it should've been...

111
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,999
...this is Madame Curie killing herself
by discovering radium.

112
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:22,540
Who, although she was a naturalized
French citizen, was Polish by birth!

113
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,042
Excuse me, the word is polish.

114
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,942
See? Small P.

115
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,618
Ah.

116
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:39,051
So it is.
I guess we both share blame on this one.

117
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,625
Bernie, you okay?

118
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,560
Yeah, I'll be right there.

119
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:56,197
Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?

120
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,644
It's allergies.

121
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,711
Okay, ha.

122
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,714
I took some Benadryl, I'll be fine.

123
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,851
So did you miss me?

124
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,720
Are you kidding?
Every minute of every...

125
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,962
Oh. Ew.

126
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,494
Excuse me.

127
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,172
Sweetie, we don't have to do this now.

128
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,734
Yes, we do.

129
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,010
- You left right after we got married.
- Ha, ha.

130
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,546
This is like our honeymoon.

131
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:47,958
- Now, hold on to your hat.
- Oh.

132
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,462
Uh-oh.

133
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,963
- You okay?
- A little dizzy.

134
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,430
Must be the Benadryl.

135
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,226
Switch places with me.

136
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,031
Okay, ha.

137
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,369
Now...

138
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,779
...kiss me.

139
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,084
Bernadette?

140
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,827
Bernie?

141
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,591
- Bernie?
- Aah!

142
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,992
That was amazing.

143
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:38,810
You made me feel things I nev...

144
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,984
Well, that was quick and a little gross.

145
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,419
Now I know how she feels.

146
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,819
Hey, Sheldon,
you're always full of fun little facts.

147
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:01,194
Where did the expression
"got your ass handed to you" come from?

148
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,798
Don't know.

149
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,836
I wonder if it's from, like, ancient Rome...

150
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:14,138
...where they'd actually chop
somebody's ass off and then go, "Here."

151
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:19,342
You know, to appease Loseroneous,
the god of losers.

152
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,051
I am not a loser.

153
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:26,455
Pictionary is not a true test
of any real intelligence or skill.

154
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,821
In all fairness,
Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills.

155
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,361
A pretty well-rounded game.

156
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:36,023
Lot of big talk from a man
who can't draw a chocolate chip cookie.

157
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,964
Fine, pick another game.
Amy and I will beat you at anything.

158
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:43,039
All right. Let's play...

159
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,473
...Physics Fiesta.

160
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:50,174
- Oh, come on. What is that?
- It's a game that I just invented...

161
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:54,615
...in which the participants answer
physics questions in remedial Spanish.

162
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,311
Uh...

163
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,549
Donde esta el boson de Higgs?

164
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,922
En el acelerador de particulas.

165
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,593
Bueno, mi amigo.

166
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,595
No, no. We're not playing
some dumb, made-up game.

167
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,532
All games are made up.

168
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:17,198
They're not found in nature.
You don't just dig in the ground...

169
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,038
...come across a rich vein
of Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots.

170
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,909
- Pick another game.
- Why don't we do something athletic?

171
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,950
Like, go over to the university pool
and play water polo?

172
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,587
No good, Sheldon doesn't float.

173
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,689
That is true.
I have a higher than normal body density.

174
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,623
If I run too deep a bath, I drown.

175
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,088
- All right, let's keep it simple. Darts?
- No, that's not fair, either.

176
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,791
- Why not?
- Darts is a bar game.

177
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,938
You've been frequenting drinking
establishments since you were of legal age.

178
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,304
Yeah, that's when it started.

179
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:56,442
Well, regardless, she has a distinct
advantage in all tavern-based competitions.

180
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,743
Pool, beer-pong, wet T-shirt contests.
They're all out.

181
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:04,912
Okay, just for the record,
I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest.

182
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:08,423
I've won a few, but that's just
because I spill when I'm drunk.

183
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:14,790
We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA
and play real-life Operation.

184
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:17,559
- No.
- Uh-uh.

185
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,761
I don't think so.

186
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,768
You sure?
The nose doesn't light up...

187
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,569
...but if the corpse is fresh enough
sometimes you can get the leg to jerk.

188
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:32,642
Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle,
your little star is home!

189
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,686
Ma, the chain's on the door!

190
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:41,520
Howard? I thought
I wasn't going to see you till tomorrow!

191
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:45,630
Yeah, well, Bernie's not feeling well,
so I thought I'd stop by.

192
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:48,358
Tell you about
the greatest adventure of my life.

193
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,092
See if you can make me feel bad about it.

194
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:56,464
Okay! Hold on, I'm not decent!

195
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,303
All right.

196
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:02,511
The woman hasn't tied her robe in 20 years.
Suddenly she's not decent?

197
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:06,082
You want me to hide in the closet
or go out the back?

198
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,319
Shh! You need to whisper.

199
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,081
Ma, who's in there?

200
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,318
Uh, nobody! The TV is on!

201
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:19,362
I only got one sock.
Where's my other sock?

202
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,032
- Who is that?
- I told you, it's the TV!

203
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:25,796
Jay Leno lost a sock. It's hilarious.

204
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,197
If you're busy, I can come back.

205
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,740
Just give me a second!

206
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,901
Go, go, go!

207
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,853
- Dr. Schneider?
- Oh.

208
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,022
Hello, Howard.

209
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,691
What are you doing here?

210
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,989
Um... House call.

211
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:54,997
You're a dentist.

212
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,730
Yes. Yes, I am.

213
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,139
I think he's onto us!

214
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,136
Okay. Glasses off.

215
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,773
Find Waldo.

216
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,748
Hurry up, find him. Find him.

217
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,688
- I'm trying! Don't yell at me!
- For goodness' sake.

218
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,385
He's wearing a hat,
glasses and a red-striped shirt!

219
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:27,054
- I know what he looks like!
- There he is, I got him!

220
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,757
Yes! We win again. Yes.

221
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,596
How could you not find him?

222
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,238
Because he's hard to find!

223
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:38,069
If he was easy to find,
the books would be called There's Waldo!

224
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,475
Fifty-seven, 58, 59.

225
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,547
That's one minute.

226
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,450
Long division, long division. Go, go, go.

227
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,558
Remember, show your work.

228
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,587
I'm okay. I'm okay.

229
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,125
I'm not okay.

230
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,431
Get up. We can't...
We can't lose in math!

231
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,799
- Thirty-seven!
- Yes!

232
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,840
Ready, set, wrestle.

233
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,810
One, two, three, pin.

234
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,038
Mwah.

235
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,182
- Stop that.
- Mwah.

236
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,048
- Amy, do something.
- Mwah.

237
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,416
Amy. Help.

238
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,922
Wha...? Amy, stop that.

239
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,287
Amy, Penny.
Both of you, stop it.

240
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,024
One to beam aboard?

241
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,030
Oh, my God, you're back.

242
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,171
Oh, look at you.
You... You look like you grew.

243
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,365
Yeah.

244
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:48,680
The lack of gravity did decompress my
spine, so I'm, like, an inch-and-a-half taller.

245
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:53,975
I'm going to the DMVtomorrow to get
my license changed before I shrink back.

246
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:58,486
Come in, come in. I didn't think I was
gonna get to see you until tomorrow.

247
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:02,787
Yeah, well, Bernadette's a little
under the weather and my mom's...

248
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,328
...kind of under my dentist.

249
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,198
Wait, your...
Your mother's sleeping with your dentist?

250
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:13,360
Former dentist. I need a new one
now that I know where his hands have been.

251
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,400
So you're wandering
all around by yourself?

252
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,704
That's not the hero's welcome
an astronaut should come home to.

253
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:27,011
It's okay. You know, we space cowboys
don't do what we do for glory and fame.

254
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:30,644
We leave that to your rock stars,
and your athletes...

255
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,223
...and your Howie Mandels.

256
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,592
Oh, hey, man, welcome back.

257
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,789
Oh, Stuart, thanks.
What are you doing here?

258
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,437
- I kind of live here now.
- Just until he gets back on his feet.

259
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:49,438
Which are looking pretty good
in the boots I bought him for his birthday.

260
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,542
Ah, he's spoiling me and I love it.

261
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:01,013
Wow, ha, so you guys are, like, buds now?

262
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,881
Oh, yeah. We hang out all the time.

263
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,717
He doesn't have a girlfriend,
I don't have a girlfriend.

264
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:10,123
It's like we both had these holes in our lives,
but now we fill each other's holes.

265
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:21,028
That sounds a little funny
to an American ear.

266
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,641
- Which part?
- Just all of it.

267
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,377
Okay, so, what...?
What do you guys got going on, tonight?

268
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,641
Raj is taking me
to the Sound of Music sing-along.

269
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,943
Sound of Music sing-along?
That used to be our thing, but that's cool.

270
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:41,355
Howard, it's still our thing. Come with us.
We'll get you a scalped ticket.

271
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,154
So I'd be sitting by myself?

272
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,259
We'll switch.
You'll come sit with me after intermission.

273
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,765
So I'd be sitting by myself
during "Edelweiss"?

274
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,667
No, no, you guys go.

275
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,305
Have fun.

276
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:58,806
- Okay. Will I get to see you tomorrow?
- Absolutely. See you, Stuart.

277
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,569
Yeah, yeah.

278
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,072
Is he taller?

279
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,153
At least my mother made her boyfriend
climb out the window.

280
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:16,825
All right, standard state fair
pie-eating contest rules are...

281
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:20,453
...no hands,
first one to clean the pan wins.

282
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,758
On the count of three.

283
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,425
One...

284
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,500
...two...
- Wait.

285
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,207
I'm a little concerned.

286
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,141
Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.

287
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,007
- So?
- So with all those antioxidants...

288
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,978
...what if I run out of oxidants?

289
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,421
Sheldon, we haven't won a game all night.

290
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:49,687
You either stick your face in that pie,
or I'm gonna stick that pie in your face.

291
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,492
That's rude.

292
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:59,364
One, two, three, eat.

293
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,941
Hey, guys,
guess who's back from space.

294
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,209
Not now!

295
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,390
Oh, ow! Blueberry in my nose!
Blueberry in my nose!

296
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,956
Snort it down and keep eating!

297
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,337
You look familiar.

298
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,109
I don't think so.

299
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,706
Yeah.

300
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,279
I just saw you on the news.

301
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,478
You're an astronaut.

302
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,879
Yes. Yes, I am.

303
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:52,489
Good for you. How about a piece
of cheesecake on the house?

304
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,592
Oh, thank you so much.
I've been having the worst night.

305
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:59,094
I just got back and my friends don't care,
my wife's sick.

306
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,789
- Went to my mom's...
- You want the cheesecake or not?

307
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,361
Yes, please.

308
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,569
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time

309
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:15,975
Till touchdown brings me round again to find

310
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:20,312
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, oh, no

311
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,919
I'm a rocket man

312
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,884
Perfect.
