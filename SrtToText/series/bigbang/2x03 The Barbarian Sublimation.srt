Apparently, she's a big old five.

308
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,918
- Sheldon, what do you want?
- Oh, good, you got my note.

309
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,119
Penny, I'd like you to meet Tom.
Uh, Penny, this is Tom.

310
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:43,730
- Tom, may I present Penny.
- Hi, Penny.

311
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:48,165
Hi, as long as I'm here, I'm on a quest with
newbs, don't know what they're doing.

312
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:50,601
Got one assassin, three spell casters,
no tank.

313
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,603
- Can we talk later?
- No, I need you now.

314
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,799
Wouldn't you prefer
to socialize with Tom...

315
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:57,810
...who is a sexually passive
outdoorsman?

316
00:19:59,982 --> 00:20:03,611
- Whatever, I'll figure it out myself.
- Bye, Penny.

317
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,753
I'm sorry, dude,
she didn't look anything like her picture.

318
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:12,586
They never do.

319
00:20:19,368 --> 00:20:20,858
HOWARD:
<i>Hello, fair Penny.</i>

320
00:20:21,036 --> 00:20:24,437
PENNY: <i>Who are you?</i>
HOWARD: <i>It is I, Sir Howard of Wolowitz.</i>

321
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:28,742
<i>Can I interest you</i>
<i>in an afternoon of spirited questing...</i>

322
00:20:28,911 --> 00:20:31,471
<i>...followed by a flagon of ale</i>
<i>at yon virtual tavern?</i>

323
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:33,612
PENNY:
<i>Yeah, sure, why not?</i>

324
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:39,244
Oh, my God, I need help.

325
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:11,542
