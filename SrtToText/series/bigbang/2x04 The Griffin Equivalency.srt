1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:03,451
Let's see, Raj was the <i>kung pao</i> chicken.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,487
- I'm the dumplings.
- Yes, you are.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,355
Creepy, Howard.

4
00:00:09,526 --> 00:00:11,016
Creepy good or creepy bad?

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,125
- Who was the shrimp with lobster sauce?
- That would be me.

6
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:18,825
Come to papa, you un-kosher delight.

7
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:22,036
I'm not necessarily talking to the food.

8
00:00:27,544 --> 00:00:29,171
Sit over there.

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,679
Sit over there.

10
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:47,359
- Baby wipe?
- Why do you have--?

11
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,395
- No, don't ask.
- No, don't, don't.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,624
I'll tell you why.

13
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:55,560
I had to sanitize my hands
because the university...

14
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,867
...replaced the paper towels
in the restrooms with hot-air blowers.

15
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:01,067
I thought the blowers were more sanitary.

16
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:02,643
- Why?
- Really, don't.

17
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:07,381
Hot-air blowers are incubators
and spewers of bacteria and pestilence.

18
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,348
It'd be more hygienic
if they had a plague-infested gibbon...

19
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,750
...sneeze my hands dry.

20
00:01:12,922 --> 00:01:16,187
Hey, guys,
I just got the most amazing new--

21
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,324
Do you think you'll ever be able to talk
in front of me without being drunk?

22
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,160
Okay, well, I'll just go eat by myself.

23
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,238
- You don't have to do that.
- It's okay.

24
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:33,603
Between him not talking,
him talking, and him...

25
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,642
...l'm better off alone.

26
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:40,214
So goodbye, you poor, strange little man.

27
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:47,821
- She's so considerate.
- So, what's your news?

28
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:50,789
Remember that little object
I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,019
Oh, yeah, 2008-NQ sub-17.

30
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:56,131
Or as I call it, Planet Bollywood.

31
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:58,158
Anyway, because of my discovery...

32
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:01,770
<i>...People Magazine</i> is naming me
one of their 30 Under 30 to Watch.

33
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:04,907
- Raj, that's incredible.
- Congratulations.

34
00:02:05,074 --> 00:02:10,410
Excuse me, 30 what under 30 what
to watch what?

35
00:02:10,814 --> 00:02:13,248
Thirty visionaries
under 30 years of age to watch...

36
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,613
...as they challenge
the preconceptions of the fields.

37
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:19,778
If I had a million guesses,
I never would have gotten that.

38
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,257
They've got me in with a guy doing
something about hunger in Indonesia...

39
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:27,487
...a psychotherapist using dolphins
to rehabilitate prisoners...

40
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:32,294
...and Ellen Page,
star of the charming independent film <i>Juno.</i>

41
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,533
Oh, I'd so do her.

42
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:39,407
You'd do the dolphins.

43
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,134
Do I get a mention...

44
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:44,178
...for designing the telescope camera
mounting bracket?

45
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:47,407
Sorry, it's not part of my heartwarming
and personal narrative...

46
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,745
...in which a humble boy
from New Delhi...

47
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,322
...overcame poverty and prejudice and
journeyed to America to reach for the stars.

48
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,085
Poverty? Your father's a gynecologist.
He drives a Bentley.

49
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:00,427
It's a lease.

50
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,536
I'm confused. Was there
some sort of peer-review committee...

51
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:10,036
...to determine which scientists
would be included?

52
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:13,937
Peer review? It's <i>People Magazine.</i>
People picked me.

53
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:17,175
- What people?
- The people from <i>People.</i>

54
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:19,781
What? Yeah, but exactly
who are these people?

55
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,611
What are their credentials?
How are they qualified?

56
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,185
What makes accidentally noticing
a hunk of rock...

57
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:28,256
...traipsing around the solar system
for billions of years...

58
00:03:28,424 --> 00:03:33,157
...more noteworthy than any other scientific
accomplishment by someone under 30?

59
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,066
Boy, I'll bet Ellen Page's friends
aren't giving her this kind of crap.

60
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:43,631
You proud of yourself?

61
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,968
In general, yes.

62
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,102
Oh, there's my missing neutrino.

63
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:20,742
You were hiding from me
as an unbalanced charge...

64
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,743
...weren't you,
you little subatomic dickens?

65
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,514
- Hi, Sheldon.
- Hey, look, I found my missing neutrino.

66
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,278
Oh, good,
we can take it off the milk carton.

67
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,353
We're gonna apologize
and invite Raj out to dinner.

68
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,355
Apologize? For what?

69
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:40,724
He came over last night with some pretty
good news and we weren't very supportive.

70
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:44,298
I sense you're trying
to tell me something.

71
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,995
You were a colossal asshat.

72
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,735
Oh, no, I beg to differ.

73
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:54,376
Of the three of us,
I was by far the most supportive.

74
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,205
Really? Do tell.

75
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:00,042
How will Raj ever reach true greatness
if his friends lower the bar for him?

76
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:04,681
When I was 11, my sister bought our father
a "world's greatest dad" coffee mug.

77
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:08,017
And frankly, the man coasted
until the day he died.

78
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:10,992
Okay, let's try it this way.

79
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,425
What if this <i>People Magazine</i> thing
is the best Raj is going to achieve?

80
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:19,134
- I had not considered that.
- Mm-hm. Come on.

81
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:22,265
I often forget
other people have limitations.

82
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:24,463
It's so sad.

83
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:27,568
- He can feel sadness?
- Not really.

84
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,769
It's what you and I call condescension.

85
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,675
Now, when we go in there,
let's show Raj that we're happy for him.

86
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,580
But I'm not.

87
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:40,046
Well, then fake it.
Look at me.

88
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,818
I could be grinding on the fact that
without my stabilizing telescope mount...

89
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:48,089
...he never would have found
that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz.

90
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,763
But I'm bigger than that.

91
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:53,930
Fine. What do you want me to do?

92
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:55,799
Smile.

93
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:07,041
Oh, crap, that's terrifying.

94
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,117
We're here to see Koothrappali,
not kill Batman.

95
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,386
Try less teeth.

96
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:22,527
Close enough. Come on.

97
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,661
- Hey, Raj.
- Hey, guys. What's up?

98
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:28,963
We wanted to invite you
out to dinner tonight.

99
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:33,234
Celebrate your 30 Under 30 thing.
Right, Sheldon?

100
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,509
- It's very nice of you. I would like that.
- Hello, boys.

101
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:41,343
- Dr. Gablehauser.
- Dr. Koothrappali.

102
00:06:41,517 --> 00:06:43,041
- Dr. Gablehauser.
- Dr. Hofstadter.

103
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:44,550
- Dr. Gablehauser.
- Dr. Cooper.

104

- Dr. Gablehauser.
- Mr. Wolowitz.

105
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:52,856
Boys, I've got a question for you.
Who in this room discovered a star?

106
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:55,896
Actually, 2008-NQ sub-17
is a planetary body.

107
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:58,260
I'm not talking about you,
I'm talking about me.

108
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:03,098
You, my exotic young friend, are my star.

109
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:06,139
But you didn't discover him.
You merely noticed he was here...

110
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:08,971
...much like he did with 2008-NQ sub-17.

111
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:11,909
- Sheldon.
- Ugh. Sorry.

112
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,848
Well, we gotta get you into a better office.
Something more suited to your status.

113
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,252
- You don't have to go to trouble.
- How about von Gerlach's old office?

114
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:25,519
- I'd rather have Fishbein's. It's bigger.
GABLEHAUSER: Done.

115
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,686
Wait, I called dibs on Fishbein's office...

116
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,265
...the day he started showing up at work
in his bathrobe.

117
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:34,426
He gets a new office, I can't get
paper towels in the mens' room?

118
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:37,334
- Sheldon.
- Damn, this is hard.

Well, taller than you.

- Who doesn't?

00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:14,674
Dr. Koothrappali, have you ever had lunch
in the president's dining room?

128
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:17,369
I didn't even know
there was a president's dining room.

129
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:20,107
It's the same food as the cafeteria,
only fresh.

- Have any of you been to a photo shoot?
HOWARD: No.

It's fantastic.

Apparently, the camera loves me,
and I, it.

138

They're going to digitally add
a supernova.

140

They say it's the perfect metaphor
for my incandescent talent.

141

- You just got him this afternoon.

Yes, but I'm finding

- A lackey?
- I'm sorry, is that politically incorrect?

Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.

- Oh, you're welcome.

Of course, I couldn't get you

and you guys are just, you know, P's.

162

There's a tribe in Papua New Guinea...

163
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:12,549
...where when a hunter flaunts his success
to the rest of the village...

164
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:16,858
...they kill him and drive away evil spirits
with a drum made of his skin.

one of the Spears sisters.

to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame...

I am not your squeeze.
There is no squeezing.

00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:42,770
<i>I can't see her. Center her in the frame.</i>

303
00:18:42,938 --> 00:18:45,202
Here you go. Cute, huh?

304
00:18:45,941 --> 00:18:47,875
<i>She's not Indian.</i>

305
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,511
<i>So she's not Indian.</i>
<i>The boy's sowing some wild oats.</i>

306
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,080
No, no, no, there's no sowing,
no squeezing and no sucking face.

<i>What if he gets her pregnant?</i>

<i>Is this hotsy-totsy who you want</i>
<i>as the mother of your grandchildren?</i>

309
00:19:00,989 --> 00:19:03,617
What right do you have
to pick whom I have children with?

310
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:06,056
<i>Look, Rajesh,</i>
<i>I understand you're in America.</i>

311
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,594
<i>You want to try the "local cuisine."

312

<i>But trust me,</i>
<i>you don't want it for a steady diet.</i>

313
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:17,671
Now, you listen to me. I am no longer
a child and I will not be spoken to like one.

314
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,809
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go throw up.

PENNY: I don't know.

316
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,074
Maybe it's the local cuisine.

317
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:36,014
Okay, well, it's nice to meet you.

318
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:38,682
Just gonna set you on down over here.

319
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:42,597
And I'm gonna leave, so namaste.

320
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:49,034
And FYI, you'd be lucky
to have me as daughter-in-law.

321
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,036
<i>She's feisty.</i>

322
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,005
<i>I like that.</i>

Raj, what are you doing?

00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:13,824
No, no notes.
If you have something to say to me, say it.

Sorry.
