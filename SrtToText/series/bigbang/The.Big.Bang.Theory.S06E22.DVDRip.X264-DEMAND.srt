1
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:04,995
The interface is pretty simple.

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:09,039
You put your horizontal X-coordinate here,
vertical Y-coordinate here.

3
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:11,539
When you're happy with those,
press this button.

4
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:13,075
Got it.

5
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:20,912
Leonard, you'll never guess
who I just found online. Hey.

6
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:25,656
- Nice shot.
- Eh, his giant head did most of the work.

7
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:30,919
Very mature.
You're lucky I'm out of Silly String.

8
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:35,227
As I was saying, Leonard,
you'll never guess who I just found online.

9
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,733
- Professor Proton.
- You're kidding.

10
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,905
- He's still alive?
- Yes.

11
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:43,906
- Who's Professor Proton?
- He was the host of this great... Hey.

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,102
Yes. Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.

13
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:51,039
Professor Proton hosted my favorite
science show when I was a child.

14
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,741
I never missed an episode.

15
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:56,012
He demonstrated scientific principles
using everyday objects.

16
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,450
It was pretty cool.

17
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,923
Aw. It's so cute when you use
the word "cool" wrong.

18
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,453
Like when kids say "pasghetti."

19
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,433
Oh, dear Lord. Leonard, look.

20
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,125
He's still available for parties and events.

21
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,339
- We should hire him.
- Hire him to do what?

22
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,135
Whatever we want.
Hang out, do experiments...

23
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,642
...make him take 12 pictures with us
so we can make a calendar.

24
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:25,150
It would be awesome to hang out with him.
I just used "awesome" wrong, didn't I?

25
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,946
Well, I'm e-mailing him right now.

26
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,749
- Do you remember his old theme song?
- Of course I do.

27
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,223
Grab your goggles, put your lab coat on

28
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:37,591
Here he comes, Professor Proton

29
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,419
Hey, uh, I just found out I have to be
at the telescope lab all weekend.

30
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,290
Any chance you and Bernadette
could take care of my dog?

31
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:15,195
- Why don't you put her in a kennel?
- Why don't you put your mother in a home?

32
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,139
To be honest, she'd do better in the kennel.

33
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:25,473
- I'll talk to Bernie. I'm sure it's fine.
- Thank you.

34
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:28,146
It's happening. Leonard, it's happening.

35
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,441
Professor Proton is coming to our house.

36
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,776
You're kidding.

37
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,954
You mean the guy who used to host
that lame kids show?

38
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,147
And you just got yourself uninvited.

39
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,651
See, I told you I'd find a tactful way
to do that.

40
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:45,661
- How'd you get him to come to your house?
- As Professor Proton always says:

41
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:49,665
"There is no problem you can't solve
if you use your noggin."

42
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,667
- And he wrote him a check.
- Yeah, that too. Big check.

43
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,499
Uncle Howard.

44
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,644
Cinnamon's here for her sleepover party.

45
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,087
You know if you had a stroke,
she'd eat you, right?

46
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,386
And it would be my pleasure
to be her num-num.

47
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,558
Okay, so, what do I need to know
to take care of her?

48
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,091
It's very simple.

49
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,529
For breakfast, she has an egg white frittata.

50
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,227
Give her a choice of home fries
or an English muffin.

51
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,407
But not both. We're watching our weight.

52
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:34,409
Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop,
some scampi, whatever you like.

53
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,472
- Classy dog.
- Yes.

54
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,078
Also, don't forget to close the toilet
or she'll drink out of it.

55
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,719
I feel for you. Heh.

56
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,723
I've got a psychotic mommy too.

57
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,126
Leonard, are you in bed?

58
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,635
Yes.

59
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,629
Me too.

60
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,002
Great.

61
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,703
I can't sleep.

62
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,809
Well, I can, so shut up.

63
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:13,277
Do you realize that
in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries...

64
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,613
...a.k.a. Professor Proton,
will be in our apartment?

65
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:20,452
You know if you stay up all night,
you're going to be sleepy tomorrow.

66
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,891
And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon.
And a cranky Sheldon...

67
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,555
...is actually no different
than a regular Sheldon. Good night.

68
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,232
I'm thinking of wearing a tuxedo.

69
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,832
That's not ridiculous. Good night.

70
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,044
Do you have cufflinks?

71
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,649
- No.
- Just as well.

72
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,753
Where can you rent a tuxedo
at 3:00 in the morning?

73
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,616
Okay. Good night.

74
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,656
Nice to meet you, Professor Proton.

75
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,991
Nice to meet you, Professor Proton.

76
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,072
Nice to meet you, Professor Proton.

77
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,732
Nice to meet you, Profe...

78
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,433
Ow!

79
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,231
Leonard?

80
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,231
What?

81
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,594
I still can't sleep.

82
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,867
She really, uh, tuckered herself out
at the park, huh?

83
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,238
Yeah. You two were so cute
playing together.

84
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,213
It was kind of fun throwing a ball
and not having anyone laugh at me.

85
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:57,017
And you were sweet not to throw it too far
so she didn't wear out her tiny legs.

86
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,748
Heh, yeah, that's what I was doing.

87
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:05,219
There were a few moments today
when I felt like we were a little family.

88
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,728
- Really?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,766
I never thought of myself as a mom,
but when we were out...

90
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,027
...I felt like someday we could do it.

91
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,899
Of course we can.

92
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:20,274
Especially if our baby's
as calm and quiet as little Cinnam...

93
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,674
Son of a bitch, she's gone!

94
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:26,410
- Well, where'd she go?
- I don't know. She didn't leave a note.

95
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,417
You were supposed to put her
back in the stroller.

96
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,421
- No, I wasn't. You were.
- No, I wasn't.

97
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,559
- Yes, you were.
- Yeah, well, you throw like a girl.

98
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,033
I'm getting worried.

99
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,666
Relax, Sheldon,
he's only a few minutes late.

100
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,469
Professor Proton was never late
when he was on TV.

101
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,975
You know, every day, 4:00, he was there.

102
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:59,208
Unless tornadoes were ripping apart
East Texas, then we'd join him in progress.

103
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,481
It's him.

104
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,694
Hello?

105
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,058
Well, I see.

106
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,622
Yes.

107
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,493
All right, we can come get you.
Yeah, we'll see you soon.

108
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,467
- Bye.
- Where is he?

109
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:25,109
The third floor landing. The poor old guy's
been walking up the stairs for half an hour.

110
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,406
It's really you.

111
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,619
Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry.

112
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,224
We should have told you
about the broken elevator.

113
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,257
I agree.

114
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:47,032
Professor Proton,
it's an honor to meet you.

115
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,029
Uh, just call me Arthur.

116
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,093
Leonard...

117
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,163
...did you hear that?

118
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,137
Professor Proton said
I should call him Arthur.

119
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,436
That means we're friends.

120
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:04,879
No, a friend would have told me
about the elevator.

121
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,186
Look at me.

122
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:16,661
I can get as close to you as I want without
my mom saying it's going to ruin my eyes.

123
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,256
Is, uh, he dangerous?

124
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,303
Actually, he's a genius.

125
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,335
I am.

126
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,571
That doesn't answer my question.

127
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,015
Mr. Jeffries, I'm Leonard.
This is my girlfriend, Penny.

128
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,980
- Hi.
- Hello.

129
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:47,592
Well, I hope I haven't, uh, kept the kids waiting
too long for the show.

130
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,921
Oh, no, there are no kids.
No, the show's for me.

131
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,090
Come on, I'll race you...

132
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:56,868
...Arthur.

133
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,407
Is the blond girl really your girlfriend?

134
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,807
- Yes, sir.
- You're the genius.

135
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,560
So do you do a lot of appearances
like this?

136
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,703
It's hard to say.
I'm still trying to figure out...

137
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,396
...what this is.

138
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:41,411
We just wanted to hang out with you
and maybe learn a little about your life.

139
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,515
Well, there really isn't too much to tell.

140
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,049
After the TV show was canceled...

141
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:52,122
...nobody in the scientific world
would take me seriously...

142
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:59,054
...so I was forced to do these
children's parties to make a living.

143
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:03,731
That's too bad. But still, working with kids,
it must be rewarding.

144
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,594
You get bit a lot.

145
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,731
Let me see if I have this straight.

146
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,105
You two are physicists...

147
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:21,785
...and you want me to do
a children's science show?

148
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:23,979
Yes.

149
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:29,155
And if there's time, take 12 pictures with us
in seasonal clothing.

150
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,434
You know, I'm a real scientist.

151
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,971
I have a PhD from Cornell University.

152
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,369
Yeah, that's great.
Did you bring your puppet?

153
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,806
No. No.

154
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,984
I hate that puppet.

155
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,282
Oh, no.

156
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:59,686
How could anybody hate
Gino the Neutrino?

157
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,423
It's nice, huh?

158
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,288
I got him for 20 bucks on eBay.

159
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,794
Including the shipping.

160
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,835
I'm awake, right?

161
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,670
This is happening?

162
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,844
- Cinnamon!
- Cinnamon!

163
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,810
You know, maybe she doesn't recognize
her name because of Raj's accent.

164
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,744
Good thinking.

165
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,049
Cinnamon, come to Daddy.

166
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,051
Cinnamon, where are you, my little lamb chop?

167
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,831
- Nice. Heh.
- Thanks.

168
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,194
When this all blows over,
remember that voice.

169
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,700
It's kind of a turn-on. Heh.

170
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,200
It turns you on when I sound like Raj?

171
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,070
Cinnamon!

172
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:01,047
Okay, as I put the egg on top...

173
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,084
...and the flame goes out...

174
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:07,457
...and the air pressure decreases
in the flask...

175
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,826
...what do you think will happen?

176
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,726
- I think I know.
- It's gonna get sucked in.

177
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,400
It's going to get sucked in.

178
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,967
Okay, I didn't know.

179
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,274
Yes.

180
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,238
See, I'm not a scientist like them. Heh.

181
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,580
I figured that out.

182
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,047
- Potato clock. Do potato clock.
- What's that?

183
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,714
I power a clock with a potato.

184
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,918
Shut up. You can do that?

185
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:50,433
I mean, heh, wouldn't that solve
the world's energy crisis?

186
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,137
No.

187
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:01,739
Look, guys, keep your money.
I think I'm done.

188
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:06,782
What's wrong? Is she upsetting you?
Because I can make her go away.

189
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,787
No, she's the only reason
I've stayed this long.

190
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,120
Then what is it?

191
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,222
I don't know. I think I'm just...

192
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:23,458
I just don't want to be
Professor Proton anymore.

193
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,300
Well, how can you say that?
Professor Proton's the best.

194
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,236
What has it ever gotten me?

195
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:37,746
I mean, I'm an 83-year-old man
who has potatoes in his suitcase.

196
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,144
Other scientists think I'm ajoke.

197
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:46,986
And the puppeteer who did Gino...

198
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,153
...well, he also...

199
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,822
...did my wife.

200
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,072
Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something.

201
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,370
- I'm sorry to hear about your troubles.
- Uh, thanks.

202
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:13,313
But if you don't mind me asking, uh,
the potato clock, how does it work?

203
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:18,180
Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?

204
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,028
What do you two talk about?

205
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,863
I wrote a fan letter to you
when I was a child in Texas...

206
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:41,179
...and you sent this autographed picture
back to me.

207
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,870
Do you remember that?

208
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:49,116
I'll give you a hint. I have a bracelet
with my own address on it.

209
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,887
Well, anyway, um,
you may find this hard to believe...

210
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:58,062
...but I didn't have any friends growing up.

211
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,362
No, I get that.

212
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,368
But, um, I did have you.

213
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:12,010
And every day at 4:00,
you'd come to my house on Channel 68...

214
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,270
...and we'd do science together.

215
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,639
If it hadn't been for you, well, who knows
what would have become of me, you know?

216
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:24,153
Instead of a world-class physicist,
I could've wound up as a hobo...

217
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,054
...or a surgeon.

218
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,195
I bet there are important discoveries
being made every day...

219
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:35,197
...because you inspired millions of kids
to pursue science.

220
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,733
In a way, their discoveries
are your discoveries.

221
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:42,931
It's true. A generation of young scientists
are standing on your shoulders.

222
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:49,077
Well, thank you, guys. That means a lot.

223
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,743
Well, it's important you know
how much you mean to us.

224
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:56,245
- Uh-oh.
- Arthur, are you okay?

225
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,920
I'm having...

226
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,752
...a problem with my pacemaker.

227
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,394
I'll call for help.

228
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,492
Any chance we could plug it in
to the potato?

229
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,903
No.

230
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,082
Hello?

231
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:30,915
What do you mean you found my dog?
She's with my friends.

232
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,920
Is she okay?

233
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,486
Thank you. Uh, just text me your address,
I'm on my way.

234
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,760
If she's hungry, go ahead and feed her
but do not give her anything starchy.

235
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,094
She's having risotto for dinner.

236
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:50,430
Your vitals are stable, but let's take you in
for tests just to be safe.

237
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,805
- Want one of us to go in the ambulance?
- I'll do it.

238
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,141
He's not a relative, he's not allowed, right?

239
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,750
- No, it's not a rule. He can go.
- Oh, yes.

240
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,247
I can't catch a break today.

241
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,255
We'll pack up your stuff,
meet you at the hospital.

242
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,154
Sorry things turned out this way.

243
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:15,129
Well, at this point, I'm just glad
someone's carrying me down the stairs.

244
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:23,034
Met my childhood hero,
now I get to ride in an ambulance.

245
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,837
Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar,
this will be the best day ever.

246
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,043
I can't believe we lost her.

247
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:35,082
What was I thinking? I'd be a terrible mom.

248
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,787
Maybe with the first one.

249
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,390
But kids are like pancakes,
the first one's always a throwaway.

250
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,391
- How's this look?
- It's fine.

251
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:51,768
- Where'd you get that picture of her?
- It's not her. I Googled "foo-foo little dogs."

252
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,507
It's Raj. Stay quiet.

253
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:02,013
Hey, heh, bad timing. Bernadette just took
Cinnamon out for a walk.

254
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:06,742
Interesting. Did they take a walk
down Liars'Lane?

255
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,081
- What?
- A lane frequented by liars.

256
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,916
Like you, you big liar.

257
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,256
- You have her?
- Thank God she's okay.

258
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:22,127
Well, I trusted you and you let me down.
The poor thing's been shaking for hours.

259
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,200
- I'm really sorry.
- Hang on, you've had her for hours?

260
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:29,238
Yes. I picked her up and then we both went
for massages to try and calm down.

261
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,432
And then we got Pinkberry.

262
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:36,277
You knew she was okay and you couldn't
pick up the phone to tell us?

263
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,545
- Well, I thought about...
- Don't "well" me, mister.

264
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:40,979
We've been worried sick.

265
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,951
She could have been dead for all we knew.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

266
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,449
- Sorry, I just...
- Sorry's not good enough.

267
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:51,151
Maybe you need to take some time
and think about what you've done.

268
00:18:55,868 --> 00:19:00,396
Nice guilt trip. Heh.
You are gonna be an amazing mom.

269
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,139
Soft kitty, warm kitty

270
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:15,114
Little ball of fur

271
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,823
Happy kitty, sleepy kitty

272
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,994
Purr, purr, purr

273
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,762
Thank you, Sheldon. That was very nice.

274
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,262
- Want me to sing it again?
- No.

275
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,330
The fourth time was the charm.

276
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,709
There anything I can get for you?
Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?

277
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:44,644
No, no, thank you, but I do
have a favor to ask.

278
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,846
- Name it.
- Well, I'm booked to do...

279
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,419
...a children's party tomorrow...

280
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,489
...and frankly, I don't feel up to it.

281
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:57,321
Oh, you're not. You look awful.

282
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,789
Thank you.

283
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:08,333
Anyway, uh, you know
my act better than anybody...

284
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,703
...I was hoping that
maybe you'd fill in for me.

285
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:16,840
Are you saying that you want me
to be Professor Proton?

286
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:20,217
- Yeah.
- Oh, my.

287
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,353
What an honor.
Oh, this is like being asked to...

288
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:27,218
...ascend Mount Olympus
and dine with the gods.

289
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,061
Or a Korean family in Alhambra.

290
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,899
But they'll know I'm not you.

291
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:41,402
Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr?

292
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,404
Sounds great.

293
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:49,374
So in a way, it's like I'm your son.

294
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,406
Whatever.

295
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,248
Father.

296
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,023
Sure, what the hell.
