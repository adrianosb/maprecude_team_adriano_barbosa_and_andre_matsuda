the trackpad is the mouse.

No, doesn't matter which finger.

Yeah, the little envelope.

What do you mean what does it
look like? It looks like an envelope!

That's a Hanukkah present
you're regretting, huh?

00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:46,208
Yeah, I won't say that all senior citizens
who can't master technology...

14
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:50,217
...should be publicly flogged, but if
we made an example of one or two...

15
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:52,878
...it might give the others
incentive to try harder.

I had a great idea.
You know how we're always having...

00:00:57,827 --> 00:00:59,954
...to stop
and solve differential equations...

18
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,691
...like when you do Fourier analysis
or using the Schrodinger equation?

00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:05,698
Howard doesn't. He's only an engineer.

20
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,702
I think we could write a little app that
would use handwriting recognition...

21
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,366
...then run it through
a symbolic evaluation engine.

take a picture of the equation, and bam!

You know, Leonard,
that's actually a valid idea. Very good.

00:01:32,762 --> 00:01:35,424
Can you say that
and not make it sound like I'm a cat...

...who learned how to use the toilet?

No. The two achievements
are equally surprising...

...and equally admirable.

I'd have to give a slight edge to the cat.

of waiting for the answer.

I can't promise anything...

off stuff like this.

a little place of my own over the garage.

You know, if I made more money,
I could take time off...

...and give pretty girls
submarine rides.

What's that, some weird sex thing?

41
00:02:21,645 --> 00:02:24,443
No. You take girls underwater
in your private submarine...

A customer service representative
with an Indian accent...

Because the word secretary

Oh, FYI,
my mother's birthday is coming up.

I'm going to need you

Okay, we need to stop for a minute.

- Oh, of course, you are.

Look at the organizational chart.
You're clearly listed as founder.

Yes, and you're listed
as chief executive officer...

...chief financial officer
and chief operating officer.

You missed chief science officer,
chairman of the board and...

...head of the Secret Santa committee.
- Okay.

107
00:06:27,357 --> 00:06:31,885
You need to get clear on this right now:
I am in charge of this project.

Ooh, Leonard's going all alpha nerd
on Sheldon's ass.

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,425
All right.
I'm not going to argue with you.

Dr. Hofstadter, you have the con.

112
00:06:46,776 --> 00:06:49,643
Thank you. I thought we might start...

113
00:06:49,812 --> 00:06:52,975
...by talking about the user interface.
- Dear Lord, we're doomed.

114

So this button here
will allow you to scan a new equation...

115
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:01,053
...but over here, you can press this...

116
00:07:01,224 --> 00:07:03,920
...and just substitute
new values for the coefficients.

117
00:07:04,093 --> 00:07:05,958
Ha, ha. Good one, boss.

118
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:11,463
- What?
- This diagram.

119
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:13,761
Well, I assume
you were opening with a joke.

120
00:07:13,937 --> 00:07:18,203
It certainly buoyed up this employee's
esprit de corps.

121
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:21,701
It's not a joke. It's the real design.

122
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:26,975
In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks
to make it slightly less embarrassing?

123
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,643
Sheldon, I think this will work.
Let's just try it my way.

124
00:07:30,853 --> 00:07:33,048
Oh, I'm sorry.
I assumed that you wanted...

125
00:07:33,222 --> 00:07:35,281
...candid truth-telling
from your employees.

126
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,983
But I realize now,
you want the mindless nattering...

127
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:40,561
...of complacent yes-men.

00:07:41,164 --> 00:07:43,564
- Are you done?
- Lf you say so, boss.

129
00:07:46,102 --> 00:07:49,594
Right now, this button-press event
is triggering a dummy procedure call.

130
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:51,797
How about this for the app name?

So it spells "Sheldon."

134
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:05,913
Does it? A happy accident.

135
00:08:06,756 --> 00:08:10,317
- We're not doing names now. Howard?
- Like I was saying...

136
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:13,587
...now, it's a dummy procedure.
Eventually, it will drop us in...

137
00:08:13,763 --> 00:08:15,628
If we're not going to give it a name...

138
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:18,528
...can we at least give it
a secret code designation?

139
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:19,793
- No.
- Hear me out.

The atomic bomb
was the Manhattan Project...

141
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:25,033
...Windows 95
was originally Project Chicago.

142
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:29,542
For our app, I would humbly suggest
Project Nodlehs.

143
00:08:30,513 --> 00:08:32,845
That's just Sheldon backwards.

144
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,949
Another happy accident.

145
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:38,648
We're not wasting time
with names right now.

146
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:40,516
I see.

147
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:43,483
- Is that decision open for discussion?
- No.

148
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:45,654
Is the decision to not discuss...

149
00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:47,455
...open for discussion?
- No.

150
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:49,658
Again, right now...

151
00:08:49,832 --> 00:08:52,699
...it's a dummy procedure,
but eventually, it will drop us...

152
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:55,861
I call for a vote of no confidence

While we're doing that, you could take
an aerial tour of L.A. On your flying pig.

307
00:18:02,318 --> 00:18:04,218
Okay, wait right here.

308
00:18:05,721 --> 00:18:06,983
I'll tell you one thing...

309
00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:10,990
...if I get rich, that's the kind of girl
I wanna take on a submarine ride.

310
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:15,061
And yes,
that time I meant it to be dirty.

311
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:18,860
Really?

312
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:20,365
Leonard wants me back?

313
00:18:20,536 --> 00:18:23,733
Oh, yes.
He says they are lost without you.

314
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,434
Well, we sure saw that coming.

315
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,238
- That's right.
- You know what I'm going to do?

316
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:33,609
I am going to sit here
and just let them stew.

No, no, no.
You know, they have suffered enough.

319
00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:43,116
You know,
everybody's suffered enough.

320
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:44,384
The thing is...

321
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,927
...you're gonna have to offer him
a face-saving way out of this.

322
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,293
- How?
- Say you're sorry.

323
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:55,436
Oh, no. Mrs. Mary Cooper
didn't raise her no liars.

324
00:18:56,438 --> 00:19:00,306
Okay. Um, how about this? You know
how you're always trying to learn...

325
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:01,635
...about sarcasm?

326
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,368
- No.
- No?

327
00:19:03,545 --> 00:19:04,807
I was being sarcastic.

328
00:19:06,382 --> 00:19:07,781
Oh, good for you.

329
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,544
All you have to do
is say you're sorry to Leonard...

330
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,482
...but say it sarcastically.

331
00:19:12,655 --> 00:19:14,623
Of course.

332
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,224
He will hear it
as an attempt to mend fences...

333
00:19:17,393 --> 00:19:21,762
...as opposed to the withering
condemnation you and I know it to be.

334
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:25,294
Yeah, that was my plan.
All right. Come on. Let's go.

335
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:28,959
By the way,

- Oh, you're welcome.
- Oh, I'm getting good at this.

Okay, now that you're back on the team
let's get you caught up.

338
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:41,980
Before you begin, let me say again
how deeply sorry I am...

339
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:43,618
...for my earlier behavior...

340
00:19:43,786 --> 00:19:48,189
...and how much I respect and admire
your leadership.

341

Thank you.

...not only can you store
your favorite equations...

344
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:02,199
...but you can forward them
to your friends...

345
00:20:02,371 --> 00:20:05,863
...or post them on Facebook
right from the app.

346
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:08,441
- Well, I must say, I am impressed.
- Thanks.

- You all have put in a lot of hard work.
- We have.

348
00:20:12,114 --> 00:20:15,550
You have taken the most important step
on the road to success:

we have to create a database...

355
00:20:41,376 --> 00:20:43,310
...before you can write an algo-thingy.

Alan Turing defines an algorithm...
