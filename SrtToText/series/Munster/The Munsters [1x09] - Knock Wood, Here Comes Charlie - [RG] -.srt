1
00:00:05,585 --> 00:00:08,213
Morning, dear.
Well, finally.

2
00:00:08,288 --> 00:00:11,815
His Majesty has condescended
to grace us with his presence.

3
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:15,020
Be seated.
Please, Lily, spare me the jokes.

4
00:00:15,095 --> 00:00:17,757
Today's starting out
to be one of those days.

5
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:20,493
Good morning,
Uncle Herman.
Good morning, dear.

6
00:00:20,567 --> 00:00:23,092
Good morning!
Morning, Grandpa.

7
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:27,306
Mmm. What smells so good?

8
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,434
I cut myself shaving.

9
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:34,913
[Banging]

10
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:37,245
Front door.
I'll get it.

11
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:41,720
No, dear. Uh,
not the way you're dressed.
I'll get it.

12
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:44,484
You can never tell when Mr. Right
is gonna come along.

13
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,857
If you go to the door looking like that,
you're liable to scare him off.

14
00:00:55,602 --> 00:00:58,036
[Banging Continues]

15
00:00:58,105 --> 00:01:00,096
Front door.

16
00:01:20,894 --> 00:01:24,330
Well, bless me.
If it isn't Herman.

17
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:26,389
[Laughing]

18
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:30,029
Oh, no. Charlie.

19
00:01:30,103 --> 00:01:33,095
I knew it was gonna be
one of those days.

20
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:42,002
Ah, Lily.
[Chuckling]

21
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:45,533
Herman's twin brother.
Charlie, it's good to see you.

22
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:48,410
Lily, you look just wonderful,
my dear.

23
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:51,940
A lot of people would just die
to have a complexion like that.

24
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:56,920
Don't tell me.
This is little Eddie.

25
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,118
The last time I saw you,
my boy, you were this high.

26
00:03:01,728 --> 00:03:03,696
Ah, Marilyn.

27
00:03:03,763 --> 00:03:08,200
Don't you look pretty, uh, uh, pretty...

28
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:11,237
How do you do in school, dear?
Just fine, Uncle Charlie.

29
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:14,239
Good, good, good.
And now, Uncle Charlie...

30
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:16,832
has a little something
for each of you.

31
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:20,345
Now, let me see.

32
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:22,404
What have I got here?

33
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,719
Eddie, this is for you.

34
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,118
Oh, boy, a bat in the box!
Thank you, Uncle Charlie.

35
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:38,790
And Lily, this is for you.

36
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:42,494
Oh, Charlie!
A new shroud!

37
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh! Ooh.

38
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:49,701
A girl can never have enough of these.

39
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,711
Marilyn, this here's for you.

40
00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:56,648
[Croaking]
[Gasps]

41
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:58,707
Oh.

42
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:03,115
Greatest thing in the world for warts.

43
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:05,123
[Clearing Throat]

44
00:04:05,191 --> 00:04:08,922
Don't worry, Grandpa.
Old Charlie hasn't forgotten you.

45
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:10,986
Good.

46
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:15,868
Oh. Oh!

47
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:18,166
It's a box of cigars.

48
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,172
And the box, you see,

49
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,731
is a great place to keep your ashes.

50
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,971
[Laughing]

51
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:29,243
But, uh, tell me, where's Herman?

52
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:32,376
He can't still be nursing a grudge
against his own twin brother.

53
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:35,285
Of course not, Charlie.
He loves you.

54
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:39,018
He'll be right down.
Oh, no, he won't.

55
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:41,287
What's in the other suitcase,
Uncle Charlie?

56
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:44,159
That?

57
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,666
That, Marilyn, my dear,
is a little invention...

58
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:50,760
that is going to make your Uncle Charlie
a million dollars.

59
00:04:50,837 --> 00:04:53,897
[Lily] "A million dollars'"?
[Grandpa]
Oh, an invention.

60
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:57,205
By the way, I happen to be
a bit of an inventor myself.

61
00:04:57,277 --> 00:04:59,268
Do you mind if I take a look at it?

62
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:01,337
Delighted.

63
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:06,918
Oh.

64
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:08,921
What does it do, Uncle Charlie?

65
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:12,390
It extracts uranium from seawater.

66
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:16,520
"Extracts uranium from seawater"?
I don't believe it.

67
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:19,531
If you will allow me...
Marilyn, please.

68
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:22,500
I'll show you how it works.

69
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:26,232
See? Good old everyday
garden variety seawater.

70
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:29,469
It contains
.047 grains of uranium.

71
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,567
Now, let me see here.

72
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:33,806
I turn the machine on.

73
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:43,951
Now I add the water.

74
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:04,043
Oh!
Is that really uranium?

75
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,169
There's one sure way to find out.

76
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:08,806
I'll fly down to my laboratory
and get my Geiger counter.

77
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:11,976
Oh, no, no, no.
Uh, Grandpa, don't do that.

78
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:13,986
It's not necessary.

79
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:16,079
I mean, I have my own.

80
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:18,886
I always carry
a Geiger counter with me.

81
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,188
[Soft Crackling, Grows Louder]

82
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:25,424
[Laughing]

83
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:27,864
You'll make a fortune.
Why, do you realize...

84
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:30,528
that uranium is worth
its weight in gold?

85
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:33,538
Well, what do you know?

86
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:36,131
[Chuckling]

87
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:38,200
Well...

88
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,640
It's getting late.
I'd better find me a hotel.

89
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:46,117
Say "how do you do"
to Herman for me.

90
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:49,087
Funny. I have a feeling
that boy's been avoiding me.

91
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:52,921
- You're darn right I am.
- You're going to stay here with us.

92
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:56,519
After all, you're Herman's
only living relative.

93
00:06:56,596 --> 00:06:59,588
Oh, Lily, how sweet.
Well, if you insist.

94
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:03,268
Eddie, come along, my boy.

95
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:06,499
You and me are going to dig up
a little snack first.

96
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:16,945
Huh. It's easy to see
who got all the personality
in that family.

97
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:18,574
[Clearing Throat]

98
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,610
[Clearing Throat]

99
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:24,657
Guess what, Herman.
Charlie is staying with us.

100
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:26,658
He's doing no such thing.

101
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:30,162
I want him and his phony uranium machine
out of this house this instant!

102
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,164
Herman Munster!

103
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:35,292
How can you talk like that
about your own flesh and blood?

104
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:37,302
Because I've known him
longer than you.

105
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,567
Charlie Munster is a scoundrel
and a con artist from way back.

106
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,167
The doctor who put him together didn't
have an honest bone in his whole laboratory.

107
00:07:44,244 --> 00:07:46,405
Oh, Herman, you're just jealous.

108
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,677
Why, having Charlie here in the house
is like a breath of fresh earth.

109
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,550
I agree with Uncle Herman.
There's something not just right
about Charlie.

110
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:56,953
Marilyn's right.

111
00:07:57,023 --> 00:07:58,957
Just why is he showing up now?

112
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:02,859
I'll tell you why.
Lily, he's heard about that $5,000...

113
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:05,363
your grandmother left you
the last time she died.

114
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:07,956
And he's here to cheat you out of it
with that uranium machine.

115
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:11,299
Why, shame on you, Herman.

116
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:14,602
And just because of that,
I'm gonna check this machine...

117
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:17,802
and prove how wrong you are
about Charlie.

118
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:23,611
Meanwhile, I insist he stay here.

119
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:27,244
All right. All right.
But you will regret it.

120
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,778
I keep telling you... Charlie's always been
the white sheep in this family.

121
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:34,156
- When are you gonna believe me? When?
- Nevermore.

122
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:45,328
Just a minute. He's right here.
Uncle Charlie, telephone.

123
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:47,339
The man says it's important.

124
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:50,035
Oh. Well, I wonder who that can be.

125
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:54,569
I distinctly instructed my secretary
not to tell anybody where I was.

126
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:56,911
- Munster here.
- This is Leo Kraus.

127
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:58,746
[Coughing]

128
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:02,811
Oh. Oh, uh,
hi, Knuckles.

129
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:06,620
Where's that thousand bucks I put up
for that phony machine of yours?

130
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:08,820
I gave you 24 hours to pay me back.

131
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:11,762
Well... Well, now, a-as... as
a matter of fact,

132
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:14,766
I'm in the process of taking care
of that little matter right now.

133
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:18,702
You've got exactly 24 hours
to hand over the dough;

134
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:20,966
otherwise, you'll get your head broken.

135
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,474
[Chuckles]
It's my head broker.

136
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:25,101
L...

137
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:28,045
I mean, my head broker.

138
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:30,810
Well, thank you very much
for the advice, Mr. Kraus.

139
00:09:30,884 --> 00:09:33,444
I don't think it's gonna be
too difficult to arrange.

140
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,319
You mean to tell me you actually found
a sucker to buy that machine?

141
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:42,623
- There can't be anybody that stupid.
- Oh, but there is.

142
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:45,858
Which brings me to
a very important point.

143
00:09:45,932 --> 00:09:51,131
- I hope you don't mind me selling
one of our machines for $5,000.
- $5,000?

144
00:09:51,204 --> 00:09:55,072
I realize it's a ridiculously small amount,
but you see,

145
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:57,803
it's for a member of my own family...

146
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:02,207
my favorite sister-in-law.

147
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:06,218
But why not?

148
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:09,687
Charlie says his partner gave him
special permission to sell it to us.

149
00:10:09,756 --> 00:10:12,418
He says I couldn't make
a safer investment.

150
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:14,858
He says the ocean is full of uranium.

151
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:17,829
The ocean is also full of suckers,

152
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:20,457
and I'm gonna see to it
that you're not one of them.

153
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:24,196
After all, Grandma did leave
that money to me.

154
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,262
And Grandpa's testing the machine.
He saw it work.

155
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,274
No. It's a silly idea.

156
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:33,142
If your grandmother were alive,
she'd be turning over in her grave.

157
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,514
As long as Charlie stays in this house,
I'm gonna see to it...

158
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:39,050
that that money stays
in the wall safe.

159
00:10:47,994 --> 00:10:51,259
Let me see.
What was that combination again?

160
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:55,631
Oh, yes.
Two turns to the left.

161
00:10:55,702 --> 00:10:57,693
Right to 14.

162
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:00,762
Back to six.

163
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:06,701
Now all we do
is add a little water from the ocean...

164
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,304
and wait for the results
that will prove to Uncle Herman...

165
00:11:09,382 --> 00:11:12,818
how wrong he was
about Uncle Charlie.
[Chuckling]

166
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:15,513
?? [Humming]

167
00:11:15,588 --> 00:11:18,148
[Laughing]

168
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:21,455
Eddie, quick, quick,
get my Geiger counter.
Okay, Grandpa.

169
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:24,018
?? [Humming Continues]
[Soft Crackling]

170
00:11:26,632 --> 00:11:29,624
Huh.
[Loud Crackling]

171
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:33,729
Maybe I used the wrong ocean.

172
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:37,572
- Grandpa, this is nothing but sand.
- Sand? Plain sand?

173
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:41,136
To the scientific mind,
this means just one thing.

174
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:44,115
- Yes, it means that Uncle Charlie...
- Broken.

175
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:47,175
I broke Uncle Charlie's machine.

176
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:57,085
[Herman]
Left three.

177
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:00,422
Right 16.

178
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:04,568
Two turns to the left.

179
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:06,628
Stop at 24.

180
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:18,914
Aw, it's only gold again.

181
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:23,820
Oh, I've gotta fix this machine
before good old Charlie finds out.

182
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:31,920
[Herman]
To the right.

183
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:34,990
Seven left.

184
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,061
Sixteen right.

185
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:43,432
Two turns to the left.

186
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:45,272
[Clicks]

187
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:47,335
And presto!

188
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:55,476
There. I'd like to see Charlie
get his hands on it now.

189
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:58,046
[Laughing]

190
00:13:04,163 --> 00:13:07,326
Oh, Charlie,
I'm afraid the answer is still no.

191
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,427
You know how Herman is.
I talked to him
until I was pink in the face.

192
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:14,405
That sort of puts me in
a funny position, Lily. After all,

193
00:13:14,474 --> 00:13:17,102
my associates were only doing it
as a favor to me.

194
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:21,943
Well, in case anybody wants me,
I'll be down in my laboratory.

195
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:24,005
I've got a little work
to do down there.

196
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:28,583
[Coughing]

197
00:13:28,654 --> 00:13:32,750
I wish he wouldn't do that.
It gets ashes all over the floor.

198
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,990
Can I heat this up for you?
Oh, thank you.

199
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:43,135
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're all out of sugar.

200
00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:46,103
I'll run over to Mrs. Cartwright's
and borrow some.

201
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:48,936
Mrs. Cartwright?
She's the woman next door.

202
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:51,499
She's very fond of Herman.

203
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:54,239
He helps her a lot
around the house.
Ah.

204
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:56,247
She's a bit eccentric though.

205
00:13:56,315 --> 00:13:58,579
Been that way ever since
her husband died.

206
00:13:58,651 --> 00:14:01,745
- A widow?
- Yes. Poor dear.

207
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:04,415
But fortunately,
her husband left her well provided for.

208
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:09,655
Well, that is fortunate. Lily,

209
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:11,663
I'll get the sugar.

210
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:14,825
Allow me.
Sit right down.
Oh.

211
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:17,769
Thank you.

212
00:14:17,837 --> 00:14:19,828
I'll just pop right over.

213
00:14:21,974 --> 00:14:25,603
And I may pick up enough sugar
for both of us.

214
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:32,246
[Knocking On Door]
Come in.

215
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:38,152
Excuse me.
[Gasps]
Oh.

216
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:40,749
Oh, it's... it's you, Mr. Munster.

217
00:14:40,826 --> 00:14:44,762
Oh, hello. Uh...
Mrs. Cartwright?

218
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,560
Oh, of course.
Come in, Mr. Munster.

219
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:51,296
Oh, my, don't you look grand.
What have you done to yourself?

220
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,565
Oh, you mean the suit?
Like it?

221
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,870
Oh, it's very handsome,
and I imagine very expensive.

222
00:14:56,943 --> 00:15:00,845
Custom made. You see,
I made an investment recently...

223
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:04,679
on a little invention
that turned out rather well.

224
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:09,718
Well, on to a good thing
and you didn't even tell me about it.

225
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:12,223
That isn't very neighborly, Mr. Munster.

226
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:15,283
Call me Herman.

227
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:21,228
That's right, Knuckles.
I got the five grand.

228
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,031
You can call off your boys.
I unloaded that crazy machine.

229
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:27,629
Some old biddy named Cartwright.

230
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:30,403
I'm on my way now with the loot.

231
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:32,706
I gotta blow town quick
before my brother finds out.

232
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:36,475
And, Charlie, don't do anything cute
or your frame will float.

233
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:48,223
Charlie sold that machine
to Mrs. Cartwright?

234
00:15:48,294 --> 00:15:50,262
I was just talking to her
through the barbed wire fence.

235
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:52,263
She's floating on air.

236
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:54,731
She'll make the fortune
we missed.

237
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,930
Lily, that machine is just what
I told you it was... a phony.

238
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:01,030
- "A phony"?
- That's right.

239
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:04,235
I just sent Marilyn downtown
to the National Chemical Institute,

240
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,835
and they told her that
while seawater is full of uranium,

241
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:08,846
there's absolutely
no way of extracting it.

242
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:11,246
Oh, Herman,
you were right about Charlie.

243
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:14,286
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna have to buy back
that machine.

244
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:16,844
But that will take every last cent
of Grandma's legacy.

245
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:21,325
The good name of Munster
is more important
than any amount of money.

246
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:24,853
Oh, serves me right
for trusting Charlie.

247
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,262
If you don't learn to be more careful,

248
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,767
the next time Grandma dies,
she'll leave her money to someone else.

249
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,870
After I'm finished with this,
I'm gonna kick Charlie out of here...

250
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:39,638
every lock, stock and monocle of him!

251
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:43,114
Two turns to the left.

252
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:46,948
Right 14. Left...

253
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:49,010
Oh, the heck with it!

254
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:01,998
So you see, Mrs. Cartwright,
the machine is actually worthless.

255
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:04,229
So I wouldn't want you
to get stuck with it.

256
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:07,568
If it's worthless,
why did you sell it to me?

257
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,507
That wasn't me.
That was my twin brother.

258
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:14,103
Your twin brother? Oh!

259
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,047
Oh, no, no, Mr. Munster.

260
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:19,676
There couldn't possibly
be two like you.

261
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:23,518
It's really true.
But that's not important now.

262
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,922
Mrs. Cartwright, I'll pay you back
your whole $5,000.

263
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:29,825
I don't know.
I mean, if you'd go
to all the trouble...

264
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:34,229
of changing your clothes
and making up that story
about a twin brother,

265
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,427
you must want that machine
pretty badly.

266
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:39,437
I'm just trying to do the right thing.

267
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:42,099
Well, in that case,
you can have it...
Good.

268
00:17:42,174 --> 00:17:45,143
For $5,500.

269
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:47,441
But, Mrs. Cartwright,
you only paid 5,000.

270
00:17:47,513 --> 00:17:49,743
I know. I know.

271
00:17:49,815 --> 00:17:52,181
But a poor, defenseless widow
like me...

272
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:56,051
has got to make a teeny-weeny
bit of profit.

273
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:58,181
That's the democratic way.

274
00:18:03,963 --> 00:18:05,954
[Grandpa]
Charlie.

275
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:11,767
Charlie, you're not leaving
without saying good-bye?

276
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:16,433
Charlie, I guess you're mad
because they told you.

277
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:18,670
Told me what?
That I broke your machine.

278
00:18:18,744 --> 00:18:21,679
But I didn't mean to.
I was just trying...
That's quite all right, Grandpa.

279
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:23,942
That's not my problem any longer.

280
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:27,645
You see, I sold that old machine
to Lady Cartwright.

281
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,950
Ooh. But she'll be glad to know
that I fixed it.

282
00:18:30,022 --> 00:18:33,150
It works just fine now.
But, you see, someone
took it out of the lab,

283
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:35,159
and I still have
a few adjustments to make.

284
00:18:35,227 --> 00:18:37,957
Forget the machine, Grandpa.
I'm leaving now.

285
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,021
Cheers.

286
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:48,296
"Fixed it"?

287
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:56,441
What do you mean, "fixed it"?

288
00:18:56,515 --> 00:19:00,451
Well, look, just a few minutes ago,
I made this with the machine.

289
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,510
Huh?

290
00:19:04,924 --> 00:19:07,916
Look at this.
[Crackling Loudly]

291
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:13,290
What do you think?
That's uranium?

292
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:15,356
It ain't bat feathers.

293
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:39,458
Ah, Mrs. Cartwright,

294
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:42,426
I've decided not to sell you
my uranium machine.

295
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:45,396
I have to have it back.
Yes, I know.

296
00:19:45,464 --> 00:19:48,592
Oh, fine.
So, here's your money.

297
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,601
Let me have the machine.

298
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:54,435
Mr. Munster, you've already
given me the money back
and taken the machine.

299
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:56,600
When did I do that?

300
00:19:56,675 --> 00:19:59,007
Just before you changed your clothes.

301
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:01,046
But I didn't change my clothes.

302
00:20:01,113 --> 00:20:03,047
Wait a minute.

303
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:07,176
This fellow who gave you
the money back,
was he about this tall?

304
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:09,847
Yes.
Was he built like me?

305
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:12,982
Uh-huh.
Well, that explains it.

306
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:15,424
That was my twin brother.
Brother.

307
00:20:16,428 --> 00:20:19,226
Now that we own this thing,
what are we gonna do with it?

308
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:21,232
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do with it.

309
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,201
I'm gonna smash it
into 5,500 pieces.

310
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,830
- Don't do that.
- Why not?

311
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:29,101
It's mine.
I paid for it.

312
00:20:29,174 --> 00:20:31,165
And at least I'm gonna get
the pleasure of smashing it.

313
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:35,009
Charlie Munster,
you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

314
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,844
How could you do this to us
after the way we trusted you?

315
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:40,818
Charlie, you proved one thing.

316
00:20:40,886 --> 00:20:43,047
Water is thicker than blood.

317
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:48,519
I suppose you're right.
I ought to be ashamed of myself.

318
00:20:48,594 --> 00:20:51,654
Charlie, you're no good.
And I'll tell you another thing.

319
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,857
You...

320
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:56,561
What did you say?
I said, you're right.

321
00:20:56,635 --> 00:20:58,569
I am no good.

322
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:02,539
For the first time in my life,
I've been forced to look
myself in the face,

323
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:04,872
and it's a pretty
frightening picture.

324
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:07,139
I get the feeling
I've just been insulted.

325
00:21:07,212 --> 00:21:09,146
Being here with all of you has,

326
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:11,682
well, shown me
the error of my ways.

327
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,413
If you'll just give me another chance,
I'll do my best to make it up to you.

328
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:19,389
Well, if you ask me,
it's a little late for that now.

329
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:22,552
- It's 2:00.
- Shut up!

330
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:25,119
Nevermore.

331
00:21:25,197 --> 00:21:27,995
I realize I've done
a lot of rotten things,

332
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:30,001
but, you see, I've changed.

333
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:33,368
And to prove it, I'm gonna buy
that worthless machine back from you.

334
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:35,532
Oh, yeah?

335
00:21:35,608 --> 00:21:38,475
- W-When do I get paid?
- Nevermore. [Squawks]

336
00:21:38,544 --> 00:21:42,036
- Oh, do shut up.
- He's wound up too tight.

337
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:45,242
I'll pay you this very moment.
Oh, well, l...

338
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:49,151
Here's the money.
Well, Charlie, l...

339
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:56,122
Well...

340
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,828
Charlie, I... guess I misjudged you.

341
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:05,766
We all make mistakes.
[Laughing]

342
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:07,772
We're only human.

343
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,206
Well, cheerio.

344
00:22:11,343 --> 00:22:13,903
At least let me
drive you to the station.

345
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:17,813
Oh, uh, not necessary, old boy.
I already phoned a cab.

346
00:22:19,018 --> 00:22:20,986
Well, ta-ta, all.

347
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:23,647
Don't forget your old Uncle Charlie.

348
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:27,249
Eddie, here's a little something
for your piggy bank.

349
00:22:27,326 --> 00:22:28,793
[Door Opens]

350
00:22:28,861 --> 00:22:32,160
Good-bye, Charlie.
You made the right decision.

351
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:35,257
After all, you can't always get by
on your good looks.

352
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:38,064
I suppose you're right.
[Chuckling]

353
00:22:38,137 --> 00:22:41,106
Good-bye. Good... Good-bye.

354
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:43,664
Good-bye, Charlie.
Charlie.!
Good-bye, Charlie.

355
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:46,905
Charlie!
Was that Charlie?

356
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:48,913
He just left.

357
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:52,144
Oh, I wanted to talk to him.

358
00:22:52,217 --> 00:22:55,550
You know,
he's been acting kind of strange
since I fixed his machine.

359
00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:58,112
- "Fixed his machine"?
- Yeah.

360
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,181
I showed him this batch
of uranium I made,

361
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:04,195
and he hightailed it
over to Mrs. Cartwright
like a bat out of heaven.

362
00:23:04,263 --> 00:23:05,696
[Groans]

363
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:08,665
He tricked me again
with that sob story of his.

364
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:10,725
Darn it!

365
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:25,309
Look, Pop, the quarter's fake too.

366
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:28,544
He gypped us all.

367
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,884
That machine was a phony
until you made it work.

368
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:35,256
I'm glad he took it with him.
I wouldn't want that
machine around this house.

369
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:37,261
- Why not?
- Well, I'll tell you.

370
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:41,698
If he starts fooling with that machine,
there's no telling what may happen.

371
00:23:55,781 --> 00:24:00,514
- Driver, to the airport, and step on it.
- What's the hurry, Charlie?

372
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,918
Knuckles.
Where's the five "G"s?

373
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:08,085
I haven't got it. But, Knuckles,
I've got something much better.

374
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,651
Both you and I
are going to be millionaires.

375
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:12,663
Just let me show you this machine.

376
00:24:12,731 --> 00:24:15,962
You see, now it really works.

377
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:21,600
Okay.
But this time it better be good.

378
00:24:21,673 --> 00:24:24,005
He's in the cab, Grandpa.

379
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:26,010
What was that about the machine?

380
00:24:26,078 --> 00:24:29,172
Oh, nothing.
It's just that the machine...
[Explosion]

381
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:45,694
The machine's
still got a few bugs in it.
