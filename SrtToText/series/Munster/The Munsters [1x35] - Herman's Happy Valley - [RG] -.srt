1
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,224
Lily, Grandpa, Marilyn?

2
00:00:15,462 --> 00:00:17,760
Daddy's home.

3
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,163
Oh! Hello, dear.

4
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:26,466
My, you look happy today.

5
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,701
I am happy, Lily,

6
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:31,039
because, as we say
down at the parlor,

7
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:34,376
this has been a very
monumental day.

8
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:37,315
Has something happened,
Uncle Herman?
Yes, Marilyn.

9
00:00:37,384 --> 00:00:41,616
I have some wonderful news!
Uh, where's Grandpa?

10
00:00:47,027 --> 00:00:49,791
Here I am, Herman.
I was down in the dungeon...

11
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:51,797
helping Eddie
fix his train set.

12
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:54,129
Oh.
[Train Whistle Blowing,
Bell Clanging]

13
00:00:56,737 --> 00:01:00,070
Sounds as though
you got it fixed.

14
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,803
Well, Herman, don't keep us
hanging in midair.
What's your wonderful news?

15
00:01:03,877 --> 00:01:07,677
Well, it's vacation time again,

16
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:10,444
and I have purchased
a beautiful hideaway...

17
00:01:10,517 --> 00:01:13,577
where we can all relax
and enjoy our leisure moments.

18
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:18,090
Translation: Somebody stuck him
with a piece of junk.

19
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:20,388
No such thing.

20
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,419
I bought 10 acres
in Happy Holiday Valley
through an ad in a magazine.

21
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:26,989
You bought 10 acres by mail?

22
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:29,763
You see here?

23
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:31,963
With the purchase
of any homesite,

24
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:34,905
we get the use of their
wonderful recreational facilities,

25
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:39,503
excellent transportation,
and it's smog-free.

26
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:42,173
That means you don't
have to pay for it.

27
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:45,241
Uh, plenty of water.
Close to schools...

28
00:01:45,318 --> 00:01:47,650
Oh, Herman,
it sounds wonderful.

29
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:52,385
"For family fun and relaxation,
come to Happy Holiday Valley."

30
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:55,292
Even I'll have to admit,
that sounds like
the kind of place...

31
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:57,387
I'd like to be found dead in.

32
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:19,478
[Marilyn]
Aunt Lily?

33
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:23,243
I'm ready to leave.
Is there anything
I can help you with?

34
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:26,342
No. I was just
pulling down the blinds,

35
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:29,786
so the house will look
gloomy and lived in
while we're gone.

36
00:03:33,326 --> 00:03:36,159
Oh, we're all going to have
such a wonderful vacation.

37
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:38,823
I'll say!
Bring on the girls!

38
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:42,130
Now, you get back
in your clock!

39
00:03:42,202 --> 00:03:45,069
When is that silly bird
going to get girls off his mind?

40
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:47,698
Nevermore, nevermore.

41
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,643
Get!

42
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:54,976
Well, I guess everything's ready.

43
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:58,245
Good-bye, Spot!
[Roaring]

44
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:07,081
Mom, wouldn't it be better
if we left Spot in the garage?

45
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,323
Oh, no, Eddie. No.
Last time we did,

46
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:12,888
he drank all the gasoline
out of the power mower.

47
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:16,367
And then he got the hiccups and melted
all the wrought-iron furniture.

48
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,302
Are you ready
to leave, Grandpa?
Just a minute.

49
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:28,313
All set?
[Man Screaming]

50
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:30,474
All set.

51
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,848
Herman?
Herman, where are you?

52
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:35,353
[Herman]
I'll be right with you, Lily.

53
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:42,994
I'm, uh talking to
the real estate office
that handles our property,

54
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:45,896
and I'm letting him know
that we're coming up
to Happy Valley.

55
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:51,492
That's right.
This is Herman Munster.

56
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:54,096
I bought 10 acres from your ad.

57
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:56,734
It-It was in that magazine,
the Jujitsu Annual.

58
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,541
Ah, yes. One of our
many satisfied customers.

59
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:02,582
Who is it?
That Munster character...

60
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:05,641
the one that fell for our ad
in that crummy magazine.

61
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:07,983
Uh, yes, Mr. Munster.
What can I do for you?

62
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:11,820
Well, Mr. Walters, I thought I'd take
the family out for a spin today
to see our property.

63
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:14,621
Uh, sir,
do I understand you to say...

64
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:17,720
you are going up to
Happy Holiday Valley?

65
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:20,595
That's right.
We plan to take advantage...

66
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:25,127
of your excellent recreational facilities,
your wonderful transportation
and your marvelous...

67
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:28,606
Uh, sir, uh, when are you
planning to go?

68
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:31,109
- Today.
- Today?

69
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:48,619
Hello?

70
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:50,686
Hello?

71
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:53,832
Hello, hello?

72
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,562
Hmm.
Must have been cut off.

73
00:05:56,636 --> 00:06:01,005
I hope he doesn't think
I hung up on him. He sounded
like such a pleasant fellow.

74
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:03,008
Oh, well.

75
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:10,878
Well, it's on to
Happy Holiday Valley.

76
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:24,057
[Cap Pistols Popping]

77
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:38,171
Well, here we are...
Happy Holiday Valley.

78
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,517
You know, Herman,

79
00:06:45,585 --> 00:06:49,521
I had heard that these
real estate brochures
were inclined to exaggerate.

80
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:52,217
But this is more beautiful
than they described it.

81
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:56,353
Oh, it's just... it's just
absolutely breathtaking.

82
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:59,057
Uh, just as advertised.

83
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:03,034
There are the superb
transportation facilities.

84
00:07:03,103 --> 00:07:05,628
Oh, and look!

85
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:07,696
Plenty of water!

86
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:21,544
Mmm. Nice and soft.
Not like the hard water at home.

87
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:24,055
And look!
There's a playground for kids!

88
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:28,016
Ooh! And here are the excellent...

89
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:31,359
entertainment
and recreational facilities.

90
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,827
Well, I must say...
Hmph!

91
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:39,838
You know, this is a real
swinging place.!

92
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:55,978
It appears that it was fortunate
running into you gentlemen.
Yes, it certainly was.

93
00:07:56,055 --> 00:08:01,015
As I understand it, Mr. Curtis,
you represent, uh,
Cunningham Aeronautics.

94
00:08:01,094 --> 00:08:04,825
We were happy to cancel
our quick trip to Mexico
to talk to you.

95
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:06,957
Good. Now, then.

96
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:13,706
We have plans
to use that area...

97
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:16,469
in and around your
Happy Holiday Valley property...

98
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:18,477
as a missile site.

99
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:21,776
I'm here to make you
a flat offer of $50,000
for the entire piece of land.

100
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:25,113
- It's a deal.
- Barney...

101
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:28,154
The man offered
$50,000, partner.

102
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:30,155
I'm sure you will
go along with me.

103
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:32,919
Yes, Barney.
Fine.

104
00:08:32,992 --> 00:08:35,017
This is our initial proposal.

105
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:37,619
I'll be back
first thing in the morning
to finalize the deal.

106
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:39,790
Good. We'll see you then.

107
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:43,325
Good day.
Good day.

108
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:50,732
Barney, we don't own
all of Happy Holiday Valley.

109
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,404
We unloaded some of it
to that Munster character.

110
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:57,245
Gil, baby, Munster's going up
to look at the property
today, right?

111
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:59,251
Right.
Okay.

112
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:01,719
So he takes one look
at that hunk of junk he bought,

113
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:05,121
we offer to refund his two grand,
which he takes back like that,

114
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:08,558
and we're in the clear
for the Cunningham deal.

115
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:11,597
Yes, but, uh,
do you think it'll work?

116
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:16,124
Look. Anyone who falls
for an ad like ours
has got to be a sucker.

117
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:20,332
This Munster sounds like
a real live one.

118
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:22,772
A real live one.

119
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:34,850
Golly. I haven't had a bite
since we've been here.
Patience, Eddie. Patience.

120
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:38,550
But, gee, wouldn't it be better
if we fished in a stream
with water in it?

121
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:42,789
Eddie, anyone can fish
in a stream with water in it.

122
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:45,160
This is a challenge...

123
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:48,758
the kind of challenge
the youth of today
is so badly in need of.

124
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:50,769
I got one.

125
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:53,601
I got one! I got one!
Play him, Grandpa!
Play him!

Don't let him get away.!
- Oh, boy. This is a whopper!

127
00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:00,236
Stay with him, Grandpa!
Here he comes.

128

Oh, oh!

00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:09,283
Isn't he a lovely one!

Isn't that a beauty?

132
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:19,323
Well, I for one am not
gonna be out-fished.

133
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:24,960
Well, the bait's still good.

[Reel Whirring]

135
00:10:51,364 --> 00:10:53,298
Oh, dear me.

136
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:56,460
I'm afraid I've damaged
the recreational facilities.

137
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,576
Uh, pardon us.
We're looking for a Mr. Munster.

138
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:07,374
Well, I'm his niece, Marilyn.
He's not here right now.

139
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:09,711
Uh, perhaps you'd like to
talk with my Aunt Lily.

140
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:11,977
She's fixing supper.
Aunt Lily!

141
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:19,448
Uh, good day, Mrs. Munster.

142
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:22,585
I'm Mr. Walters, and this is
my partner, Mr. Crane.

143
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:25,130
We, uh, sold you folks
the property.

144
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:27,189
No!

145
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:31,796
You mean, you sold us
this property?
Uh, yes.

146
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:35,329
But put that down.
Violence'll get you no place.

147
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:38,673
Oh! I was just stirring up
some oxtail soup.

148
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:43,079
Oh, I can't tell you
how much we love this place.

149
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:45,344
- You love this place?
- Mmm.

150
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:47,682
It's beautiful.
Isn't it, Marilyn?
Oh, it's lovely.

151
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:51,383
Uh, look, madam, I think
there's something you should know.

152
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:53,652
Uh, this is nothing
but a ghost town.

153

A ghost town!
Isn't that wonderful, Marilyn?

154
00:11:57,397 --> 00:12:01,493
Maybe we'll have company
dropping in on us
over the weekend.

155
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:04,400
[Mooing]
Oh. Excuse us a minute.

156
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,166
My oxtail soup
is getting restless.

157
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,469
What do you think?

158
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:14,638
Maybe they heard about
the Cunningham missile deal,

159
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:16,648
and they're just trying
to boost the price up.

160
00:12:16,716 --> 00:12:19,310
That's right. I'll offer them
double their money back.

161
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:25,519
- Now, you were saying?
- I'll get right down
to cases, Mrs. Munster.

162
00:12:25,591 --> 00:12:29,027
We're ready to pay you
double your money
if you'll sell us the property back.

163
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:31,290
Oh, my, no.

164
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:36,495
We're all so crazy about it,
and I'm sure my husband
wouldn't sell it at any price.

165
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:39,197
Good day, gentlemen.

166
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,408
Come on, Gil.
I got another angle.

167
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:44,534
Uh, thank you
for your time, madame.

168
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,341
And thank you
for your flattering offer.
But you understand.

169
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:53,010
It's so hard to find a good
vacation spot since they
closed down Devil's Island.

170
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:56,752
Yes. Well, uh, good-bye.

171
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,925
You said you had an angle,
Barney. What was it?

172
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:11,993
Get in.

173
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:16,867
Look. We can't buy
the place back,

174
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:19,434
so we'll scare 'em off, see?

175
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:23,039
This is a ghost town, right?
Right.

176
00:13:23,116 --> 00:13:26,483
So tomorrow night,
we'll turn it into
a real ghost town.

177
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:28,747
Now, these Munsters are going
to be nervous anyway,

178

spending their first night
in this dump.

179
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,552
Wait till they hear
strange voices and screams
and the whole works.

180
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:39,587
They'll go out of their skulls,
and tomorrow they'll be begging us
to take the place back.

181
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:45,897
Barney, that's a $50,000 idea.

182

Here we are.

That's lovely.
Just what the room needed.

185

Eddie, it's almost time
for you to go to bed.

186
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:04,881
When are you and your father
going to be through with the comics?

187
00:14:04,957 --> 00:14:06,925
Just a second, Mom.

Uh, read me another one.

I have to go to bed.

Oh, darn, darn! Lily?

196
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,541
- Just one more?
- No, Herman.

197
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,316
Eddie has to get to bed.

198
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,824
Could I have my cowboy outfit
back now, Pop?

199
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:42,417
I'm not though playing
with it yet, Eddie.

200

All right. Good night, Pop.

See what the boys
in the back room will have.

203
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:08,286
Herman, will you stop
playing cowboy...

204
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:10,845
and go outside and get
some wood for the fire?

205
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:12,914
Right away, dear.

Hmm. And it looks
so easy on television.

00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:37,914
Herman. The firewood.

00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:41,810
Yes, Lily.

00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:57,229
Oh! Some daughters marry doctors.
Some daughters marry dentists.

212
00:15:57,303 --> 00:15:59,567
You had to marry Henny Youngman.

213

Never mind, Grandpa.

Oh, there's some!

I think Herman's found some wood.

Don't you just love
to watch a fire?
Lily,

217

I've seen Chicago, San Francisco
and the burning of Rome.

You've seen one,
you've seen 'em all!

Where'd you get
all the wood, Herman?

I had to break up
a building, dear.

I do hope there was
no one in it.

Oh, Lily, I've been thinking
about those two men.

224
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:44,441
You said they were so anxious
to buy this property back.
I wonder why.

Oh, it's very simple, dear.
They probably realized...

There's a story going around...

232
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:18,105
that Big Billy comes back every year
and really spooks this place.

233
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:20,118
And today is June 6.

234
00:17:20,186 --> 00:17:22,984
You big dummy. That's just
a story made up for the tourists...

to give the place
some glamour.

for a vacation.

00:18:12,338 --> 00:18:15,637
You know, this reminds me
of the places I used to haunt
in the Old Country.

244
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:19,872
We used to sit around
the fireplace just like this
and talk to our relatives,

in hundreds of years.

to answer him?

to Happy Valley again
for the next weekend?

307
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,344
[Sighs]
I'm afraid not, Eddie.

308
00:23:20,412 --> 00:23:23,279
Your father has just sold
all the property up there.

309
00:23:23,348 --> 00:23:25,612
But, gee, that was the only place
we ever went to...

310
00:23:25,684 --> 00:23:27,811
that seemed like home.

311
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:29,820
Now, now, Eddie.

312
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:33,380
You must not question
your old dad's decision.

313
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:36,724
Uh, that's right, Eddie.

314
00:23:36,795 --> 00:23:39,161
We sold that property
to a very nice firm...

315
00:23:39,231 --> 00:23:41,358
Cunningham Aeronautics.

316
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:43,697
These kind people
are working on a missile...

317
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:46,966
which, in time of trouble,
is gonna solve all our problems...

318
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,200
by blowing up the world.

319
00:23:49,274 --> 00:23:51,936
Gee, Pop, if we can't go
to Happy Valley,

320
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,274
where will we spend
our vacations?

321
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:57,941
Eddie, that's, uh...
that's a very good question.

322
00:23:58,016 --> 00:24:01,144
Eddie, we can always enjoy...

323
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,552
the peace and solitude...

324
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:06,716
of our own little nest
right here.

325
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:09,556
And as Frank Sinatra
has said...

326
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:12,153
on so many occasions,

327
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:15,667
be it ever so humble,
there's no place like home.

328
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:20,328
[Roaring]

329
00:24:20,405 --> 00:24:22,339
[Explosion]

330
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,976
Yes, Eddie.

331
00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:29,707
Give me a house
by the side of the road,

332
00:24:29,782 --> 00:24:31,716
and I'll be a friend to man.

333
00:24:39,758 --> 00:24:42,818
I thought Edgar Allan Poe
was a crackup.

334
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:45,295
Ooh!
