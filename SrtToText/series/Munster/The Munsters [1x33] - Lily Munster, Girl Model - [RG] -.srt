1
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,025
Herman, would you like
to go to a movie tonight?

2
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,695
Oh, thank you, dear,
but I'm working on my hobby.

3
00:00:26,573 --> 00:00:28,803
Uh, Herman?
Hmm?

4
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:32,606
You're supposed to build the ship
inside the bottle.

5
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:37,013
How are you gonna get it in
when it's finished?
No trouble at all, dear.

6
00:00:39,286 --> 00:00:41,220
It's easy when you cheat.

7
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,189
Grandpa, how 'bout you?
Would you like to take me
to the movies?

8
00:00:50,263 --> 00:00:52,595
Movies? What's playing?

9
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:56,363
To Kill a Werewolf
and Vampires of Blood Alley.

10
00:00:56,436 --> 00:00:59,132
Lily, I go to the movies for escapism.

11
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:03,506
I don't wanna see everyday people
doing everyday things.

12
00:01:03,577 --> 00:01:06,478
Besides, I have to help Eddie
with his homework.

13
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:08,480
Oh. Again?

14
00:01:11,818 --> 00:01:14,286
How about Marilyn?
Maybe she'll go with me.

15
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:16,845
She went over to
one of her girlfriend's home.

16
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:22,523
Well, that's it. Hmph.

17
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:24,655
Herman has his hobbies,

18
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:27,791
Grandpa and Eddie study together,

19
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:30,928
Marilyn has her school friends, and...

20
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:32,938
what do I have?

21
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:35,804
Absolutely nothing.

22
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:38,868
Well, I'm not just gonna
sit around here and deteriorate.

23
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:41,641
Why not? I've been doing it for years.

24
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,781
Well, even if I'm not needed
around here,

25
00:01:46,853 --> 00:01:50,380
I can still make a useful
contribution to society.

26
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:52,391
I'm going to get a job!

27
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:54,484
- Ajob?
- AJob?

28
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:56,495
Ajob!

29
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:08,193
Oh, Marilyn, here's one:
"Secretary wanted.

30
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:11,601
Must type 120 words a minute."

31
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:15,232
She can't even write
a note to the milkman
without a dictionary.

32
00:03:15,308 --> 00:03:17,708
There's one, Aunt Lily.

33
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:19,904
"Comptometer operator wanted."

34
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,073
"Comptometer operator."

35
00:03:22,148 --> 00:03:25,606
She'd probably get the thing out
in traffic and hit somebody.

36
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:29,018
Well, Marilyn, I have
six or seven ads circled here.

37
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:31,284
I want to get started early.

38
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:35,021
Would you come upstairs with me
and help me choose something nice
to wear to the interviews?

39
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:37,029
I want to look my very best.

40
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:40,624
Yes, Aunt Lily. It's very important
you make a good impression.

41
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,674
You know something, Grandpa?
I think she's very serious
about getting a job,

42
00:03:50,744 --> 00:03:53,542
and I am totally against it!

43
00:03:53,613 --> 00:03:55,911
What am I gonna do?

44
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:58,280
Herman, listen to me.

45
00:03:58,351 --> 00:04:01,912
Lily is not going to get a job.
She has no experience.

46
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:06,925
Take my advice
and just ignore the whole thing.

47
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:10,724
You don't think
I should stand up to her?

48
00:04:10,797 --> 00:04:13,357
Order her to give up this idea...

49
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:16,266
and put my foot down as lord
and head of the household.

50
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:18,270
No, I don't.

51
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:20,704
Well, good,

52
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:23,834
'cause every time I do that,
she laughs at me.

53
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:43,229
Well, Mr. Franklin?

54
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:45,924
L... I'm sorry, Mrs. Munster,
but I just remembered.

55
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:48,968
We filled this position
this morning.

56
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:18,730
[Engine Starts]

57
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:44,181
Ready now, Irving.

58
00:05:45,258 --> 00:05:47,249
This is Colette.

59
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:02,432
[Sighs]

60
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:06,138
That will do, Colette.
But he didn't say anything.

61
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:10,171
His eyes plainly said no.
Well!

62
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,718
Next, this is Millicent.

63
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:32,134
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no. No, no, no.

64
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,035
I think not, Millicent.

65
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:45,214
I hope he gets a concussion.

66
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:51,213
Irving, my new line of clothes...

67
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,749
is not designed for
the Northwest Mounted Police.

68
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:59,692
I need a model.
A model who is different.

69
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:01,700
Someone with a,

70
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:06,637
a warm, exotic flamboyance.

71
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:09,607
Someone, in short, my dear Irving,

72
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:12,804
who has great... flair!

73
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,616
There's more waiting, Mr. Brastoff.

74
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:19,982
Would you come in, please?

75
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:24,415
This is Lily.

76
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,003
That's what I call flair!

77
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:46,272
Oh! Thank you.

78
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:49,873
[Laughs]
Irving, she's enchanting.

79
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:52,315
Tell those other girls
they can go home now.

80
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:55,115
Yes, Mr. Brastoff.

81
00:07:57,757 --> 00:08:01,955
Lily. Lily, my dear, I don't know
when I've seen a model...

82
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:07,261
who so perfectly reflects the exotic and
mysterious appeal of my new line of dresses.

83
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,995
Oh! Oh, thank you.

84
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:15,939
You see, what I am trying to do here
is to recreate the kind of allure...

85
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:19,672
that was reflected by women
like, oh, Theda Bara.

86
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:22,772
They called her "The Vamp."
That's short for "vampire."

87
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:24,942
But, of course, you wouldn't
know anything about that.

88
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:29,819
Oh, yes, I would!
That's a very common
nickname in my family.

89
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:33,791
Anyway, what I'm attempting here also
in certain of my dresses...

90
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,387
is to bring back an era
that is gone.

91
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:41,866
I'm trying to revive the dead,
if you like.
If I like?

92
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:44,699
I've always thought
that was a fun thing.

93
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:51,409
Lily, I can just picture my customers' faces
at my next showing...

94
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:54,537
when you come out
in a Lazlo Brastoff original creation...

95
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:56,912
and float around the room.

96
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:59,918
Oh! Like this?

97
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:04,518
Lily, you're magnificent!

98
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:06,752
Oh! I rush to embrace you!

99
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:09,522
Ah-ah-ah!
Tut-tut, Mr. Brastoff.

100
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:14,523
Lily, you're hired!

101
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:19,163
Grandpa, it's bad enough
having my wife working,

102
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:23,403
but I just cannot stand
for Lily being a fashion model.

103
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:27,469
Now, Herman, let's not be too hasty.
It may not be all bad.

104
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:31,415
After all, modeling
is a very respectable profession.

105
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:33,577
Well, maybe.

106
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:36,053
And she'll make good money,
and the work is easy.

107
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:41,526
Why, all she has to do is just
put on the latest creations and...

108
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:44,392
walk up and down
in front of the customers.

109
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:47,194
Well, I guess you could be right.

110
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,394
- Now, when these men...
- Men?

111
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:52,734
Well, you know.
Most of the out-of-town buyers are men.

112
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:56,002
You know what they look like.
You've seen their pictures in the magazines.

113
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:58,202
Those handsome, well-dressed fellows...

114
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:02,214
with two or three chicks on each arm.

115
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:04,546
I'll bet those rascals
have a ball every day...

116
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:08,553
just sitting there and watching those models
come out in negligees and swimsuits...

117
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:12,216
[Chuckling]
And take 'em out to dinner at night.

118
00:10:15,194 --> 00:10:17,458
You ain't kiddin', Herman.

119
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:22,331
Boy, I tell you. There must be
a lot of hanky-panky
goes on in that business.

120
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:25,667
[Laughing]

121
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:33,971
I just remembered. The hanky they'll
be playing panky with is my wife.

122
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:38,313
You know, you're right.
It's not only your wife, it's my daughter.

123
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:42,013
Lily! Lily!

124
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:44,318
You come right down here this minute!

125
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,757
I am not gonna let her take that job,
and that's that!

126
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:50,318
Uncle Herman,
you were calling Aunt Lily?
You're darn right I was.

127
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:56,096
I want you to get that man-chasing
home-wrecker right down here,
tout de suite.!

128
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:58,228
You can't mean Aunt Lily.
I can and I do.

129
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:02,104
Now get her down here!
Well, I'm afraid I can't,
Uncle Herman.

130
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:05,576
You see, she left about an hour ago
for her modeling job.

131
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:07,636
But...

132
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:15,453
She left an hour ago
for her modeling job.
[Grunts]

133
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:18,046
Well, Herman, what do you think of that?

134
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:21,218
I'm so mad, I could go
right through the ceiling!

135
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:25,187
[Crash]

136
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:31,103
Herman! Herman, will you come down here
and talk this thing over sensibly?

137
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,697
This is no time to be hiding in the attic!

138
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,477
Eddie, have you seen
your father and Grandpa?

139
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:45,381
Oh, they're down in the dungeon
working on something.

140
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:48,215
It must be real neat because
when I knocked on the dungeon door,

141
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:50,414
they told me to get lost.

142
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,823
You suppose they're figuring out
some way to keep Mom from working?

143
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:57,192
Eddie, where did you hear
about that?

144
00:11:57,263 --> 00:12:00,699
Some people have awfully big ears.

145
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,701
Neat, isn't it?

146
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:12,808
Grandpa, what are you doing
with all these little jars?

147
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,007
Well, Herman, if Lily's
going to have a job as a model,

148
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:20,212
we are gonna fight fire with fire.

149
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:23,187
You mean we're gonna burn down
the place where she's working?

150
00:12:23,256 --> 00:12:26,987
No, Herman.
If she is gonna make you jealous,

151
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,528
you are gonna make her jealous...

152
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:32,530
by becoming a playboy.

153
00:12:32,598 --> 00:12:35,192
Oh!

154
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:38,396
You know, I've always
fancied myself as a playboy.

155
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:41,929
GeorgieJessel has always been my idol.

156
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:47,947
Yeah, well, my instant disguises
are a little more up to date than that.

157
00:12:48,014 --> 00:12:50,915
Mel Torme.

158
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:52,951
Dean Martin.

159
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,680
"Pat Boone"?
How did that get in here?

160
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:02,723
"Mr. Clean"?

161
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:05,127
Herman, don't laugh.

162
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:08,634
He's a real big swinger
when he's not making commercials.

163
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:12,102
Don't let that earring fool ya.

164
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:16,269
Oh! Here it is!
[Laughs]

165
00:13:16,342 --> 00:13:19,334
Frank Sinatra.
Oh, good, good, fine.

166
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:22,472
Give me one of those.
[Laughing]

167
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:27,315
You know, I've always felt
rather simpatico with Frankie.

168
00:13:27,386 --> 00:13:30,082
Okay, Herman, down the hatch.

169
00:13:35,094 --> 00:13:37,028
[Gulps]

170
00:13:42,735 --> 00:13:44,965
Ring-a-ding-ding.

171
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:55,680
What's the matter, Grandpa?

172
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:57,682
Don't I grab you?

173
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,584
No, Herman.
You're not as young as you used to be.

174
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:03,986
I don't think you're up to being Sinatra.

175
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:09,289
In fact, these days, I don't know
if Sinatra is up to being Sinatra.

176
00:14:12,632 --> 00:14:15,795
Let me see now. "Mickey Rooney. '"

177
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:21,272
"Cesar Romero."

178
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:25,001
No, no.

179
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,017
Richard Burton.

180
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:36,452
Oh, good.

181
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:39,753
But I'm surprised
they let these in the country.

182
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:43,090
Don't you see they're marked
"for adults only"?

183
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:46,723
Ain't exactly taking kiddies' aspirin there.

184
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:53,172
There you go, Herman.

185
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:55,173
Cheerio.

186
00:14:58,244 --> 00:15:00,178
[Gulps]

187
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:09,386
To be or not to be.

188
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:11,787
That is the question.

189
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:19,992
No. No, I don't think so, Grandpa.

190
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:24,560
I just want to make Lily jealous,
not drive her out of her mind.

191
00:15:24,637 --> 00:15:27,003
Listen, Herman,
if you're going to be a playboy,

192
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:29,507
I've got just the thing.

193
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:32,135
[Laughs]
A Texas playboy!

194
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:38,049
Why are the Texas pills so big?

195
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:41,280
Well, only one-eighth is chemical.
The rest is baloney.

196
00:15:41,354 --> 00:15:43,549
Go ahead. Force it down.

197
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:48,660
[Gulps]

198
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:56,926
Y'all come by and see us
at the ranch anytime, hear?

199
00:15:58,137 --> 00:16:00,071
[Laughing]

200
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:03,040
Oh, Herman, you're irresistible!

201
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:06,567
Any woman who saw you now
would just flip her lid.

202
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:09,581
Uncle Herman,
will you be home for lunch?

203
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:13,483
[Laughing]

204
00:16:13,552 --> 00:16:18,046
Oh, Uncle Herman, you're the funniest thing
I've ever seen in my whole life!

205
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:22,060
What are you trying to do, gonna play
cowboys and Indians with Eddie?

206
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:26,531
No, I'm not. And furthermore,
I won't be home for lunch.

207
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,533
Oh, all right.

208
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:31,331
[Continues Laughing]

209
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:37,803
If I'm so irresistible,
how come Marilyn laughed at me?

210
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:42,541
Herman, I think I better put
a little insurance in this package.

211
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:46,483
Now, when you walk into that shop
where Lily is modeling,

212
00:16:46,552 --> 00:16:50,010
you are going to have
a beautiful girl on your arm.

213
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:54,989
But I don't want to go there
with a strange girl.

214
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:57,859
Herman, please.
I'll mix one up for you.

215
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:07,270
And now, I'm gonna add
a touch of 36-25-36.

216
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,311
I'll have a beautiful girl for you
in ten seconds.

217
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,781
Grandpa, are you sure this will work?

218
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,410
Well, l...
Herman, of course it'll work!

219
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:22,750
It'll work 100 percent!

220
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:43,698
[Grandpa's Voice]
Well, what do you think, big boy?

221
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:47,608
I guess I'll have to settle
for 80 percent.

222
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,807
Come on, Herman.
Let's get going.

223
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:53,774
Uh, you know something, Grandpa?

224
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:57,414
Every husband should have
a father-in-law just like you.

225
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:07,926
[Woman Announcing]
Here we see Carlotta again,

226
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,300
this time in a sparkling
two-piece ensemble.

227
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:16,569
So correct and charming
for both those special parties...

228
00:18:16,642 --> 00:18:18,633
and delightful home entertaining.

229
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:24,446
And now for his most
exclusive collection,

230
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:30,149
Lazlo Brastoff presents a beautiful
pure silk suit in tones ofblue.

231
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:35,221
Oh, beautiful.! Beautiful.!

232
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:38,889
Well, thank you, Mr. Brastoff.
No, not you. The suit!

233
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:45,260
Lily.! Mmm.! You are magnifiicent.!

234
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:54,572
Oh, Lily, you are out of this world.

235
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:58,344
Oh, thank you, but I haven't
been there for years.

236
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:04,185
Mr. Brastoff, I have such news for you
that I think I shall just go to pieces.

237
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:06,190
Irving, you're stealing my thunder.

238
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:10,058
Girls, in the audience...
and I saw it with my own eyes...

239
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:13,098
there's a wealthy Texan
with his girlfriend!

240
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:18,000
He would have his girlfriend.
That's exactly what I'm in the market for...
a wealthy Texan.

241
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,300
I guess you wouldn't be interested,
though, would you, Lily?

242
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:23,273
Oh, my! Certainly not.

243
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:26,505
I have the most wonderful.
Handsome, sweetest,

244
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:29,207
kindest man
waiting at home for me.
Oh, lucky you.!

245
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:34,617
I could travel to the four corners of the earth,
and I'd never find anybody like that.

246
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:37,212
Ah, true, true.

247
00:19:43,028 --> 00:19:45,724
Mmm! Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

248
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:49,131
Now another Brastoff triumph.

249
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:54,696
Sheer magic, as worn by
one of our top models, Lily Munster.

250
00:19:57,076 --> 00:20:02,673
[Woman]
Lily is featuring one of the true
Lazlo Brastoff originals...

251
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:06,707
black velvet pants
with a lovely leopard top.

252
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:11,916
The hat is Russian fox
and is ostentatiously detailed...

253
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:15,620
by the specially designed
lengthy fox stole.

254
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,564
Now isn't that exquisite?

255
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:21,657
It's working beautifully, Herman.

256
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:24,601
Did you see that look on her face
when she spotted us?

257
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,366
Wasn't that something?
[Chuckling]

258
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:29,498
Just keep ignoring her.

259
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:31,770
Yeah.

260
00:20:31,844 --> 00:20:36,543
Grandpa, you've had
a lot of ideas in your time, but this is...

261
00:20:36,615 --> 00:20:39,083
Grandpa. Grandpa.

262
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:41,085
The cigar, the cigar.

263
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:44,020
Oh, yeah, I forgot myself.

264
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:46,319
Wha...
Here.

265
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:53,665
[Chuckles]
Wait'll Lily comes out again.

266
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:56,633
This time
we'll really lay it on thick.

267
00:20:56,702 --> 00:21:00,570
She'll quit her job
right on the spot.

268
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:04,268
Here we see Carlotta again,

269
00:21:04,343 --> 00:21:08,439
this time in a sparkling
two-piece ensemble.

270
00:21:08,514 --> 00:21:12,610
So correct and charming
for both those special parties...

271
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:15,654
and delightful home entertaining.

272
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:21,489
The top is pure silk with a tapered
full-length sheet of ivory silk.

273
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:26,757
What a wolf! Did you see
that look that Texan gave me?

274
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,971
This is working out great.
[Chuckling]

275
00:21:39,044 --> 00:21:41,171
Watch it. Here she comes.

276
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:47,779
- Now this time, Lily truly sparkles.
- How am I doin', Herman?

277
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:51,448
Great. I'll tell you one thing, Grandpa.

278
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:54,959
It's a whole lot better than
when you turned yourself into a frog.

279
00:21:55,027 --> 00:21:58,986
Diamond-studded shoes
add an extra touch ofbrilliance...

280
00:21:59,064 --> 00:22:04,434
to one of Lazlo Brastoff's most beautiful
and eye-catching originals.

281
00:22:04,503 --> 00:22:08,997
Lily, you're sure to be
the belle of any ball.

282
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:11,372
Lovely. Thank you.

283
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:17,605
What happened?
Grab the chair!

284
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:22,216
Oh, this is terrible!
Here, help me pull it off!

285
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:25,256
[Woman]
Somebody do something.!
Oh, my, my!

286
00:22:25,324 --> 00:22:28,487
Madam, I'm so terribly sorry!
Oh, this is terrible.

287
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,495
Watch it, buster!
Huh?

288
00:22:31,563 --> 00:22:34,726
What's the matter?
Haven't you ever seen a girl before?

289
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,793
Say, listen, you.
Take your hands off my grandfather.

290
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:40,805
Grandfather?

291
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:47,673
Lazlo Brastoff,
you have had it.

292
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,345
But, Lily, dear,
you've got to believe me.

293
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:55,614
It was just a misunderstanding.

294
00:22:55,688 --> 00:23:00,785
Huh! The next thing you'll be telling me
is that blonde on your arm was Grandpa.

295
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:03,555
But I tell you, it was Grandpa!

296
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:07,030
You got that job modeling,
and I was just trying
to make you jealous.

297
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:10,591
Oh, that is the most ridiculous story
I have ever heard!

298
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:12,603
But, Lily, it's true!

299
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:15,231
Grandpa's downstairs now,
getting the potion.

300
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:18,367
And when he comes
walking through that door
as a beautiful girl,

301
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:21,311
you're gonna throw yourself
in my arms and beg forgiveness...

302
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,247
just like Constance Bennett does
on the late, late show.

303
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:28,275
[Knocking]
There's Grandpa now.
[Chuckling]

304
00:23:28,353 --> 00:23:30,344
Come in, dear.

305
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:42,192
But, Grandpa, you're not a girl at all!
What happened?

306
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:46,670
What happened? It's empty.
Somebody drank the rest of the potion.

307
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:49,139
Oh, now I've heard everything!

308
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:52,302
But, Lily! Lily, dear...
[Knocking]

309
00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:55,369
Can I come in, Mom?
Yes, Eddie.

310
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:05,449
Eddie, what happened to you?

311
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:10,860
I don't know. I drank something in
Grandpa's lab I thought was a soft drink...

312
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:13,193
and now look what happened.

313
00:24:13,265 --> 00:24:15,199
It's true!

314
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:17,633
Oh, Herman!

315
00:24:17,703 --> 00:24:21,662
Oh, Herman, please forgive me
for ever doubting you.

316
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,674
Thank you, Constance Bennett.

317
00:24:23,742 --> 00:24:28,839
Grandpa, how long
will I stay this way?

318
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:32,680
I don't know.
Two, maybe three hours.

319
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:35,276
Give you a chance to learn
how the other half lives.

320
00:24:35,354 --> 00:24:39,757
But I've gotta pitch on the school
baseball team this afternoon.

321
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:42,692
What will I do?

322
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:45,821
Pray for rain
or learn to pitch underhanded.
