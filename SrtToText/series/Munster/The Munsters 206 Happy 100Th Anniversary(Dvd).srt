1
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,295
Now that's
what I call a body.

2
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,864
They sure knew how to put them
together in the old country.

3
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:33,502
The old family coach. You
know, that body was handmade.

4
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,537
What a fun car.

5
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,985
Oh, look,
isn't that Uncle Boris?

6
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:43,253
That's Uncle Boris,
all right.

7
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,314
He was a real swinger.

8
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,725
Look at this.

9
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,029
It must be some sort
of beauty contest.

10
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,529
Herman,
that's your wedding picture.

11
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:58,168
No wonder they're such
attractive people.

12
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:03,168
The date's right here
in the corner: 1865.

13
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:05,598
Eight...

14
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,903
Herman, doesn't that date
mean anything to you?

15
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,843
Let me see...

16
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:15,113
Oh, yeah, I've got it. That was
the beginning of the War of 1812.

17
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,384
No, 1865.

18
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:24,795
That means that this Saturday, you and
Lily will have been married 100 years!

19
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,630
Oh, boy!
Our anniversary.

20
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,662
And Lily hasn't mentioned
anything about it.

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,367
You know what I'm gonna do, Grandpa?
This Saturday, I'm gonna surprise her...

22
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,341
and buy her
a wonderful gift.

23
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,676
A gift. Good, Herman, good.
What kind of a gift?

24
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,939
Something that will
make her kiss me...

25
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,848
and throw her arms around me
and hug me to pieces.

26
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,687
Herman, okay, all right.
Herman, you're 150 years old.

27
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:56,092
Don't line up anything
you can't handle.

28
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,555
Just think, Aunt Lily...

29
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,362
this Saturday it will be 100 years since
you and Uncle Herman were married.

30
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,458
Oh, yes.

31
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,796
I'll never forget the reception
in the old family mausoleum.

32
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,934
I tell you, some people
got up and danced...

33
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,705
who hadn't danced in years.

34
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,542
What do you think Uncle Herman will
give you for your anniversary?

35
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:20,415
I don't know, but I'm going to
surprise him with a beautiful gift.

36
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,511
Do you think he's
forgotten your anniversary?

37
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:27,956
Of course he has. You know how things
keep flying in and out of his head.

38
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,961
Sometimes I think I should get
the doctor to put in screens.

39
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,925
Oh, looky what we've got
for dessert.

40
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,131
Cherries Jubilee.

41
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:47,197
Thank you, Marilyn.
You forgot to light it.

42
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,671
Here, Lily.

43
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:49,796
[clicking]

44
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,641
Allow me.

45
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,676
Heck, Grandpa,
I wanted to light my own.

46
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:00,912
[clearing throat]

47
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,581
Speaking of what each of us
is gonna do this Saturday...

48
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,784
I was wondering if you had
any particular plans, dear.

49
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,851
This Saturday?
Why do you ask, Herman?

50
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,687
Well, I just thought if you
didn't have any special plans...

51
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,632
I might finish up a little
work down at the parlor.

52
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,595
You're going to work
at the parlor Saturday?

53
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:25,435
We had a little explosion in the back room
and things are still kind of up in the air.

54
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,105
Did you have any plans?

55
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,448
Oh, no. No.

56
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,106
I'll go get some coffee.

57
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,448
Just a minute, Marilyn.
I'll help you.

58
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,484
I'm gonna give some of my dessert
to Spot, while it's still burning.

59
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,016
Come and get it, Spot.

60
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,760
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna surprise Lily.

61
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:51,528
We have $1,200 in our bank account.
I'm going to draw out $1,000".

62
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,162
<i>And buy he:
a super-meats present.</i>

63
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,503
Something really
ring-a-ding-ding.

64
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:08,243
Aunt Lily, did you hear what Uncle
Herman said about working Saturday?

65
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,351
That means he's completely forgotten
your wedding anniversary.

66
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,481
I know he did.

67
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:15,549
But this gives me a chance
to really surprise him.

68
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,790
Marilyn, I'm going to take $1,000
out of our bank account...

69
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,458
and get him
a fantastic present.

70
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,866
You got a problem, Brenton?
Oh, yes, Mr. Hoglan.

71
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:36,070
These two checks just came in at the
same time, against the Munster account.

72
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,012
They're both for $1,000.

73
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:41,684
Well, how much is in the account?
Only $1,200.

74
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,345
There's nothing
we can do about it.

75
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,152
Just send them both back
marked "Insufficient Funds."

76
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:50,490
Oh, goody! I just love to
use that rubber stamp.

77
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,598
How do you like that?

78
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,968
Herman, will you stop waving
that thing in front of my face?

79
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,037
I've seen bum checks before.

80
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,740
Grandpa, how could they do
this to such a sweet fellow...

81
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,608
who just wants to buy his wife
a wedding present?

82
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,610
Now what am I gonna do?

83
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,344
Herman, there's only one
thing you can do: moonlight.

84
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:17,354
You get a part-time job at night to earn
enough money to buy Lily a present.

85
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:22,154
But Lily might get suspicious if I got
extra-curricular nocturnal employment.

86
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:27,154
Herman, then all you have to do is tell
Lily you're working late at the parlor.

87
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,565
Then when you've earned enough money
to buy her the present, you quit.

88
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,102
That's a good idea.

89
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,569
That's a good idea.

90
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,030
You know, Grandpa...

91
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:41,374
when the chips are down, it's nice to
have a no-good sneak like you to turn to.

92
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:47,006
"Insufficient funds."
It's a disgrace.

93
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,647
We Draculas have always had
a little something...

94
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,156
tucked away in the vault
for a rainy day.

95
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,385
I guess you'll just
have to get Uncle Herman...

96
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,428
a less expensive
anniversary present.

97
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,258
Oh, that's a shame.

98
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,360
Wait a minute.

99
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,594
Maybe I could take a part-time
job to earn the money?

100
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,830
Well, you could do that,
Aunt Lily.

101
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,731
What do you suppose
happened to the bank balance?

102
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:14,175
Well, you know, there's always such a
lot of expense when you raise a family.

103
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,405
Last year, Eddie's teeth
started coming in straight...

104
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,048
and we had to buy
a new pair of braces.

105
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,444
Of course, it was worth it.

106
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:25,455
I wouldn't want that boy going
through life with false fangs.

107
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,763
I'm gonna get down there
this morning.

108
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,826
Herman, let me give you
a piece of advice.

109
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,925
When you talk
to the interviewer...

110
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,735
you're a charming, good-looking fellow.
Don't spoil it by being aggressive.

111
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,545
Thank you, Grandpa.

112
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:54,346
"Don't spoil things
by being aggressive."

113
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,843
Herman,
what are you doing?

114
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,057
I'm writing it down
in my goody book.

115
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:01,948
Oh, boy.

116
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,866
Herman, I thought
you'd left for the parlor.

117
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,470
Just leaving, dear.

118
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,336
Lily, I won't be home
for dinner.

119
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,968
I'm working overtime
at the parlor tonight.

120
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:25,174
As a matter of fact, I'm working
late every night this week.

121
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:30,449
Well, Uncle Herman, you just keep
working hard for Mr. Gateman...

122
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,185
and maybe this Thanksgiving he'll
give us another beautiful turkey.

123
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,661
Yes. Remember
the one last year?

124
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,996
It looked so natural,
lying on the platter...

125
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,329
with its legs folded
across its chest.

126
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:48,367
Well, toodle-oo. Come on, Grandpa.
Walk me to the car.

127
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,141
That's a break, Aunt Lily.

128
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,339
With Uncle Herman
working every night...

129
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,475
you'll be able to take a
part-time job in the evenings.

130
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,712
Yes.

131
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,448
Marilyn, I'm going down for
an interview this morning.

132
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,649
The Cleaver Employment Agency.

133
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,568
[knock on door]

134
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,366
Come in.

135
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,739
I'm Mr. Munster.
They said I was next.

136
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,377
Yes, Munster.

137
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,249
I'll close the door. There
must be a draft in here.

138
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,081
You see, there?
You do have a chill.

139
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,825
You really must
keep out of these drafts.

140
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,927
I'll be all right in a minute.

141
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,598
Are you applying
for employment?

142
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,992
Yes, I was looking
for some night work.

143
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:56,404
Offhand, I'd say that your
chances are infinitely better...

144
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,373
of acquiring
the night position...

145
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,076
as opposed to going out
in the daylight.

146
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,580
I mean, I think you'd do fine.
Working at night.

147
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,281
Well, you see, I already do have a day job.
I work in a funeral parlor.

148
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,614
And, frankly,
I really dig it.

149
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,026
Excuse me.

150
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,173
Let me get that straight.

151
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:42,151
You say your previous employment
was as a nurse's aide.

152
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,985
That's right, Mr. Walpole,
with Florence Nightingale.

153
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,953
You say you'd like to take a

You were flirting with a big goon
and you didn't even know it was me.

309
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,795
Shame, shame, shame.

310
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,398
Herman Munster, I'll teach you.
Take that.

311
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,099
You two-timer.

312
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,745
Poyen this is the worst
morale I've ever seen.

313
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,577
These people are fired.

314
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,182
Aunt Lily, Uncle Herman, you're
acting like a couple of children.

315
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,857
Now, listen, you two. I've got
this whole thing figured out.

316
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,792
After you hear
what I have to say...

317
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,797
your marriage will be all
peaches and cream again.

318
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:45,661
I hate peaches.
I hate cream.

319
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,395
You both got jobs at the shipyard.
You worked side by side.

320
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,941
And you both wore welding masks, so
you weren't known to each other.

321
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,569
Herman didn't know
who I was...

322
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,444
so he thought he was
flirting with somebody else.

323
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,539
Flirt, flirt,
flirt, flirt, flirt.

324
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:06,219
Now wait a minute. You were unknown
to each other, but still attracted.

325
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,654
Underneath, there was still
that spark of romance.

326
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:13,184
Even under the masks, you knew
you were made for each other.

327
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,434
You two fell in love with each other
all over again. Sight unseen.

328
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,096
And do you know
what day it is?

329
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,344
Happy anniversary,
Lily.

330
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,283
Happy anniversary,
Hermie.

331
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,086
To think that you were working
down at those shipyards...

332
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,920
just to buy me a present.

333
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,125
And to think that you were working
down there to buy me one.

334
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,728
And now we both
got fired...

335
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:53,733
and we have nothing. Oh, yes, we do.
We have each other.

336
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,133
Isn't that neat?
Isn't that touching?

337
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,436
Isn't that romantic?

338
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,574
<i>Isn't that sickening?</i>

339
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,049
[sawing]
