Grandpa, this isn't
going to hurt, is it?

2
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,452
I told you, Herman...

3
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:55,694
I've done it a hundred times to you
before and it never bothered you.

00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,066
You're just nervous 'cause
I ran out of anesthetic.

off, it's got to come off.

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,105

off the top and trim the sides.

do that, Son...

when Grandpa is giving me
a haircut.

14
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,871
He might snip my bangs and
spoil my Steve McQueen image.

15
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,768
I'm sorry, Pop.

16
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,114
I just want to show you
this pamphlet.

17
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:46,275
The whole town is having
Frontier Days this weekend.

18
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,376
Yes, I read about that
in the newspaper.

19
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,422
They're having a parade,
rodeo and contests.

20
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,823
And all the people are dressing
themselves up as pioneers and cowboys.

21
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,121
It's all set, Pop.

22
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:59,391
I entered your name
in the bucking bronco contest.

23
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,724
Bucking bronco contest?
Sure.

24
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,735
I'm gonna be
so proud of you, Pop.

25
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,135
I've been telling all the guys
around the rodeo...

26
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,434
that you're the greatest rider
in the world.

27
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,339
Well, shuckies.

28
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,935
That was
right smart of you, partner.

29
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,372
[laughing]

30
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,879
Grandpa.

31
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,680
[grunts]

32
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:25,883
Hank, it looks like...

33
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,551
we've got some pretty safe entries
in the bronco busting event.

34
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,923
They're all amateurs.

35
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,930
But I am a little concerned about
this fella, Herman Munster.

36
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,021
Yeah.

37
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,466
He's the guy whose kid was here bragging
about what a great rider his pop is.

38
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,696
That's right.

39
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,068
And we can't take any chances
of anybody...

40
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:44,472
walking off with that $500
prize money we're offering.

41
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,875
So just to be
on the safe side...

42
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,907
let's put this Munster
character on Volcano.

43
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,176
Volcano? That's not a
horse, it's a time bomb.

44
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,083
He'll wreck this guy Munster.

45
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,622
So what? If anything
should go wrong...

46
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,420
we'll return his entry fee
to his widow.

47
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,186
Herman...

48
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,527
you on a bucking bronco?

49
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,288
Why, you couldn't even ride
a kiddie car.

50
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,831
Yes, I could.

51
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,656
I used to ride Eddie's
all the time.

52
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,760
But, Uncle Herman,
riding a bucking bronco...

53
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,534
is one of the most dangerous
sports in the whole world.

54
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,404
You might get killed.

55
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:29,140
Herman, it'd be just like you to pull a
dirty trick like that on me, you bum.

56
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:32,805
You don't even have enough life
insurance to keep me in cigars.

57
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:36,479
Golly, when Eddie first mentioned
the idea of bronco busting to me...

58
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,045
it sounded kind of like
a fun thing.

59
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:43,089
But, dear, the last time you were
on a merry-go-round horse...

60
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,356
you had to wear
a safety belt.

61
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:49,499
I don't want you to go through with this.
You'll just go out and get yourself killed.

62
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,967
You're only 152 years old.

63
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:55,302
And I won't have you cut down
in the prime of life.

64
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,774
Gee, dear, I promised Eddie.
He's counting on me.

65
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,505
What can I say to him?
It's simple.

66
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,910
You just go up
to your son...

67
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,007
and tell him that his daddy
is a no-good, rotten coward.

68
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,551
I can't do that.

69
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:11,885
Boys don't have many heroes left
that they can look up to these days.

70
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,424
If I let him down, all he has
left is Smokey the Bear.

71
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:19,963
Herman, why don't you use
child psychology?

72
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,958
All you have to do is talk
to Eddie in such a way...

73
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:28,028
that he'll be the one who suggests
that you drop out of the rodeo.

74
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,575
That's a good idea.
That's just what I'll do.

75
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:37,104
But instead of being blunt and
direct, I'll be subtle...

76
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:40,743
and talk to Eddie
on his own mental level.

77
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:45,287
Yeah. And if you can't quite get
up to it, do the best you can.

78
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:48,948
[laughing]

79
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,226
[snarling]

80
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:58,195
And once upon a time,
in this big, big castle...

81
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,262
there lived this
very brave knight...

82
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,701
named Sir Herman the Great.

83
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,175
Gee, Pop, he had
the same name as you.

84
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,508
Well, well,
what do you know about that?

85
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,447
Anyway, in a nearby cave...

86
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,651
there lived this very mean,
mean dragon.

87
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,249
What did he do
that was so bad?

88
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,791
Well, he went around
abducting young maidens...

89
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:24,420
and pillaging the countryside
and terrorizing villages...

90
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,856
and doing
other naughty things.

91
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,423
And everyone said that Sir Herman
the Great was the only one...

92
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,336
that was brave enough and strong
enough to vanquish the dragon.

93
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,033
There's a white knight
on television like that.

94
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:40,509
Except, all he ever does is
chase dirt out of blue jeans.

95
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:44,139
Anyway, as Sir Herman the Great
was starting out on his way...

96
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,275
to vanquish the dragon, his
wife and his father-in-law...

97
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,911
and his niece
came running out and cried:

98
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:53,480
"O brave Sir Herman, prithee
do not go forth this day...

99
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,990
for the dragon
might slay thee."

100
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,025
Boy, they sure talked corny
in those days.

101
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,621
Well, anyway...

102
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:04,699
although Sir Herman was on his
way to slay the cruel dragon...

103
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,870
he thought it over
and realized...

104
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,768
that he could be eaten up
by the dragon.

105
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,636
And if the dragon
ate him up...

106
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,110
then there would be
no one left...

107
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,547
to take care of his little
home and his little family.

108
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,184
Now, what do you think
about that?

109
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,180
I think the knight was a rotten,
chicken, yellow coward.

110
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,649
Oh.

111
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,862
You do, huh?
Yeah.

112
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,992
I think you ought to sue the
guy who made up that story...

113
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,194
for calling the knight
by your name.

114
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,602
For you'd never chicken out like that.
Would you, Pop?

115
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,163
Gadzooks, no.

116
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,040
I bet tomorrow you'll be the
bravest guy in the whole rodeo.

117
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,943
Yeah, sure.

118
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,042
Well, good night, Son.

119
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,776
Goodnight, Pop.

You still think...

00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,388
we ought to put this
Munster guy in that horse?

129
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,898
Sure, why not?

130
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,127
But tell
the ambulance attendants...

131
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,330
that the minute he hits the ground,
to throw a sheet over him quick.

is Uncle Herman going to ride
that bronco in the rodeo today?

Yes, Marilyn.

I did everything I could
to talk him out of it.

a knight should be proud...

to ride forth
and slay dragons for his son.

Where's Uncle Herman now?
Down in the dungeon.

He is so nervous and so tense.

153
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:59,140
He asked Grandpa to do
something to relax his nerves.

That is a good idea.

I just hope
he doesn't overdo it.

Grandpa relaxed him...

his nerves were so loose...

00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,814
that we had to call in a piano
tuner to tighten them up.

159
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:15,890
Grandpa, have you found
anything yet to make me brave?

160
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,562
When I think of riding a
bucking bronco, I'm petrified.

161
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:22,928
What are you knocking? Some of
my best friends are petrified.

162
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,366
No, I mean scared.

163
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:27,302
Haven't you got
any brave pills I can take?

164
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:28,933
Well...

165
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:33,236
I made these in the Middle Ages
for Richard the Lion-Hearted.

166
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,805
Did they work?
Did they work?

167
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:40,476
I'll have you know that before he took
these, he was known as Chicken Dickie.

168
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,514
Shall I take some of these?
No.

169
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,147
It says they're good only if
you're going on a crusade...

170
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:50,558
and I don't think you wanna take
that much time off from work.

171
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,926
Grandpa, you gotta give me
something to make me a hero.

172
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,626
I got to ride that horse in an hour.
Herman, let's face it.

173
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,598
A nice, handsome,
pleasant man you are...

174
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:03,195
but with all the pills in the
world, a hero you ain't.

175
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,638
What am I going to do?

176
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:06,870
[snaps fingers]

177
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,378
It just came to me. Herman...

178
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:14,240
now, supposing the horse you rode
today was gentle and kind...

179
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,447
and you and he had sort of...

180
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,751
an under-the-table deal.

181
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,724
That's fine, but I'm not very
proficient at talking to horses.

182
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,094
You're very proficient
at talking to me, aren't you?

183
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:31,599
Yeah. Supposing I turn
myself into a horse.

184
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:37,472
You mean you would be the bucking
bronco I'd ride at the rodeo?

185
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,606
Grandpa, that's a wizard idea.

No.

191
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,694
What's the matter?

192
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:02,221
This animal bottle is so old,
the label has fallen off.

193
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:05,792
Well, I'll just have to
take my chances...

194
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,029
and hope I come up
with a horse.

195
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,801
Mom, where's Pop?

196
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,875
It's time to leave for the rodeo
and we don't wanna be late.

197
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,847
He's still down
in the dungeon with Grandpa.

198
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:22,519
I hope they're not making up another
batch of Dad's old-fashioned plasma.

199
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,621
Now, Eddie, don't get impatient.
I'm sure--

[goat bleating]

201
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,723
Aunt Lily, I could have
sworn I heard a goat.

202
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,258
So did I.

203
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,394
We're getting so nervous that
we're starting to hear things.

204
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:38,863

205

Grandpa.

206
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,905
You must've taken the wrong pill.
You're not a horse, you're a goat.

207
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,876
I can tell because
horses don't have horns.

208
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,543
Don't just sit there, Herman.
Give me another pill.

209
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,074
Yeah.

210
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,314
[Grandpa bleating]

[squealing]

214
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:14,702
Well, Grandpa, that's no good. I
can't ride a skunk in a rodeo.

215
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,374
Shut up and try another pill
before I let you have it.

216
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,239
Listen.

[Pig grunting]

218
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,116
Now I can swear
I hear a pig grunting.

219
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,050
A pig?

220
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:37,658
You don't suppose they're having a
barbecue at a time like this, do you?

221
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,201
Grandpa. Herman.

222
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,298
You'll be late for the rodeo.

223
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,971
(Herman)
We'll be right with you, Lily.

224
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,168
Grandpa, now look
what you've done.

225
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,878
You've gone and made
a pig of yourself.

226
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,415

Iask you...

231
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,428
is this a horse,
or is this a horse?

232
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:21,866
Grandpa.

233
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,676
[coughing]

234
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,788
Howdy, folks?
I'm all ready for the rodeo.

235
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,414
Gee, Pop, you look neat.

236
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,619
Just like the cowboys
in that cigarette commercial.

237
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:44,990
Thank you, Son.

238
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,462
Herman, please call this off.

239
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,193
If you get up
on a bucking bronco...

240
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,931
you'll just make a fool of
yourself and probably get killed.

241
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,473
You don't know anything
about being a cowboy.

242
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,134
Shucks.
What you talking about, ma'am?

243
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,233
I'm a rooting, tooting...

00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,591
Marilyn.

249
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:26,030
Eddie, can you help your father pry
himself loose from his drawers?

250
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,345
Thank you.

251
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,981
I guess John Wayne and those
other fellows must...

252
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,281
grease their thumbs
before they try that.

253
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,413
I guess if we're going,
we better get started.

254
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:46,649
Where's Grandpa?

255
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,852
Grandpa just had a few things
he wanted to take care of...

256
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,020
and he'll meet us
at the rodeo.

257
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,657
You think you'll have any trouble
with that wild mustang, Pop?

258
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,223
I don't think so, Son.

259
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:01,431
I'm gonna handle that critter like
he was a member of my own family.

It certainly was nice of Uncle
Herman to get us this private box.

262
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,923
Well, we Munsters always
feel more at home in a box.

00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,529
Boy, look at that guy.

264
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,868

really flipped him.

00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,648
Yes, I've never seen
that trick before.

Gee, I wonder where Pop is. The
bronco busting comes up next.

gets busted and not your father.

Everybody's checked in for the bronco
busting but that Munster character.

00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,036
Maybe he heard he was riding
Volcano and pulled up stakes.

00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,634
I wouldn't blame him.

Hiya, Munster.

00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,378
Will you look at that guy?

281
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,515
He's tall in the saddle
and he ain't even on a horse.

282
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,887
Get a load of that face.

283
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,052
He must've gone
through a buffalo stampede.

284
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:34,097
I didn't think there were that
many buffalo left in America.

285
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,463
Excuse me, but I was wondering
if you could tell me...

286
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,263
what chute
I'm supposed to come out of?

287
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,963
Come out of Chute 4.
Number 4.

288
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,628
Thank you very much.

289
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,731
I'll be ready and waiting.

290
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:51,778
We better not put Volcano in that
chute until the last minute.

291
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,717
If Munster gets a look at that local mustang,
he'll know we pulled a ringer on him.

Never mind, Herman.
What's the scoop?

303
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:28,641
I'll be coming out of Chute Number 4.
Now, make sure and be there.
