1
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,170
Uh, Igor?
[Squeaking]

2
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,801
Igor? Igor, will you
hold this a second?

3
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:38,144
Dropped it again.
Butterclaws.

4
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:41,944
[Sneeze]

5
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:54,861
[Chuckles]
Are you feeling
any better, Herman?

6
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:58,098
Well, uh, uh,
my headache's gone.

7
00:00:58,171 --> 00:01:00,503
But my sinuses are killing me.

8
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:04,806
Oh, and, uh, Grandpa.
This draft down here isn't
helping any either.

9
00:01:04,878 --> 00:01:09,076
[Laughs]
Don't be ridiculous!

10
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:13,643
How can there be a draft
25 feet underground?

11
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,518
Mr. Pike, this is the property
in question right here.

12
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,922
Belongs to a family
named Munster.

13
00:01:18,992 --> 00:01:21,460
They're some kind of holdout.

14
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:26,625
Well, we've only got 60 feet to go
for the two pipelines to connect.

15
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,364
Juncture-wise, that is.
So, Harkness, get somebody over there
to secure the right-of-way.

16
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,340
Well, we sentJohnson over, B.T.,
but, uh, he didn't come back.

17
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:37,468
Well, get him on the phone!

18
00:01:37,544 --> 00:01:42,811
I tried to, B.T., but the doctor
at the sanitarium said there are
no phones in the padded rooms.

19
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:46,451
That's what you get
for hiring a neurotic.

20
00:01:47,554 --> 00:01:50,887
If I don't get this pipeline
completed on schedule,

21
00:01:50,957 --> 00:01:54,154
the mayor and the city council are
going to have my head on a platter.

22
00:01:54,227 --> 00:01:57,424
I'll tell you what you do:
Put the pipeline under
the Munster's house.

23
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:59,431
We don't even need
to tell 'em about it.

24
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:02,059
Go down about 25 feet.
That should do it.

25
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:04,626
I don't know, B.T.
We could be in trouble.

26
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:07,969
Borden T. Pike laughs at trouble.

27
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:12,569
[Forced Laughing]
I don't intend to be intimidated
by the Munsters.

28
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:16,377
Besides, what kind of trouble would
we run into 25 feet underground?

29
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:34,723
Uh, that stuff you gave me yesterday
didn't work at all.

30
00:03:34,794 --> 00:03:37,763
Uh, have you got
any-anything else?

31
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:42,662
I'll be right...
[Creaking]

32
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:45,296
Back!

33
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:48,136
Stay right here.
Don't go 'way!

34
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:54,774
Now, now, now.

35
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:57,373
Where did I put that stuff?

36
00:03:58,718 --> 00:04:01,881
No, no, no, no. That's not
what I'm looking for.

37
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:06,551
And besides, I thought I told you
to wait in the washing machine!

38
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:08,753
Uh, this isn't gonna hurt, is it?

39
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:12,855
[Cackling]
Don't be such a baby, Herman.

40
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:16,597
?? [Humming]

41
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:21,336
[Gurgling]

42
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:26,635
Ahh!

43
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:32,043
?? [Continues]

44
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:37,056
[Liquid Sloshing]

45
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:44,894
?? [Hums]
[Sloshes]

46
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:25,403
And you expect me to believe
a ridiculous story like that?

47
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:27,565
Horrible creatures,
bats flying around...

48
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:29,768
Scare tactics, pure and simple.

49
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:33,210
They tried tojack up the price by
putting on those ridiculous disguises.

50
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,272
Well, I know it-it sounds ridiculous,
but that's the way this fellow
reported the story to me.

51
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,184
Nonsense. He just doesn't want
to assume the responsibility for
having broken into that cellar.

52
00:05:41,254 --> 00:05:45,953
But sir, we never expected
anyone to have a cellar that deep.

53
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:49,757
No excuses. Now, get out of here.
And don't come back
until you get a haircut.

54
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:52,354
Yes, sir.

55
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:55,993
All right, Harkness.
I'll handle this myself.

56
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:59,368
Fanny, dear, I called to tell you that
I won't be home for supper tonight.

57
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,340
I have a very important
business engagement across town.

58
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:05,606
All right.
Who is she?

59
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:08,671
Fanny, I'm not seeing a woman.

60
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:12,514
Yes, I did have lunch with a woman.
It was my mother!

61
00:06:12,585 --> 00:06:16,453
Fanny, stop being so jealous. I can't
help it if my mother was a woman.

62
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:20,349
It could happen to anybody!

63
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:23,793
All right. I'll speak to her about it.

64
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:27,859
[Rapid, High-pitched Babbling]
Yes, dear.

65
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:30,368
[Babbling Continues]
Yes, dear.

66
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:33,304
[Continues]
Yes, dear!

67
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:37,673
I'll show those Munsters that
Borden T. Pike will not be intimidated.

68
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:44,315
[Wolf Howling]

[Banging, Echoing]

[Snarling]
Spotty. Get away
from the door! Get away!

71
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:04,001
Eddie! Come and get Spot and
put him in the kitchen this instant!

72
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:10,871
I'm terribly sorry, but Spotty gets
so excited when we have visitors.

73
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:15,847
Won't you come in?
I'll come in, but remember...
I'm not easily taken in.

74
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:31,862
May I have your hat, Mr., uh...
Pike. Borden T. Pike.
City Gas.

75
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:33,922
Come right in, Mr. Pike.

76
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:41,035
I'm Herman Munster.
This is my father-in-law, the Count.

77
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:47,746
It's a pleasure to meet you.

78
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:50,681
Uh, won't you have a seat?

79
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,850
[Pike] Now, we realized
you were inconvenienced.

80
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:02,622
We're prepared to compensate you
for the damage... Why, hello...

81
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:07,157
...there.

82
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:09,326
For the damage done
to your basement.

83
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:13,668
In addition to which, we will pay you,
uh, fifteen... [Grunting]

84
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,370
Uh, $1,500 for the continuance of
the right-of-way through your property.

85
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:20,639
That is my final offer.

86
00:08:20,713 --> 00:08:23,807
$1,500!

87
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:26,579
That would come in very handy
for a sunny day.

88
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:29,178
Boy, how much is that in cheese?

89
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:34,022
Uh, Eddie. You've been told before.
Don't play with that mousetrap.

90
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:36,618
The mice will never
go near it now.

91
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:39,529
Uh, well, Mr. Pike.
It sounds like a good deal to me.

92
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,965
Oh, good.
I'm against it.

93
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:45,801
The idea of sneaking a gas main
under our property.

94
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:51,307
Thank you.

95
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:54,706
I urge you
to accept my offer.

96
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:57,079
It will be good for
your neighbors and friends.

97
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,244
The entire community will
benefit from the pipeline.

98
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,121
Well, l-I would say, if it's good for
the community, we have to accept.

99
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:08,024
I think we should take Herman's advice.

100
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:12,030
After all, he's always been
the levelheaded one of the family.

101
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:15,598
I want no part of it.

102
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:19,365
I don't like the idea of anybody
digging on the premises.

103
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:21,907
There's no telling
who they'll come up with.

104
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,112
I urge you to accept my offer.
And don't think you're gonna
get me to raise it,

105
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:33,118
because I don't scare easy.

106
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:36,246
[Stammers]
Mr. Pike. Wait.

107
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:41,851
This is my house,
and it's gonna be my way.

108
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:44,897
Uh, l-I agree with Lily.
We accept.

109
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:48,593
Eddie. My boy.

110
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:52,434
I want you to be a witness
to my degradation.

111
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:56,737
Now someday, you'll have
creatures of your own.

112
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:59,676
You'll know what to expect.

This is what you want?
This is what you'll get.

116
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:12,358
If you want me,
I'll be in my room.

Uh, you'll have to
excuse Grandpa, Mr. Pike.

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,504
You know how old people...

Ow! Boy.

128
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:49,652
I told him to keep
his big trap shut.

Eddie!

130

I don't care what
Grandpa says.

131
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:02,466
I'm gonna go
call Mr. Pike right now
and tell him we accept.

132
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:05,170
After all, we can't always
think of ourselves.

133
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:07,940
W-We have to think
of our neighbors too.

134
00:11:08,014 --> 00:11:11,848
Herman, you certainly have
a good heart.

135
00:11:11,918 --> 00:11:14,318
Best money can buy.

136

Hello.

Uh, Mr. Munster?
[Chuckles]
Yes, this is Mr. Pike.

140
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:49,314
Oh, oh, Mr. Pike.
You left in such a hurry.
We didn't finish the deal.

141
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:53,155
If you like, I can drop over
right now, sign the papers,
and pick up the check.

142
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:57,663
No, no, don't do that!
I'll-I'll have my secretary
m-mail it to you tomorrow.

on the telephone?

of your girlfriends?
No, it's a business call!

On, uh, second thought, Mr. Munster,
it might be a good idea for you
to drop over this evening.

00:12:10,376 --> 00:12:12,867
I'd like my wife to meet you.

Yes. I know where.

Oh, just a headstone's throw
from here.

149

Be right over. Bye now.

Oh, come on. Ow!
That hurts!

Stop it.
There. That's a good boy.

Now, Herman, I don't want you
going out. You've already had
a sinus attack today.

153
00:12:47,346 --> 00:12:51,077
And you're not looking well.
Ooh, you've even got color
in your cheeks.

154
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,278
Really? Oh. Well, um,
maybe you're right.

155
00:12:54,353 --> 00:12:56,844
L... My sinuses have
been acting up.

156
00:12:56,923 --> 00:13:00,950
Well, they were probably
worn out when you got them.

157
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:04,554
Grandpa! Are you going to hang
around here sulking all night?

158
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:10,096
Why don't you go to your room?
Hmm! Why should I?

159
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:13,070
Anyplace I hang myself
is home.

160
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:17,901
Hi, Grandpa.
Oh, Marilyn.

161
00:13:17,977 --> 00:13:20,309
I'm so glad you're here.
Would you mind going on...

162
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:22,472
an errand for us, to Mr. Pike's?

163
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:26,951
- I'd be happy to.
- Oh, and be sure to introduce
yourself to his wife.

164
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:28,953
Uh, Mr. Pike said he'd like us
to meet her.

165
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:33,481
And be warm and friendly.
It always pays off.

166
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:47,837
The idea. A man your age
carrying on like that.

167
00:13:47,907 --> 00:13:51,206
Anything you say, dear.
And don't "dear" me!

168
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:53,336
As soon as you do,
I know you're up to something.

169
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:57,007
Really, Borden, after all these years
of marriage, you'd think you know
where your place is by this time.

170
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,950
And as far as I'm concerned...
[Doorbell Chimes]

171
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:02,317
I'll get the door, dear.
Don't you bother.
Don't you bother.

172
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:06,324
I'll get the door.
Fanny, dear, I think you'd better
let me get the door.

173
00:14:06,392 --> 00:14:09,020
[Chuckles]
We'll just see about that!

174
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:22,937
I'm Marilyn Munster.
Well. I just happen to be
Mrs. Pike.

175
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:27,571
I'm here for the money.
Your husband knows
what it's for.

176
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:30,115
You horrible creature!

177
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:38,115
Well, what did you think of that?

178
00:14:40,092 --> 00:14:42,856
[Crashes]
Well! What did you
think of that?

179
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:52,471
Now are you going to listen to me?
Oh, how I would like to boil
that Mr. Pike in oil!

180
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:56,668
But no. You had to give away
my cookbook to the Goodwill.

181
00:14:56,742 --> 00:15:00,007
Okay. Okay.
Don't worry about it.

182
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,014
I'll handle this myself.
The nerve of those people.

183
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:05,516
It makes me furious!

184
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:08,710
Herman, don't lose your head.

185
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,288
I'm-I'm gonna go call
that Mr. Pike right now!

186
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:18,321
That's right, dear.
Don't be afraid.

187
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:21,366
You just show him
who you're made of!

188
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:24,631
[Dialing]

189
00:15:28,674 --> 00:15:32,075
Pike? This is Herman Munster.

190
00:15:32,144 --> 00:15:36,080
Never mind that.
You can't treat my niece
that way!

191
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:38,742
Oh, yeah? Usually,
I'm not a violent man.

192
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:41,753
But I'm coming over there right now
and punch you in the nose.

193
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:51,121
Fanny? Fa...

194
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:56,932
Fanny!
Yes?

195
00:15:57,003 --> 00:15:59,233
Who was that at the door
a few minutes ago?

196
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:01,637
Huh! As if you didn't know!

197
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:06,770
It's that snippy little blonde
of yours, that Marilyn Munster,
or whatever her name is.

198
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:08,780
Oh, that's what he meant!

199
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:11,817
Her uncle is on his way here now.
He's...

200
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:14,910
We-Well, he's indescribable!
You'll have to leave immediately.

201
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:18,013
I'll stay here
and defend our home.
Oh!

202
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,354
I get the picture.

203
00:16:20,426 --> 00:16:23,224
Really, Borden, you're not about
to use child psychology on me again.

204
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:25,423
No!
You can't get rid of me that way.

205
00:16:25,498 --> 00:16:28,763
Obviously that little blonde creature
is on her way here right now.

206
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:32,497
No, it's her uncle.!
Well, don't think I'm gonna make it
easy for the two of you.

207
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:34,766
I'm not about to! And if there's
any home defending to do,

208
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,774
you can be sure
I'm gonna do it!

209
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:38,742
[Door Chimes]
It's him!
It's her.

Now, you stop that laughing, Eddie.
I can't help it.

213
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:12,304
Daddy looks so funny with
that thing on his nose!

214
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:15,779
Never mind that.
Now you just finish your breakfast,

215
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:19,477
and you'd better start dawdling,
or you're going to be on time for school!

216
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:25,451
As I was saying, before I was
so rudely interrupted,

217
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:27,515
when Mr. Pike...
Morning, folks!

218
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:29,686
Morning.
Good morning.
[Eddie] Morning.

219
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:36,226
- Oh, isn't this a beautiful day!
- Thank you!

220
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:42,233
Does anybody mind if
I continue with my story?

221
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:44,469
Not while I'm eating.

222
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:48,309
All right. I won't tell you
what happened!

223
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:51,817
[Scoffs]
Please, Herman, dear.
Do tell us what happened.

224
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,910
All right.

225
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,624
When Mr. Pike came out
and saw his wife lying on the floor,

226
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:03,685
he thought I hit her!

227
00:18:03,763 --> 00:18:06,891
- He punched me in the nose.
- Oh, you poor dear!

228
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:10,026
Ooh! Ooh!
Well, oh, one thing though.

229
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:12,161
I think it cured my sinus.

230

[Loud Banging On Door]
I'll get it.

- Truce!
- Truce.

233
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:46,594
Oh, dear, it stopped raining.
I'm afraid the weather's
turning bad.

234
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:49,699
Uh, I came to apologize.

235
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:53,973
You see, when your niece came
to my house, my wife was expecting
someone else who,

236
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:56,037
uh, never showed up.

237
00:18:56,115 --> 00:19:00,074
That's all right, Mr. Pike.
I can understand it.

238
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:02,586
It happens to me a lot too.

239
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:06,091
I'm-I'm sorry I hit you.
I'm not ordinarily a violent man, but...

240
00:19:06,158 --> 00:19:08,626
when I saw my wife lying there, l-l-l...

241
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:10,787
Oh, uh, lost your head?

in the deal, I brought a check
for the amount that we agreed upon.

if you'll just sign the contract.

with your signature, he'll have my head!

get away with this!

- We can't possibly keep the money.

300
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:17,040
I mean... Well, we just can't
take money for helping people.

301
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:21,478
I guess you're right as usual, Lily.
It's like taking blood money.

302
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:25,379
Don't try to cheer me up.
I feel bad enough.

303
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:30,548
- What do you mean?
- My pen...

304
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:32,817
was filled with disappearing ink.

305
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:47,031
I just can't seem to get
the right wavelength.

306
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:49,666
Grandpa, that crystal ball
doesn't work anymore.

307
00:23:49,742 --> 00:23:52,404
All you ever get are
the reruns of My Little Margie.

308
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:56,977
I got it! I got it! I got it!

309
00:23:59,318 --> 00:24:01,286
Pike, you're a disgrace!

310
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:04,049
Men like you give gas
a bad name!

311
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:08,355
But, Your Honor, I saw
Mr. Munster sign that
with my own eyes!

312
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:12,625
L-I don't understand...
Pike, I suggest you resign
and give up drinking.

313
00:24:12,698 --> 00:24:14,689
In that order!

314
00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:38,848
Grandpa, how did you do that?

315
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:41,222
I guess it's just in his blood!

316
00:24:41,293 --> 00:24:44,023
I'll drink to that!
