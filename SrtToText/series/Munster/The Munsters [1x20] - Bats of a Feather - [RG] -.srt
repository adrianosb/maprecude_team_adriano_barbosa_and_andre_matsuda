1
00:00:02,382 --> 00:00:07,149
But I tell you, Herman.
If it has to be a pet,
our cat would be ideal.

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,518
Lily, you're just being stubborn.

3
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:14,151
If Eddie is going to enter
anything at the school pet fair,
Spot is just the animal.

4
00:00:14,227 --> 00:00:16,354
He's a typical boy's pet.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,024
Oh, Spot. There's nothing
clever about him.

6
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:22,330
Just tell me one thing
he can do besides chase trains.

7
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:25,599
Well, let's put it
up to Grandpa. Grandpa,

8
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:29,608
uh, which one of our pets
do you think Eddie should take
to the pet fair playground?

9
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:31,268
There's no question about it.

10
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:33,210
Our cat.
Or Spot?

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,111
Neither. Igor.

12
00:00:35,182 --> 00:00:37,047
Igor? A bat?

13
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:41,383
Certainly. Didn't Eddie say
that one of the prizes
was for intelligence?

14
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:45,482
[Chuckles]
Does that Spot have sense enough
to hang from the rafters by his toes?

15
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:49,051
Can that cat fly down
to the corner store
for the evening newspaper?

16
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:51,063
Spot must be intelligent.

17
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:54,259
L-lf not, why isn't he extinct
like the rest of his species?

18
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:59,328
But don't forget, Herman.
One of the things they judge
the children's pets on is good grooming.

19
00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:05,345
Spot can win that too.
I told Eddie to work on him
and make him look his very best.

20
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:09,610
Hey, Dad. I don't think Spot
wants to be entered
in the school fair.

21
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:11,981
He's hiding under the stairs
and won't come out.

22
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:15,852
- Now, Eddie, please.
- Can't you do something,
Uncle Herman?

23
00:01:15,922 --> 00:01:20,154
- Marilyn...
- Will you forget about Spot?
He's nothing but a big, stupid baby.

24
00:01:20,227 --> 00:01:24,630
- Just a minute, Grandpa.
- Yes. Now, wait a minute, everybody.

25
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:27,929
You can handle this, Herman dear.
You coax him out.

26
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:30,993
You all seem to be forgetting.
I have a way with animals.

27
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:33,062
Hmm.

28
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:37,505
Come on, Spot.
Come on out, Spot.

29
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:39,636
[Growls]
Come on, Spot.
Be a good boy.

30
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:43,181
- This is your Uncle Hermie.
- [Growls]

31
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:47,248
Now, Spot, come on out of there.

32
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,017
Come on out of there.
Spot, you're being a very bad boy.

33
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:54,754
You want to go to
the school pet fair with Eddie,
don't you? Poopsy?

34
00:01:54,828 --> 00:01:56,819
[Roars]

35
00:01:58,298 --> 00:02:02,598
Well, I guess he seems to be
a little bit reluctant.

36
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:05,968
But, gee, I gotta have
a pet to take to school.

37
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:08,269
Eddie, if we leave
Spot alone for a while,

38
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:11,606
sooner or later
he'll get hungry and come out
looking for somebody.

39
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:22,112
Herman, I don't care what you do.

40
00:03:22,182 --> 00:03:25,743
You'll never be able to get Spot
to behave himself in school.

41
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:30,450
Eddie, I still think
you should take our cat.

42
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:33,015
But, gee,
he couldn't win anything.

43
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:35,459
He's just a plain, old
everyday house cat.

44
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:38,464
- [Roars]
- Well, I guess you're right.

45
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:43,060
In my opinion, Eddie,
you ought to take Igor
to the pet fair.

46
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:46,902
Oh, that bat
is the most beautiful
thing that flies.

47
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:51,171
Well, okay,
now that I think of it,
Igor would be good.

48
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:53,906
He'd be smaller.

49
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,246
How do we know he'll go for this?
You know what happened that time
we took him duck hunting.

50
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,845
That was terrible.
He tried to fly south
with that flock of mallards.

51
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:06,052
Six weeks later,
he came walking home
with his wings full of buckshot.

52
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:10,290
Good morning, Eddie, Grandpa.
[Chuckles]

53
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:12,331
Man, am I excited.

54
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:16,927
I bet I'll be the only kid
with a real, live, honest-to-goodness
Transylvanian bat.

55
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:20,962
Well, as long as we couldn't
talk Spot into entering,

56
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,238
I guess we'll have to settle
for this silly fly-by-night.

57
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:26,302
[Squeaking]

58
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:28,370
You big dummy!

59
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,915
Igor, come back!

60
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:35,020
Goodness me.
What happened to him?

61
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:39,115
Wh-What happened to him?
You insulted him.
That's what happened to him.

62
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:43,895
Igor. Mom! Mom!

63
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:46,762
[Squeaking]

64
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,028
Mom.! Mom.!

65
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:52,503
There he goes.
Oh, Eddie,
what's the matter?

66
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:56,201
Pop said mean things about Igor,
and he ran away.

67
00:04:56,276 --> 00:04:59,439
I can't be the only kid in school
without a pet for the fair.

68
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:01,810
Oh, don't blame
your father too much.

69
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:04,315
Igor's always throwing tantrums.

70
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:07,410
Sometimes I think he's nothing
but a spoiled bat.

71
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:09,648
I can't go to school today.

72
00:05:09,723 --> 00:05:12,021
All the kids are gonna
make fun of me.

73
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:20,066
Grandpa, I'm really
ashamed of myself.

74
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,658
I shouldn't have
opened my big mouth.

75
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:24,670
I let my boy down.

76
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:27,866
I'm a miserable excuse
for a father.

77
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:30,603
You know, Herman,
there's a lot of ham in you.

78
00:05:30,677 --> 00:05:33,475
Don't blame me.
They had to use
what was available.

79
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:38,110
Don't you worry, Herman.
Eddie will not be disappointed.

80
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:41,244
He's going to have a pet
to take to that fair.
[Chuckles]

81
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:44,256
In that case I'd like to
ask you one question.

82
00:05:44,324 --> 00:05:47,020
- What?
- Not what.

83
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:49,084
Who.

84
00:05:49,162 --> 00:05:52,188
Who?
Me. That's who.

85
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:04,566
[Squeaking]

86
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:08,737
[Laughing]

87
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,915
Grandpa, I have to admit it.

88
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:15,978
You're the greatest.

89
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:18,047
[Laughing]

90
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:21,823
Father, I am deeply touched.

91
00:06:21,895 --> 00:06:25,695
It's not every grandfather that would
do what you did for Eddie.
[Door Closes]

92
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:27,995
Shh. Here he comes now.

93
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:30,366
Oh. Here you go, son.

94
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:32,428
Now, handle it very carefully.

95
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:35,269
Igor isn't as young
as he used to be.

96
00:06:35,341 --> 00:06:37,673
Good luck, Eddie.
And bring home a blue ribbon.

97
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:40,770
I bet I win first prize
for the most intelligent pet.

98
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:43,145
Well, I wouldn't
count on that too much.

99
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:45,844
Igor isn't as intelligent
as he used to be either.

100
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,184
[Squeaking]
You better hurry now, dear.

101
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:57,655
Say, where's Grandpa?

102
00:06:57,731 --> 00:06:59,665
He's, uh, uh,

103
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,701
hung up in an experiment.

104
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:04,737
Uh, but he'll be with you
in spirit all the time.

105
00:07:04,804 --> 00:07:07,898
Now you be a good boy.
Okay. Come on, Igor.
Good-bye, everybody.

106
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:09,908
Good-bye.
[All]
Good-bye.

107
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:12,638
Good luck.
Good luck, both of you.

108
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:20,377
You know, there's only
one bad feature about this.

109
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:23,445
If Grandpa does win
over that bunch of
goldfish and hamsters,

110
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:25,514
there'll be no living with him.

111
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,629
Children, you've all brought
such interesting pets.

112
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:37,670
I'm sure your principal's going to
have trouble in choosing a winner.

113
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:40,501
Aren't you, Mr. Hazlett?
Yes, indeed, Miss Guthrie.

114
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:43,041
Oh, what lovely doves.

115
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:46,010
Johnny, that's just lovely.
Look at that squirrel.

116
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,138
Isn't he a cute little fellow?

117
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:50,205
Well, and what is it
we have here?

118
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:54,720
- It's me, Mr. Hazlett.
- No, Eddie. I mean in the cage.

119
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:57,086
Oh. It's my pet, Igor.

120
00:07:57,157 --> 00:07:59,284
[Squeaking]
Oh.

121
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:03,318
Why, it's a bat.
Boy, what a neat pet.

122
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:06,661
Hey, Eddie, does it catch rats?
Only when it feels like dancing.

123
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:09,725
That's very nice, Eddie.

124
00:08:09,803 --> 00:08:13,739
Uh, suppose you put the cover
back on the cage now.

125
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:17,402
But, gee, Mrs. Guthrie,
Igor hasn't done any of his tricks.

126
00:08:17,477 --> 00:08:20,674
Well, what kind of tricks
can he do?

127
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:23,614
My pet, Igor,
will fly out of his cage,

128
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:26,811
circle the room twice
and return back to his cage
on command.

129
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:28,877
Go, Igor.

130
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:30,946
Oh, my goodness.

131
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:33,857
[Children Laughing]

132
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:35,918
[Screams]

133
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:38,657
[Squeaking]

134
00:08:45,905 --> 00:08:48,669
Oh, I bet Eddie
is proud of his pet.

135
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:53,542
And I'm sure Grandpa is doing things
that Igor wouldn't have
the intelligence to think of.

136
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:56,741
I must say, I have to
take my hat off to Grandpa...

137
00:08:56,816 --> 00:09:00,183
for changing himself
into a bat for Eddie's sake.
[Chuckles]

138
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:03,586
I know I wouldn't like to
go out in public
looking grotesque.

139
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:07,854
But we don't want Grandpa
giving Eddie a false sense
of values...

140
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:10,225
by catering to his every whim.

141
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:14,130
Well, Eddie doesn't know it's Grandpa.
He thinks it's Igor.
[Door Closes]

142
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:17,862
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

143
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:21,065
Hello, Eddie.
Hi, son.

144
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,631
Well, how did you do
at the pet fair?

145
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,544
How would you like to look
at the prizewinner
for the most intelligent pet...

146
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:29,741
at Mockingbird Heights School?

147
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:32,182
Look.

148
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:34,015
[Squeaking]

149
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:41,250
Father, what have you done now?

150
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:44,594
[Chuckles]
Where's Igor?

151
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:48,327
Igor? Oh, I traded him off
to Timmy Brubaker for the squirrel.

152
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:50,392
Isn't he neat?
Oh!

153
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:55,272
Oh! Eddie, you naughty,
naughty boy.

154
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:58,504
You traded your grandfather
for a squirrel?

155
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:06,281
There, there, Aunt Lily.
Now don't you worry.

156
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:09,719
I'm real sorry, Mom,
but I didn't know it was Grandpa.

157
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:11,780
Anyway, we only traded
for the weekend.

158
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:13,849
I'm sure he'll be all right, Lily.

159
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:16,487
Sure. He'll be home in no time.

160
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:20,692
Boy, you should have seen him
flying after Miss Guthrie. Vroom!

161
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:23,827
Or he'll just change himself
back into his old self...

162
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:25,871
and walk home.
[Chuckles]

163
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:30,376
He can't change back to himself
in that small cage.
There's no room.

164
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:33,378
Oh, Herman,
what are we gonna do?

165
00:10:33,446 --> 00:10:37,576
I didn't live all these years to...
to end up as the daughter
of a squirrel.

166
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,847
I hope those Brubakers don't feed him
peanuts and popcorn.

167
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,047
They always give Grandpa heartburn.

168
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,152
No cause for concern. Eddie.

169
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:50,753
Yeah, Dad?
Why don't you go call
your little friend,

170
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,926
tell him the deal is off
and that he can have
his squirrel back for your bat.

171
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:57,026
Okay, Dad.

172
00:10:57,103 --> 00:11:00,129
Herman, don't you think
you better call the Brubakers?

173
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:02,436
No, dear.
It'll teach Eddie self-reliance...

174
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:07,468
and how to handle little problems
like this when they come up later on
in life with his own family.

175
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:11,847
Poor Grandpa.
He was only trying to do
the right thing.

176
00:11:11,918 --> 00:11:13,943
Come on.

177
00:11:14,988 --> 00:11:17,718
Hello? Mrs. Brubaker?
Is Timmy there?

178
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:21,956
Oh, well, this is Eddie Munster.
You probably don't remember me.

179
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:24,019
Oh, you do remember me.

180
00:11:24,097 --> 00:11:26,691
Gosh. I was only
over at your house once.

181
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:29,564
Well, I'm calling about the bat
I traded to Timmy today.

182
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:32,570
- You see, I have to
get it back. It's my grandfather.
- Eddie.

183
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:35,106
Don't tell them that.
They might jack up the price.

184
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:38,940
I mean, it's a...
a favorite of my grandmother's.

185
00:11:40,947 --> 00:11:44,474
Oh, it's not there.
Golly. They sold him.

186
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,714
- Sold him?
- Yeah. Timmy
sold him to his father for 65 cents.

187
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:51,279
And Mr. Brubaker took him down
to where he works.

188
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:54,485
Where? Where?
Ask her where he works.

189
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,551
Where does Mr. Brubaker work?

190
00:11:57,563 --> 00:11:59,963
Oh, that's nice.
He likes laboratories.

191
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:02,593
Oh, where is this laboratory?

192
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:06,463
Thanks a lot, Mrs. Brubaker.

193
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:09,235
Don't worry.
There's nothing that can
hurt Grandpa.

194
00:12:09,308 --> 00:12:12,835
Mr. Brubaker's a rocket expert
and works at a top secret space lab.

195
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:15,745
Oh. Well, that's simple.

196
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:18,375
We'll just go down to the lab
and pick him up.

197
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:20,385
Where is the lab, Eddie?

198
00:12:20,453 --> 00:12:21,715
Washington, D.C.

199
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:31,219
[Chittering]

200
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:44,710
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Doctor.

201
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:49,407
Yes, Bruba...
Here's a new customer
for our travel agency.

202
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:51,882
L... Just in time too, Brubaker.
Yes.

203
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:55,910
I brought him in on the plane with me
this morning. And guess what.
What?

204
00:12:55,988 --> 00:12:59,151
I bought him from my son
for 65 cents.

205
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:01,159
Sixty...
[Laughs]

206
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:03,388
Let's put him
over here, Brubaker.
Yes.

207
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:07,193
He certainly is
a woolly one, isn't he?
Yes.

208
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:09,496
I've always wanted to
send a bat into orbit.

209
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:12,094
[Squeaking]
Ah.
[Chuckles]

210
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:15,436
Listen to that.
It's almost as if he understood us.

211
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:17,738
He's so eager to go.

212
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:22,372
We've known for some time
that bats, uh, possess
some sort of radar.

213
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:26,817
Now we want to find out
if their signals can be picked up
by our own equipment.

214
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:30,322
Ah. We're going to
send this little fellow into orbit,

215
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:33,984
and then we'll track him
with our equipment.
Right.

216
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,621
You know what?
I think we'll send him up
on that Thermal 2...

217
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:40,257
that's, uh, scheduled to be
blasted off tomorrow morning.

218
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:44,463
Oh, but, Dr. Grant,
we haven't yet succeeded
in recovering a Thermal 2.

219
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:49,065
Oh, I know. But the, uh, success
of the experiment doesn't depend
on that particular bat.

220
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:51,133
We can always
get another one, you know.

221
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,201
Poor bat.

222
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,074
This is peculiar, Doctor.
What's that?

223
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,744
Have you ever known
a bat to faint?

224
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:04,721
ByJove, it is peculiar,
isn't it?

225
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:16,759
Herman, don't press your nose
against the glass.

226
00:14:16,836 --> 00:14:18,861
You'll get your face
all out of shape.

227
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:24,137
I'm sorry, Lily.
It's just that it's my first plane trip,
and I'm so excited.

228
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:27,737
[Laughs]
I'm worried about Grandpa.

229
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:30,839
Now, Lily, we'll be in Washington
in less than an hour.

230
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:33,681
Just settle back
and enjoy the trip the way I am.

231
00:14:33,753 --> 00:14:35,880
[Sighs]

232
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:39,984
Herman, what are you doing?
Lily,

233
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:42,527
Marilyn, Eddie...
everybody out.

234
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:44,529
The propellers!
The propellers are gone!

235
00:14:44,597 --> 00:14:48,124
Take it easy, Pop.
This is a jet plane.

236
00:14:51,804 --> 00:14:54,466
Oh.

237
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,531
Of course.

238
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:01,970
You know, there is
something strange, Lily.

239
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:05,745
Before we took off,
this airplane was filled with people.

240
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:09,982
As soon as we came on and sat down,
they all got up and left.

241
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:13,025
Well, l... I guess maybe
they just came
to see somebody off.

242
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:15,322
I wonder where the stewardess is.

243
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:17,658
She hasn't come near us
since we took off.

244
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:22,367
I think she's probably
new on the job
and a little nervous about flying.

245
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:26,895
Remember back at the airport
those two men had to shove her on
and slam the door behind her?

246
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,836
Hey, Pop.
Here comes the girl
with the food.

247
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:33,969
She's gotten over
her nervousness.

248
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:39,343
Miss, uh, uh, you're trembling.

249
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:43,616
Uh, if it's the fact
that there are no propellers,
uh, you needn't worry.

250
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:45,384
It's a jet.

251
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:49,084
Thank you.

252
00:15:55,134 --> 00:15:57,125
Slow down, Eddie.

253
00:15:57,203 --> 00:15:59,797
Don't bolt your food.
Okay.

254
00:16:02,408 --> 00:16:05,900
Herman, she didn't
bring us any salt.

255
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:07,912
Oh. I'll call her.

256
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,815
Uh, miss? Uh, stewardess,
would you bring the salt, please?

257
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,081
Here you are, sir.

258
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:26,724
Hmm. You know, Lily,

259
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,291
I don't think
that young lady has the stuff
to make a good stewardess.

260
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:42,538
Has that bat come to yet?
Hmm?

261
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:44,845
Has that bat come to yet?

262
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:47,147
Oh. No.

263
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:51,553
But I put something
in the cage next to him
that should bring him around...

264
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:53,615
a female bat.

265
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:55,684
Oh.

266
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:58,525
I thought they might as well
get used to one another.

267
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:01,361
I mean, after all,
tomorrow they blast off
together.

268
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:03,925
Oh, that's such a good idea.

269
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:06,972
Let's leave them alone.
Okay.

270
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,704
[Squeaking]

271
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:21,852
[Squeaking]

272
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:43,699
Hey, buddy,
you been here long?

273
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:46,506
Got here Tuesday.
You're new, aren't you?

274
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:48,513
Yeah, just pulled in today.

275
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:51,345
What goes on in there anyway?

276
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:55,581
From what I hear,
you just wouldn't believe
the weird things they build in there.

277
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:58,953
All kinds of kooky things
they send into outer space.

278
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:01,584
What do they look like?
Look like?

279
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,390
You don't think
they'd actually let us
see 'em, do ya?

280
00:18:04,463 --> 00:18:08,160
No, and I'm not sure
I want to anyway.
[Vehicle Approaching]

281
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:15,367
Well, here we are.

282
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:18,808
It's a shame we had to spend
all that money on a rented car.

283
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:21,506
It was impossible
to get a taxi at the airport.

284
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,174
I think the taxis are on strike.

285
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,983
When I hailed them,
some of the drivers abandoned their cabs
right in the middle of the street.

286
00:18:29,054 --> 00:18:31,682
Well, this is the space lab, Pop.

287
00:18:31,757 --> 00:18:33,748
But that signs says keep out.

288
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:36,351
And look at those guards.
So fierce-looking.

289
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:40,722
[Door Closes]

290
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:45,368
My gosh! So that's what
they're building in there.

291
00:18:45,438 --> 00:18:47,599
Yeah. One of them
must have got out.

292
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:50,665
They must have built it
to send to outer space.
Send out?

293
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:52,734
It looks more like something
they brought back.

294
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:58,415
Uh, pardon me.
You'd better get
right back in there, mister.

295
00:18:58,484 --> 00:19:01,317
Uh, m-master. Uh, sir.

296
00:19:01,387 --> 00:19:04,550
They'll be looking for you.
Inside? In the laboratory?

297
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:06,591
Right this way, please.

298
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:09,184
We're... We're your friends, you know.
Thank you.

Uh, you dogfaces are very polite.

300
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:18,896
See? See?
[Chuckles]

301
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:24,204
I told you. Your uncle can
charm the vultures out of the trees
when he wants to.

302
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:27,177
Are you sure we'll be able to accomplish
the experiment tomorrow?
Yes.

303
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:29,271
Excuse me.
Yes, please.

304
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:31,316
Uh, gentlemen...
Oh, dear.

305
00:19:31,383 --> 00:19:33,874
I do believe that you have a...
Uh, gentlemen?

306
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:35,921
Oh, my. Oh!

307
00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:37,649
No.

308
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:41,683
That's odd.

309
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,751
Well, genius.

310

[Squeaking]

00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:48,493
Oh. There you are, Grandpa.

312
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,558
Come along.
[Chuckles]

313
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:53,366
You've been
very, very, very, very naughty.

[Wheezing Laugh]
[Squeaking]

00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:19,923
Say, Brubaker. Not a scratch.

[Glass Particles Rattling On Floor]

318
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:28,400
That thing certainly
gave me a fright
walking in here like that.

319
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:32,103
Yes, but then I realize
that must be what Dr. Schweinhart
and his associates...

320
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:34,168
have been working on
in such secrecy.

321
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:37,215
He always gets
the most interesting projects.
Yes.

322
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:39,683
Oh, well.
We have our own work to do.
Right.

00:20:39,752 --> 00:20:41,777
Back to our bats.
Yes.

[Clears Throat]

325
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:45,980
I say, Brubaker,
one of them's missing.

326
00:20:46,058 --> 00:20:48,652
That thing of Schweinhart's
must have taken it.

327
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:52,993
But why?
Because Schweinhart must have
programmed him to do it.

328
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:55,829
That's his quaint idea
of humor, you know. Hmph.

00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:58,199
Very unprofessional.
Yes.

330
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,103
However, I only need this one
for the moment.
Mmm.

331
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:03,164
I want to test his reflexes.

332
00:21:05,611 --> 00:21:07,602
I say, Brubaker,
what's he doing?

333
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,674
I'm not sure.
But if he were a human being,
I'd say that he was having a tantrum.

334
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:17,886
Uh-uh-uh.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Temper. Temper.

Easy, boy. Easy, easy, easy, easy.

That's it. Yeah.

337
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:26,724
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
[Chuckles]

338
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,165
Easy. I want to show you
something, Brubaker.

339
00:21:29,234 --> 00:21:31,896
This over here will do fine.
[Squeaking]

340
00:21:31,971 --> 00:21:34,769
You know, I'm really going to miss him.
Oh.
[Chuckles]

341
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,502
I want you to watch
how his radar works now.

342
00:21:37,576 --> 00:21:39,703
I'm going to head him
towards the wall.

343
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:43,976
He'll fly to within inches of it,
then wheel off gracefully
and avoid it.

344
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:46,017
Are you ready?
Of course.

345
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:48,076
Here we go.

346
00:21:51,824 --> 00:21:56,261
Well, Brubaker, it looks like
we got stuck with the stupid one.

00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:01,089
Quick, Brubaker!
Grab him!

348

Say, are you lookin' for a bat?

Yes.
Uh... Oh.

350
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:15,036
He went that way.

351
00:22:15,114 --> 00:22:17,105
That way.

Uh, I say there, Corporal.
Yes, sir!

354
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:43,240
Uh, would you mind
calling a cab for me
for the airport?

355
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:45,299
I'm taking a plane home.

356
00:22:45,377 --> 00:22:48,676
I'd fly there myself,
but I've had a very trying day.

Yes, sir!

Who's the V.I.P.?
I don't know,
but he wants a cab.

00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:59,489
Get a load of the outfit on him.
Yeah, but you know
how the air force is.

360
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:02,118
It must be
their new dress uniform.

[Squeaking]
Will you come out of there, Grandpa,
and change back into yourself?

362
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:13,837
He's probably sulking
because the airline made him ride
back in the baggage compartment.

363
00:23:13,906 --> 00:23:16,841
Please, Grandpa,
I'll never trade you
for a rotten, old squirrel again.

364
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:18,968
Maybe we should give him
a piece of cheese.

365
00:23:19,044 --> 00:23:21,035
Maybe we oughta give her
a piece of cheese.

366
00:23:21,113 --> 00:23:24,879
It's not a her. It's a him.
Will you keep out of it?
We know what we're doing.

when you're here?

Well, I just flew in
from Washington.

out of the laboratory.

into orbit with me.

Gee, Grandpa.
It's nice to have you back.

Oh, Grandpa,
we're glad you're home.

You know, I'm as patriotic
as the next fellow,

376
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,349
but I'm not anxious
to be the first bat on the moon.

Isn't it romantic?

I always thought that bat
was part wolf.

Herman,

00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:37,712
I think it's about time you had
a little father-and-son talk
with Eddie here.
