1
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:30,532
Eddie, get your surfboard
in the car.

2
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,237
We're ready for the beach.
Okay, Mom.

3
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,651
Well, I'm all set.

4
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,919
With a little luck, I might dig
up a couple of old friends.

5
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,187
Is the hamper all
packed, Aunt Lily? Yes.

6
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,729
I even brought
a jar of ants.

7
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,230
(Grandpa) Good idea. Yes.

8
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,288
It would be just our luck
to get there...

9
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,268
and have none of the little dears
show up and spoil our picnic.

10
00:00:58,324 --> 00:00:59,860
Here comes Pop.

11
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:09,011
Pop, are you really going to go
swimming when we get to Paradise Cove?

12
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,548
When we get
to Paradise Cove...

13
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,049
I'm gonna swim out way over
my head and everything.

14
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:16,417
You can meet up with some very interesting
things way out in the briny deep.

15
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,220
So much for the national news.

16
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:26,491
We have a report of a Russian trawler in
local waters right off Paradise Cove.

17
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,931
So far, they've stayed beyond
the three-mile limit...

18
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,195
and they claim to be fishing.

19
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:35,535
But who knows what the results of this
little fishing expedition may be.

20
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,198
What a beautiful spot.
Yes.

21
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,504
But it certainly
was strange, dear.

22
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:47,636
Those hundreds of people running
off the beach just as we arrived.

23
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:52,739
Well, it's probably just another
one of those jellyfish scares.

24
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,850
Herman, where are you going?

25
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:01,915
Hmm?

26
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,756
Where are you going?

27
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,123
[laughing]

28
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,831
I'm going
scuba diving, dear.

29
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,530
And if I run into
any tasty-looking scubas...

30
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:20,169
I'll spear one, we can clean
it, and have it for supper.

31
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,255
Come on, Grandpa.

32
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,792
Let's find a spot where I
can bury you in the sand.

33
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,555
Okay, Eddie,
but this time bury me deep.

34
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,429
I don't want any crazy dogs
digging me up like last time.

35
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,425
<i>(announcer) That Russian trawler
spotted off our coast...</i>

36
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,834
<i>is still in the vicinity
of Paradise Cove.</i>

37
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,739
<i>They have their nets out and they are
still beyond the three-mile limit.</i>

38
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,173
<i>Well, good fishing, comrades.</i>

39
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,202
Come on, Grandpa.

40
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,804
Okay, let's go.

41
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:12,518
[exclaims]

42
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,789
These wolf burgers
are almost done.

43
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:19,098
Eddie, go down to the water and
call your father for lunch.

44
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,796
And by the way...

45
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,771
where did you bury Grandpa?

46
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,776
I sort of forget.
He's around here someplace.

47
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,575
Hey, Dad!

48
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,303
Dad!

49
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,377
Mom, I don't see
Pop anywhere.

50
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,476
Nonsense, Eddie.
He's right over there...

51
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,818
[exclaims]

52
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,125
Heavens to Betsy,
he's gone!

53
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,763
Oh, dear. I hope
nothing's happened to him.

54
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:53,770
I knew I shouldn't have let him go
in the water without his sea horsie.

55
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,170
Aunt Lily,
what are we going to do?

56
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:00,268
Eddie, here, take this and
poke around for your grandpa.

57
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:04,909
[Grandpa yells]

58
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,979
I think I found him.

59
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,449
Can't a body even get
some shuteye around here?

60
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,357
Grandpa, something's happened.

61
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,919
We think that Herman's been
washed out to sea.

62
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,261
So what's the problem?
He's Sanforized.

63
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,198
We've got to find him.

64
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,258
I hope a whale
hasn't eaten my pop.

65
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,965
I wanted him to help me
with my homework tonight.

66
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:31,474
Why did he take up
that silly scuba diving hobby?

67
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,969
You know, Lily, when Herman
gets caught up in a hobby...

68
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,344
he really gets
caught up in it.

69
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,780
Good night.

70
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,991
[speaking Russian]

71
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,336
[both speaking Russian]

72
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:16,509
Well...

73
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:17,777
[chuckles]

74
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,014
Scuba dooba do.

75
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,958
Oh, yeah? Well, the
same to you, Charlie.

76
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,491
What did the Bureau of Missing
Persons say, Grandpa?

77
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,695
Well, they say
that Herman didn't qualify.

78
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,828
Didn't qualify?

79
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,737
He's missing, isn't he?

80
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:40,573
He qualifies as missing,
but when I described him...

81
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,375
they said he didn't
qualify as a person.

82
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,737
Oh!

83
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,848
My poor pussycat.

84
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,352
Where, oh, where can he be?

85
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:59,988

I don't know how I'm gonna
make you chaps understand me.

91
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,667
You speak English!

92

[exclaims]

93
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,604
Well, isn't it
a small world.

94
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,476
Yes, I speak English.

95
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,173
Me speak English.

96
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,910
Me speak English.

97
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,006
[laughing]

98
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,408
Well...

99
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,580
Where did you learn it?
On the TV.

100
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:02,217
We watch Russian reruns,
Dobie Gil/is.

101
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,685
I'll be darned. TV.

102
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,565
It certainly is a great medium
for cultural exchange.

103
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,870
[speaking Russian]

104
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:24,008
You very valuable
anthropological find.

105
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,480
Thank you.

106
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,641
I do my best.

107
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,087
[giggling]

108
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:44,824
Uh...

109
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:49,204
Say, listen, have you fellas
heard any good jokes lately?

110
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,074
I heard a keen one
the other day:

111
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,705
What has four wheels
and flies?

112
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,336
[chuckling]

113
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,177
Could be new secret weapon.

114
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,751
Come on.

115
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,979
You're supposed to ask me, "What
has four wheels and flies?"

116
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,923
Okay, sea monster.

117
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,319
What has four wheels
and flies?

118
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,990
A garbage truck.

119
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,729
A garbage truck?

120
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,527
Garbage truck.

121
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,606
[all laughing]

00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,104
[speaking Russian]

123
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,520
Say, listen.
You're a very good group.

124
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,191
Here's another one
that'll really grab you.

125
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,142
Trawler number 47.

126
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:02,111
Reports finding missing link near
the United States of America.

127
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,712
Definitely puts Russians ahead
in missing link race.

128
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,774
Please advise.

129
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,381
Composite picture en route...

130
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,252
to Commissar on missing links.

131
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,018
Answer immediately.

132
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,185
This report top-secret.

133
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,893
Repeat. Top-secret.

134
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,873
I've just got
a Russian top-secret.

135
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,002
First one of the day.
Good work. What is it?

136
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,205
That's from a Russian trawler
just off our coast.

137
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,611
They radioed Moscow.

138
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,014
They found a missing link
in their fishing net.

139
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,052
Claim it's
a scientific breakthrough.

140
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,054
What's this missing link
look like?

141
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,354
Here is a composite we just drew up from
the Russian ship's description of it.

142
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,526
I can't imagine...

143
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,291
[bell ringing] what that's
the missing link to.

144
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,888
Just a minute.

145
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:02,537
Moscow is sending another top-secret
back to the Russian ship.

146
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,436
"Stupid idiots.

147
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,706
"From your description,
this is not missing link.

148
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,772
"You have obviously captured
new kind of American spy."

149
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,042
An American spy.

150
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:18,086
You'd better get this over to the
State Department right away.

151
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,420
They won't be back from lunch yet.
It's only 3:00.

152
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,552
That's a chance we're going to have to take.
Go on and get over there.

153
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,528
How often do the Russians
capture an American spy?

154
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,929
This is an emergency.
Yes, sir.

155
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:40,641
Well, Grandpa,
Herman is nowhere to be found.

156
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,640
Have you gotten anything
on that crystal ball of yours?

157
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,239
Wait a minute.

158
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,249
I'm adjusting
the fine tunings.

159
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,253
Hold it.

160
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,157
I think
I'm getting something now.

161
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,753
What is it?
I see an ocean.

162
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,323
I see a boat.

There he is. I see Herman.
What's he doing?

165
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,966
He's on a ship...

166
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,742
and he is leading up a bunch of
funny-looking men in community singing.

167

someone would have let me know.

00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,196
Herman,
you are coming with me.

321
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,838
Yes, dear.

322
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:43,168
But, lady, we're only having
a little farewell party.

323
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,145
Well, farewell to you.

324
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,979
You just take
your yacht of corruption...

325
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,146
and revelry and sail on,
home wreckers.

326
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,585
Don't talk that way
in front of my friends.

327
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,655
Herman, come along.

328
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:10,431
Well, fellas, Notchey,
goodbye.

329
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,704
If you're ever in Mockingbird
Heights, look me up.

330
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,314
That's what Americans
are really like.

331
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,118
Holy mackerel,
what party poopers!

332
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,321
Let's go.

333
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,492
N[music playing]

334
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,568
Lily, won't you
let me explain?

335
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,474
Grandpa...

336
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:51,810
will you tell that miserable person on
the couch that I am not speaking to him?

337
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:55,083
Miserable person
on the couch...

338
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,586
your wife
is not speaking to you.

339
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,913
You hear that, you fathead?

340
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,288
Please, Grandpa,
just translate.

341
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:04,793
Never mind
the editorial comment.

342
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,996
Even I'm surprised at you.

343
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:11,660
I never thought my dear, sweet,
kind uncle would go ape.

344
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:17,262
Well, golly-gee. How would you like it
if you were pulled out of the ocean...

345
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,808
in a fishnet
and dumped into a hole...

346
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,936
and have a bunch of people
think you were a missing link?

347
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,580
I tell you that sort of thing is
very damaging to your psyche.

348
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,006
[scoffs]

349
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:32,287
Why were you carousing
with those people?

350
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:37,253
Well, Lily, I was just trying to be one
of the boys and friendly and all that.

351
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:41,721
After all, dear, I am a member of the
Junior Chamber of Commerce, you know.

352
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,125
You've just got
to forgive me.

353
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,329
The way they do on television
every afternoon...

354
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:49,065
<i>on The Guiding Light.</i>

355
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,067
Go ahead, Lily.

356
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:54,076
Make up with the big slob
before he starts blubbering...

357
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:57,602
and washes all the furniture
out into the street again.

358
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,348
Well, all right.

359
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,178
I forgive you.

360
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,448
Thank you, dear.

361
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,817
That's real wizard of you.

362
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,961
But I want you to forget about
those Russian friends of yours...

363
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,399
and all of that singing
and dancing and carrying on.

364
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:21,163
I certainly will, dear.
I promise.

365
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,404
All right.

366
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:28,070
Now, come on upstairs,
we'd all better get to bed.

367
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,803
I'll be up in a minute,
sweetheart.

368
