Good day, madam.
Is your husband home?

Uh, I'm afraid he's not, sir.

You're so cute.
You just give me vulture-bumps all over.

7

L... I do have a certain built-in charm.
Lily, dear, was there any mail today?

8
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:42,887
No, but the express company
delivered a box from the Old Country.

9
00:00:42,956 --> 00:00:46,050
Oh.
I had them put it in here.

10
00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:49,391
Oh, let's see who it's from.

11
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:53,058
Eh, it's Uncle Gilbert!

12
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:56,899
We'll-We'll have you out in a jiffy,
Uncle Gilbert.
You're just in time for dinner.

13
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,906
No, no, Herman. It's not Uncle Gilbert.
It's from Uncle Gilbert.

14
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:05,308
Oh, eh, sorry. A natural mistake.

15
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,510
I don't know what's in it, but he sent a letter
asking us to keep it for him until he gets here.

16
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:13,951
He's coming over on a visit
in two or three days.
Oh!

17
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,181
Hey, Pop. I've been waiting
for you to get home.

18
00:01:16,256 --> 00:01:20,124
You can open the crate with
my genuine Transylvanian Boy Scout hatchet.

19

[Eddie]
Yippee.!

23
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:43,210
But Uncle Gilbert isn't a rich man.

24
00:01:43,283 --> 00:01:46,514
Where in the world would he get
thousands of dollars out of the blue?

25
00:01:46,586 --> 00:01:50,886
Well, Uncle Gilbert used to be a politician.

26
00:01:50,957 --> 00:01:56,918
Maybe Transylvania was declared
an unfriendly nation, and our government
automatically sent them foreign aid.

27
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:03,696
[Chuckling]

28
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:18,342
And here's your receipt,
Mrs. Munster.

29
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:23,280
When we learned you had
such a big deposit, we were happy
to send along our armored car.

30
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,309
I see it came to a hundred
and eighty thousand dollars.

31
00:03:27,387 --> 00:03:33,292
You know, those coins
are pure gold and very rare.
They appear to be Spanish doubloons.

32
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,851
Well, you've been very helpful,
Mr. Benson.

33
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:39,797
It would be a nuisance
to have all that loose change
kicking about the house.

34

[Chuckles]
Yeah. Yes.

Oh. This very efficient young man
has been very, very helpful.

37
00:03:51,678 --> 00:03:57,310
Oh, I guess you two haven't met.
Mr. Benson, this is my niece, Marilyn.

38

Uh, well... [Chuckles]
I'm very glad to meet you, Miss Alan.

My first name is Benson,
but you can call me Marilyn.

Oh, I'm sorry.
A hundred and eighty thousand pardons.

What I mean to say is,
l... I sure am delighted to meet ya.

Uh, well, bye.

Oh. Good evening, Grandpa, Lily.

44

Uh, sorry I had to work late,
dear, and eat downtown,

45
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:34,144
but before I left the parlor,
I had to lay out some work
for tomorrow.

46
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,087
That's all right, Herman,
but keep your voice down.

47
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:41,958
Hm? Keep my voice down?
What are you doing sitting
here in the kitchen?

48

Don't tell me Spot ate
the living room furniture again!
No, don't, no.

49
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:51,336
We're sitting here because
Marilyn is sitting in the living room
with a young man.

50
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:54,134
That new assistant manager
the bank sent over?

51
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:57,142
He fell for her
like a ton of headstones.

52
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,338
Plain, old, drab Marilyn?
Yes, Herman.

53
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:04,179
It must be either love or astigmatism.

54
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,650
Lily and I are trying to make sure
he doesn't get away.

55
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,554
Pretty soon, I'm going to sneak out
and bolt the front door.

56
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:16,187
I'm going out now and see
if they're sitting close together.
[Laughs]

57
00:05:16,262 --> 00:05:18,253
Lily.

58
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:23,268
Grandpa. I do not believe we should
try to push Marilyn's romance along.

59
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:26,328
We should let it take its own course.
But, Herman...

60
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:29,842
Uh, Grandpa. If Marilyn's clock
of romance has begun to tick,

61
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:33,538
it does not behoove us
to overwind her mainspring.

62
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:38,610
And the minute I saw you this morning,
I wanted to know you better.

63
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:41,814
Did you want something,
Aunt Lily?

64
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:46,689
I hate to disturb you two,
but could I borrow that pillow?

65

This one, Mrs. Munster?
Yes.

66
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:53,295
I was making some chicken soup,
and I ran out of feathers.

67
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:56,698
Hmm. These'll do nicely.

68
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,864
Yeah. Sure.
Oh, Mr. Benson,

69
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:02,339
uh, why don't you sit over here...

70
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:04,639
on the sofa next to Marilyn?

71
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:08,078
[Chuckles]
It's much more comfy.

72
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:10,582
Yes. Uh, thank you.

73

She makes chicken soup
with feathers?

Doesn't everyone?

75
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:28,665
How's everything going?
I borrowed the pillow out of his chair,
so he has to sit on the sofa next to Marilyn.

76
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:31,135
Good!
Listen, you two.

with a copy of your blueprints.

150
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:19,487
I know, dear.
I just hope wherever Marilyn is tonight,

151
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:24,394
she's looking into a pair of eyes
as romantic as mine.
[Laughs]

152
00:11:35,842 --> 00:11:38,174
There.
Does that change your mind any?

153
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:40,872
Gosh, Alan, I don't know.

154
00:11:40,947 --> 00:11:46,146
An elopement sounds romantic
and all that, but I hate to do things
behind my family's back.

155
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:50,815
Now, wait a minute. You say they
love you and want you to be happy.
They'll get used to it.

156
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:56,089
But I think you better talk
to my uncle about something
as important as marriage.

157
00:11:56,162 --> 00:12:00,155
He likes to do things
the old-fashioned way.
It's just the way he's put together.

158
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:04,499
But that's just it.
What if he says no or tells us to wait?

159
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,199
We might even lose each other forever.
You wouldn't want that to happen,
would you, doll?

160
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:10,265
Well, Alan, l...

161
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:19,050
Now, what were you saying?
Well,

162
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:22,110
an elopement might not
be such a bad idea after all.

163
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:30,456
Arrive New York Harbor, Friday.

164
00:12:31,464 --> 00:12:33,762
Will see you on weekend.

165
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:37,030
Hope money is in safe place.

166
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:40,970
Love and kisses, Uncle Gilbert.

167
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,305
Thank you, Operator.
Ho-ho!

168
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:46,902
Oh, Grandpa, isn't that exciting?
Yes.

169
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:50,210
He'll be here for the weekend.
Oh-ho-ho! Good old Gilly!

170
00:12:50,283 --> 00:12:52,979
He always was a fun fellow.

171
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:55,680
Now he'll get to meet
Marilyn's beau,

172
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:58,918
and if there's a wedding in the family,
he can stay over for it.

173
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:03,894
Yes, and if Marilyn gets to marry
that Mr. Benson, I won't mind
having a banker in the family.

174
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:08,229
After all, a fella who works in a vault
can't be all bad.

175
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:10,735
Well, maybe we're getting
our hopes too high.

176
00:13:10,803 --> 00:13:14,364
After all, Marilyn is plain,
and, well...
[Phone Ringing]

177
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,374
I'll get it.

178
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:18,876
?? [Humming]

179
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:23,347
Yeah, hello. It's the Munster residence.
The Count speaking.

180
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,180
You don't know me, sir,
but I'm a friend of Alan Benson's.

181
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:29,917
I thought I should warn you about
something that's going to happen tonight.

182
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:33,457
What? Elopement?

183
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:36,427
Yes, sir, and I feel
it's my duty to tell you.

184
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:39,021
He's marrying your niece for one reason...

185
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:41,498
that money you have in our bank.

186
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:45,299
Hello? Hello?

187
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:47,805
Hello!
Grandpa!

188
00:13:47,874 --> 00:13:50,399
What-What's this
about an elopement?
[Groans]

189
00:13:50,476 --> 00:13:54,276
That fella's marrying Marilyn for her money.
And they're gonna elope tonight!

190
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:57,613
Now let me get this straight.

191
00:13:57,683 --> 00:14:00,777
This fellow, Benson, is eloping
with our niece, Marilyn, tonight...

192
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:04,220
in order to get that hundred and eighty
thousand dollars we put in the bank?

193
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,488
- Yes, Herman, and Grandpa
and I have worked out a plan.
- I'm all ears.

194
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:12,429
Well, first of all,
Marilyn is so infatuated with this boy,

195
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:16,457
that if we told her the truth,
she wouldn't believe it, right?
Right.

196
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:21,735
Now, the next step is to get
Marilyn out of the way tonight,
so she can't elope with him, right?

197
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:26,801
Right.
And then we can confront this boy
with what we know. You follow me?

198
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,179
Follow you?
If we were any closer, we'd be dancing.

199
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,582
But how do we get
Marilyn out of the way?

200
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:38,647
Grandpa has a magic spell that'll transport her
back to Transylvania for the night.

201
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:42,888
And then, right after we get rid of
this Benson bum, I bring Marilyn back.

202
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:46,898
[Chuckles]
I got this spell right out of my magic book.

203
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:53,995
Herman, it's our only chance.
That mean Mr. Benson is going to be
here at midnight to elope with Marilyn.

204
00:14:54,073 --> 00:14:57,008
Come on. Let's go upstairs
and get this over with.

205
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:02,341
Sure are a lot of mean people
in the world.

206
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:06,283
Why can't life be the way it is
in Mary Poppins?

207
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:08,343
Aah!

208
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:10,412
[Groans]
Meanie!

209
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:15,158
Marilyn... [Chuckles]
Come with me...

210
00:15:15,228 --> 00:15:17,321
and stay right over here.

211
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:20,297
Eddie, over there, Lily, right here...

212
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,834
and Herman,
I'd like to have you over here.

213
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:27,965
Grandpa, what is this all about?
Marilyn, we'll explain later.
It's for your own good.

214
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,736
Eh, Marilyn dear, be a good girl,

215
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:35,474
and humor your poor,
old, decrepit grandfather.

216
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:38,108
Thank you.

217
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:45,188
Don't let time or space detain ya.

218
00:15:45,258 --> 00:15:47,818
Here you go to Transylvania.

219
00:15:58,237 --> 00:16:00,228
Grandpa!

220
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:02,240
L-It worked!

221
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:05,471
That was really neat!
[Chuckles]

222
00:16:05,544 --> 00:16:08,570
Grandpa, you really... Eh, Grandpa?

223
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:12,243
Grandpa! Lily, where did Grandpa go?

224
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:14,718
Eh, Lily? Lily? Lily!

225
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:18,553
Eh, Eddie, where-where's Lily?
Eddie? Eddie?

226
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:21,320
Where is everybody?

227
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:25,057
Hmm. [Clicks Tongue]
Well, wouldn't you know?

228
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:28,157
That old goofball "overspelled" himself!

229
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:30,668
They've all been transported!

230
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:32,931
[Phone Ringing]

231
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:36,907
Every time there's a crisis,
some boob has to telephone.

232
00:16:36,976 --> 00:16:39,137
[Ringing Continues]
Huh!

233
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:51,112
Hello?

234
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,784
Oh, hello, Grandpa.
Where are you?

235
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:57,818
Where am I?
I'm in the Happy Valley Motel in Kansas City.

236
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:00,661
Oh, really?
Say, how is the weather there?

237
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:05,864
Oh, it is clearing up a bit...
[Groans] Herman, the spell backfired.

238
00:17:05,938 --> 00:17:08,532
We're all here.

239
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,906
I'll be darned.
When are you coming back?

240
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:17,313
Look, Herman, all I've got
with me is the one-way spell.
You've gotta go down to the dungeon...

241
00:17:17,383 --> 00:17:22,013
and get the return-trip spell out of
my magic book and read it to me
over the phone.

242
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:25,717
Gotcha. Uh, be right back.

243
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:49,707
- Uh, Grandpa.
- Yes, Herman?

244
00:17:49,782 --> 00:17:55,345
- Um, what was it I was supposed to get?
- The return-trip spell out of my magic book.

245
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:58,481
That's right. Uh, don't go away.

246
00:18:10,736 --> 00:18:14,729
- Eh, Grandpa, it's me.
- Herman, did you get the formula?

247
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:20,040
No. It was dark down there,
and the book snapped at me again.

248
00:18:20,112 --> 00:18:24,481
Oh, brother!
Will someone please tell me
what's going on here?

249
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,745
Yeah, Mom. What's up?

250
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:29,515
Oh, Grandpa, give me that phone.

251
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:32,819
Take Marilyn in the other room
and tell her what happened.

252
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:35,884
Some sorcerer's apprentice he is.

253
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:39,397
Well, come, my dear.
I'll break it to you gently.

254
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:43,868
Now, first of all, that fella
you're in love with is a rat fink.

255
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:48,907
- Herman, are you there?
- Yes, Lily.

256
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:51,704
Now, listen, Herman.
It's almost midnight.

257
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:56,111
That Alan Benson is going to show up
in 20 minutes to elope with Marilyn.

258
00:18:56,182 --> 00:19:01,142
When he does, you're just going to have
to be there waiting for him in her place.

259
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,054
Well, that's a good idea, dear,
but don't you think he'll notice the difference?

260
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:09,220
Oh, Herman!
Herman, I don't want you to elope with him.

261
00:19:09,295 --> 00:19:11,456
I just want you to tell him off.

262
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,829
I see, dear. Tell him off. Uh, right.

263
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,891
Be forceful. Right.

264
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:19,665
Don't worry.
I'll give him a piece of my mind.

265
00:19:19,738 --> 00:19:23,799
When I have to be,
I can be a pretty terrifying individual.

266
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:38,179
[Wind Gusting]

267
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:53,395
Hmm. He'll be here in ten minutes.
[Clicks Tongue]

268
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:58,307
I guess I'll just turn out the light,
so I don't have to look at this
horrible furniture of Marilyn's.

269
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:06,746
Boy, when he comes through
that window and finds me sitting here,

270
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:11,415
he's really gonna think he tangled with a tiger.
[Chuckles]

271
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,481
[Yawning]

272
00:20:16,662 --> 00:20:18,653
[Snoring]

273
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:01,697
[Snoring Continues]

274
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:16,817
[Whispering]
Marilyn!

275
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:20,689
It's me, honey.
I've come to get ya!

276
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:29,025
How could she sleep at a time like this?
The least she could do is knock it off
with the snoring.

277
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:34,867
Come on, sweetheart. Wake up!

278
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,704
It's your Prince Charming
who's come to take you away.

279
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:43,780
Sweetie, darling. It's me, honey.

280
00:21:44,883 --> 00:21:47,545
That's strange.
She must wear mittens to bed.

281
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:52,447
Darling, are you...

282
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:57,418
Ohh! Ohh!

283
00:21:57,496 --> 00:22:00,897
Uh, young man, wait! Young man!

284
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:04,527
Young man?

285
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:08,432
Uh, young man!

286
00:22:12,645 --> 00:22:15,739
Young man? Young man.!

287
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:18,374
Young man! L...

288
00:22:19,985 --> 00:22:24,854
Well, he certainly left in a hurry.
I didn't even have a chance to tell him off.

289
00:22:24,923 --> 00:22:29,553
Well, I guess everyone looks
kind of frightening when they first wake up.

290
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:36,095
Well, Herman, I must say,
it's nice to be back home...

291
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:41,606
after a certain party
forced us to take a plane
all the way back from Kansas City.

292
00:22:41,674 --> 00:22:44,370
I'm sorry, Lily.
But I at least saved you a full fare...

293
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:47,139
by flying back under my own power!

294
00:22:47,212 --> 00:22:49,373
And I'm glad to be home too.

295
00:22:49,448 --> 00:22:53,111
The truth about Alan was an awful shock,
but I guess I'll get used to it.

296
00:22:53,185 --> 00:22:55,346
I'm sure you will, dear.

297
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:58,982
And to think that the money that
that young man was after isn't ours at all.

298
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:03,358
It belongs to Uncle Gilbert. Hmm!
Hey, Uncle Gilbert
oughta be here any minute.

299
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:05,989
Huh?
His plane got into the airport
15 minutes ago.

300
00:23:06,065 --> 00:23:08,966
Oh!
Dear, I hope he doesn't have
a hard time getting a taxi.

301
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:11,969
You know, sometimes...
[Pounding]

302
00:23:12,037 --> 00:23:14,471
I'll bet that's Uncle Gilbert!

303
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,531
I'll get it!

304
00:23:20,546 --> 00:23:22,707
That's who it is!
Herman!

305
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:25,045
Uncle Gilbert! Come right in!
How are you?

306
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:28,553
Well, now, it certainly is good...

307
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,818
to drop in on my favorite relatives!

308
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:34,882
Oh, yes!

309
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:38,189
Hello, Uncle Gilbert!
Hi, Uncle Gilbert!

310
00:23:38,263 --> 00:23:41,460
[Overlapping Chatter]
Come right in and sit down,
Uncle Gilbert!

311
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:44,468
We haven't seen you
in such a long time.
Come right in and sit down.

312
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:47,004
How are things going?
Swimmingly.

313
00:23:47,072 --> 00:23:51,736
Oh, but say, let me get out of these
dry things and into something wet.

314
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:55,268
Well, sit down, Uncle Gilbert!
Yes!

315
00:23:57,449 --> 00:24:02,785
Well, Uncle Gilbert, before I forget it,
all that money you sent us is safe in the bank.

316
00:24:02,855 --> 00:24:05,221
Fine, fine.

317
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,884
But, Uncle Gilbert? Uh, just one thing.

318
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,418
Uh, we were a little curious.
Where did you get all that gold?

319
00:24:11,497 --> 00:24:15,866
Yeah, Uncle Gilbert.
Where'd you get all those neat
Spanish doubloons and rare gold pieces?

320
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:18,732
Oh, those! Oh, why, Eddie, my boy,

321
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:20,999
that's loose change I picked up...

322
00:24:21,073 --> 00:24:25,134
in ships and treasure chests
lying around in my neighborhood.

323
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,440
- No foolin'!
- Sure!

324
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:30,812
That's one reason I wouldn't live
anyplace else in the world.

325
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:34,114
Oh, there's a lot of advantages, my boy,

326
00:24:34,186 --> 00:24:37,485
to being the Creature
from the Black Lagoon.

327
00:24:37,556 --> 00:24:39,922
[Eddie]
Yeah!
[All Laughing]
