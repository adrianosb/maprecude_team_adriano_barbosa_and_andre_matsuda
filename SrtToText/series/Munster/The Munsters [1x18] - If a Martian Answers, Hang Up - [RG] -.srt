154
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:09,350
Hello, Mars?
This is W6XRL4.

155
00:10:09,422 --> 00:10:11,356
Where are you?
[Switch Clicks]

156
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:13,415
We have just penetrated
through substratosphere...

157
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:16,462
and made our first landing
on Earth. Over.

158
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:18,463
[Switch Clicks]
They're here!
They're here!

159
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:20,590
They-They've landed
on Earth!
All right.

160
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:23,227
All right, Herman.
Don't get so excited.

161
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:26,238
It's only people from Mars.

162
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:28,672
People from Mars?

163
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:33,578
Grandpa! Grandpa!

164
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:35,671
[Switch Clicks]
Don't go away.
I'll be right back.

165
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:46,147
Grandpa. Grandpa.
Grandpa.

166
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:50,688
Will you wake up,
you dummy!

167
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:52,754
We're making history.

168
00:10:52,832 --> 00:10:54,857
Hello. Hello.

169
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:58,495
Come in, Earth.
Come in, Earth.

170
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:00,562
I guess somethin' happened
to our friend from Earth.

171
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,370
Maybe the kid's parents made him
go take a bath or somethin'.

172
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:07,243
Aw, let's come back after supper.
Maybe we can get him then.

173
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:09,304
You really think it's a kid?

174
00:11:09,382 --> 00:11:12,112
He must be.
He sounds so stupid.

175
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:22,261
Now, Grandpa, Grandpa.

176
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:24,262
You heard them.

177
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,493
They're men from Mars,
and they've landed on Earth.

178
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,592
We have to go call the air force.

179
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:33,196
They have a department that checks
on unidentified flying objects.

180
00:11:33,272 --> 00:11:36,901
Not so fast, Herman.
We can't just go
and call the air force.

181
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:39,467
You want 'em to think
we're a couple of nuts?

182
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:41,479
Oh. Heavens, no.

183
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:45,643
Before we call the air force,
we have to have concrete evidence.

184
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:47,652
But where are we
gonna get evidence?

185
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,019
All we have to go by
is a voice on the radio.

186
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:56,323
Don't worry, Herman.
I'll find that spaceship
with my direction finder.

187
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:58,387
Come on.

188
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:05,537
I've got it in here somewhere.

189
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:08,301
Let me see.
What do we have here?

190
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:12,174
Oh. A rabbit's foot
carried by General Custer.

191
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,876
Mother's Day card
from Lizzie Borden.

192
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:20,809
Compass off the Titanic.

193
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:23,219
Ah! Here it is!
[Laughing]

194
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:25,280
Yeah!

195
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:29,385
My radio direction finder.
Direction finder?

196
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:32,192
Grandpa, that's just
an old-fashioned divining rod.

197
00:12:32,265 --> 00:12:37,202
True, true.
But I had it transistorized
last month.

198
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:42,337
Grandpa.
Yeah?

199
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:44,808
If we find this spaceship,

200
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:47,573
you and I will be famous
all over the world.

201
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:49,581
[Both Laughing]

202
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:58,046
Hey, Mom.

203
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:02,955
How come Grandpa and Dad
aren't having dinner with us?

204
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:06,192
Well, Grandpa said
they had to go out tonight
on important business.

205
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:09,029
But Grandpa didn't even
take his shovel.

206
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:12,196
Something's up, Aunt Lily.
They weren't their usual selves.

207
00:13:12,271 --> 00:13:14,603
They looked very strange
when they went out.

208
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:17,074
I don't know what's the matter,

209
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:20,601
but Herman's been acting funny
ever since he got that ham radio set.

210
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,945
Oh, but he does need a hobby.
He works hard all week.

211
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:26,177
[Sighs]
That's true, Marilyn.

212
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:28,880
You know,
Herman took up golf once,

213
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:31,446
but he had so much trouble
getting together a foursome.

214
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:35,460
Hey, Mom, maybe Dad's
out playing poker with some men.

215
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:39,191
When he comes home,
you'll have to yell at him
and make him sleep on the sofa.

216
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:43,895
- Eddie. Where do you get
ideas like that?
- From television.

217
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,064
You see, Marilyn,
it's just the way I told you.

218
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,770
Those shows on television
about horrible families
have a definite effect on children.

219
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:56,338
[Steady Clicking]

220
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:06,887
Grandpa, we've been
following that divining rod
for over an hour now,

221
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,950
and we haven't seen
a Martian yet.

222
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:12,293
Don't worry, Herman.
We'll find that spaceship
before the night's over.

223
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:14,299
Well, I certainly hope so.

224
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:18,098
The only thing it's led us to so far
is a shortwave diathermy machine.

225
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:21,368
That lady looked very upset
when she saw us
peering in her window.

226
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,809
Will you stop worrying, Herman?
She'll be down off the chandelier
before morning.

227
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:28,803
[Loud Clicking]

228
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:33,045
Look, Herman!
It's found something.
[Laughing]

229
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:37,112
You see?
I told you it'd work.

230
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,215
[Laughing]

231
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,388
Grandpa, they're down there.
Right.

232
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:46,454
The Martians
are hiding down there.

233
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:54,739
[Chuckles]

234
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:58,470
Hi, Martians.
Are you down there?

235
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,946
[Clicking Stops]

236
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:10,818
[Gasping]

237
00:15:12,258 --> 00:15:14,226
You big dummy!

238
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:16,352
Why didn't you tell me
it was set for "Water"?

239
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,498
What are ya squawking about?
You could've got a face full of scrap iron.

240
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,973
Calling W6XRL4.

241
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:33,705
This is spaceship X-14.

242
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,770
Would somebody come in?

243
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:41,312
Would somebody
please come in? Please?

244
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:44,379
Gee, Rog, I wonder
where that other kid is.

245
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:46,550
He hasn't been on the air
since 4:00.

246
00:15:46,626 --> 00:15:49,390
Maybe he's a little shrimp
and can't stay out this late.

247
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:51,589
Let's keep on trying
for a little while longer.

248
00:15:51,664 --> 00:15:55,327
[Clicking]

249
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:59,360
[Clicking Louder]
Hey, Herman.
We're getting something.

250
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:02,999
Look. It's over here.
Oh, boy!

251
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:05,202
I hope it's not
another false alarm.

252
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:07,269
Come on.

253
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:15,414
Look! Herman, a spaceship.

254
00:16:18,324 --> 00:16:20,690
Grandpa.

255
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,058
We're making history.

256
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:26,997
We're Galileo, Columbus
and David Susskind
all rolled into one.

257
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:31,628
Look, Herman.
There are two Martians
by the ship,

258
00:16:31,704 --> 00:16:34,764
and look how little
they are.

259
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,400
Just like in the comic strips.

260
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:40,604
Come on.
We'll welcome them to planet Earth.

261
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:48,419
Hello there!

262
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:51,081
Ahoy, Martians!

263
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:53,990
[Screaming]
Go! Go!

264
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,290
They ran away.

265
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:58,853
I guess they're just
not used to Earth people,

266
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:01,729
but can you imagine anyone
being afraid of us?

267
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:06,135
Well, maybe their standards of beauty
aren't as high as ours.

268
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:08,639
Grandpa.
What?

269
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,268
I'm getting scared.

270
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:14,177
Those Martians might come back
with a ray gun and disintegrate us.

271
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:18,472
I'd feel like a perfect fool
if they did.

272
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:21,577
Let's at least get
some concrete evidence.

273
00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:25,954
We'll take a picture of the ship
we can show to the air force.

274
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:27,959
Good idea.

275
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:42,003
Say "cheese."

276
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:44,599
Will you knock it off
and take the picture!

277
00:17:44,677 --> 00:17:46,611
"Cheese."

278
00:17:55,855 --> 00:17:58,380
Hmm.

279
00:17:58,457 --> 00:18:02,723
And you say you and your son-in-law
took this photo last night.

280
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:04,729
That's right, Captain.

281
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:09,234
You see, he's been in voice communication
with Mars for the past few days.

282
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:12,464
You mean he's been talking
to the little people up there.

283
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:15,200
Yes. He has a ham radio.

284
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:18,437
A radio.
That must have made it a lot easier.

285
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:23,005
Oh, of course. As soon as the Martians
told us that they were going to land,

286
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:27,951
I got out my divining rod
to help track them down.

287
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,787
You have a divining rod.
Yes, and it's transistorized.

288
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:35,326
All I have to do
is set it for "Martians,"

289
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:38,420
and it led us to their spaceship
on a vacant lot.

290
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:40,658
There were two little men there,

291
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:43,759
and, as soon as they saw us,
they ran away.

292
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:47,636
I wonder why.

293
00:18:47,706 --> 00:18:49,799
You see, I don't know either,

294
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:54,471
but we felt it our patriotic duty
to bring it to the attention
of the government.

295
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:58,916
Well, I can't tell you how much
we appreciate your coming in here...

296
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:01,350
and taking up our time
like this.

297
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,878
What?
[Stammering]
You mean that's it?

298
00:19:04,957 --> 00:19:07,755
We discover a spaceship
and Martians,

299
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:11,092
and it's just "How do you do,
hello and good-bye"?

300
00:19:11,163 --> 00:19:15,031
Oh, no. I can assure you
that this photo will be processed
through proper channels.

301
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,935
Uh, Captain, if you don't mind,
this is very important to me.

302
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:22,599
- I'll wait outside.
- Excellent.

303
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:25,901
Sergeant, come in, please.

304
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,176
Aunt Lily, that was
Uncle Herman's boss on the phone.

305
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:36,448
They're looking for him
down at work.

306
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:38,820
He didn't even
go to work today, Marilyn.

307
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:41,917
He's playing
with that ham radio again.

308
00:19:41,994 --> 00:19:44,827
They said they were taking inventory
down at the parlor,

309
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:47,695
and Uncle Herman's the only one
who knows where things are.

310
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:54,930
Hello? This is W6XRL4
calling spaceship X-14.

00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,941
Come in, please.
Come in, please.

00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,048
We were standin' here
playing Martian last night, Pop,

316
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,485
and those two big guys
came along.

317
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:12,115
They had on real scary masks
and yelled at us,

318
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:14,625
and one of them
was carrying a big stick.

319
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:16,957
Why, they oughta be
ashamed of themselves.

320
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:20,795
One thing I can't stand
is a wise guy bully.

321
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:25,360
Listen, Roger, I want...
[Herman Over Walkie-Talkie]
Calling X-14. Come in, please.

322
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:28,804
Come in, please.
That's the guy now, Pop.

323
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:30,865
Here, give me that thing.

324
00:20:30,943 --> 00:20:33,207
Hello. This is X-14.

Oh, I'm so very glad I got you.

to run away last night.

Why, I'm W6XRL4,

00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:48,723
one of the Earth people.

330
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:52,059
You sound very, uh, big.

331
00:20:52,131 --> 00:20:54,361
Are you the head Martian?
[Switch Clicks]

332
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:58,062
Yeah, I'm the head Martian.
You know what I'm gonna do, buster?

333
00:20:58,137 --> 00:21:01,573
If I ever run into you,
I'm gonna break your arm off
and shove it down your throat!

334
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,234
[Switch Clicks]
Hmm.

335
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,837
Well-Well, you just
can't do that, Mr. Martian,

336
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:10,507
because you don't know
where I am.

337
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,051
So there.

338
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:17,179
Well, in that case, I guess I'll just
have to blow up the planet Earth.

339
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,150
Oh, my goodness!

340
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:31,068
Lily! Lily! Lily!

341
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:33,104
The world's coming to an end.

342
00:21:33,172 --> 00:21:36,471
And it's... And it's all my fault.
[Whimpering]

343
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:39,067
There, there, dear.

344
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:50,077
Herman?
Lily?

345
00:21:51,223 --> 00:21:53,248
Is anybody home?

346
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,751
Marilyn?

347
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:05,693
Herman, what are you doing?
Grandpa, the world's
coming to an end,

348
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:08,604
and we're hiding out
till it's over.

349
00:22:08,674 --> 00:22:11,472
Herman, will you
let us out of here!

350
00:22:11,543 --> 00:22:16,139
He keeps talking about men from Mars
blowing up the world.
It's true, Grandpa.

351
00:22:16,215 --> 00:22:18,649
While you were out,
I talked to the head Martian,

352
00:22:18,717 --> 00:22:23,051
and he got mad at me and started
calling me names and said
he was gonna blow up the world.

353
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:25,556
Herman, will you
pipe down a minute and listen?

354
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:27,558
That was no spaceship we found.

355
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:31,187
The air force identified it
as a child's toy...

356
00:22:31,263 --> 00:22:33,857
sold in every department store.

357
00:22:33,932 --> 00:22:38,596
And those two Martians we saw?
It wasn't them.

358
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:41,606
It was two kids playing spacemen.

359
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:45,674
- You're kidding.
- Kidding?

360
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:51,949
Look.

361
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:14,538
"Made in Japan"?

362
00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:16,631
There you are, Herman.

363
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:20,145
No Martians, no spaceship,
no end of the world.

364
00:23:20,212 --> 00:23:23,545
Now what do you have
to say for yourself?

365
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:26,175
Well,

366
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:28,344
that's the way
the ball bounces.

We just came down here
to get you away from that radio.

371
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,516
That's right, Herman.
It's caused us nothing but trouble.

372
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:02,953
Don't worry. I'm just trying
to get some music so I can relax.

373
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:05,649
Maybe Lawrence Welk
or someone.

374
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:07,658
But, Uncle Herman...

[Man Over Radio]
Come in, spaceport.
Come in, please.

This is spaceship Astro-70
calling Mars.

00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,824
Calling Mars.
[Airwave Static]
