00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,402

2
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:27,802
Grandpa, Lily.

3
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,932
Something terrible
has happened. Come quick.

4
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,101
Hurry.
Herman, what's wrong?

5
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:36,272
I know, they fired you at the parlor.
You've been lying down on the job again.

6
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:40,375
No, the one time I did lie down,
they mistook me for a customer.

7
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,684
I almost got carried
away that time.

8
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,949
Then what is it?
What is it?

9
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:49,216
It's after 4:00 and little
Eddie's usually home by noon.

10
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:52,961
I know something terrible
has happened to my little boy.

11
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:56,065
Call the police. Get the FBI.

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,769
Herman, will you knock it off?
Don't lose your head.

13
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,136
He's probably with
one of his little friends.

14
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,740
Hey, Charlie, you want to
come in my house and play?

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,746
Are your parents home?
Sure.

16
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:09,906
Forget it.

17
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,182
What's wrong with
my parents being home?

18
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:16,413
You know how parents are.
They're always mean to kids.

19
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,251
My parents aren't mean.
Sure they are.

20
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,518
You're just too dumb
to notice it.

21
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,589
Now, you take my parents.

22
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,028
They're the meanest parents
in the whole world.

23
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:29,559
You know, Eddie,
they're so mean to me...

24
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:33,568
that tonight at 7:00,
I'm gonna run away for good.

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,001
Run away? Where?

26
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,275
Run away to a cave
in the woods...

27
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:41,436
and live on nuts and herbs
and trap wild animals.

28
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,113
I'm never coming back
as long as I live.

29
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:48,409
Yeah, but why are you waiting
till 7:00 to run away?

30
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,919
Well, heck, I don't
want to miss supper.

31
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:56,516
Eddie, won't you come in now
and help me set the table?

32
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,826
And then you have to tidy up your room.
Yes, Mom.

33
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,732
You see, Eddie, your parents
are, too, mean to you.

34
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:08,368
Why don't you run away
from home with me tonight?

35
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,906
They haven't been
that mean to me, yet.

36
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,366
You wait and see.
They will be.

37
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,479
You shouldn't let
them get away with it.

38
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:20,047
I suppose if they got real
mean, I might run away.

39
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,511
Now you're talking, Eddie.
See you. See you.

40
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:32,662
Well, Eddie, how did
everything go at school today?

41
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,633
Pop, do you always
have to pick on me?

42
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,563
Hey, Mom. Could I stay up an extra
hour past my bedtime tonight?

43
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,943
Well, there's no school tomorrow.
I guess you could.

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,576
You mean nobody's gonna
yell at me and tell me no?

45
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:59,116
Of course not, Eddie.
It's all right with us.

46
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:03,052
Eddie, why don't you have another piece of pie?
It's your favorite.

47
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,847
You're gonna make me?

48
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,450
Of course we're not gonna make you.
Marilyn just thought you'd enjoy some.

49
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,387
Hey, Grandpa...

50
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,455
when I was playing down
in your laboratory...

51
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,899
I dropped ajar on the floor
and broke it.

52
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,459
When did that happen?

53
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,335
It was last month. One night
when I was doing my homework.

54
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,376
And when I dropped it,
it spilled all over the floor.

55
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,378
Eddie, don't worry about it.
It was a long time ago.

56
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,574
And anyway, what's the use
of crying over spilled blood?

57
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,915
Boy, some family this is.

58
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,855
Nobody even cares enough to be
mean to me like other parents.

59
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:43,587
I'm gonna go lock myself in my room
till people start being nice to me.

60
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,362
Heavens to Betsy!

61
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,629
Whatever has gotten into
our sweet little Eddie?

62
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,228
It's nothing, dear.

63
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,798
It's probably just another one
of those adolescent cycles.

64
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:03,010
I believe a child psychiatrist would
refer to it as "the punk phase."

Yes, Marilyn?

78
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:59,036
I was just talking to Eddie
through the bedroom door.

79
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:02,262
And he said something about running
away and never coming back.

80
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,638
Oh, my poor little Eddie.

81
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,874
Herman, go right upstairs
and stop him.

Lily, dear.

83
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,374
You must realize that Eddie's threat
is merely a subtle bid for attention.

84
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,584
And to give in to it would
only lead to his achieving...

85
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,179
a psychological advantage
over his parents.

86
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,189
Herman, what do you know
about kids?

87
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,759
You, who spent your childhood
in three different jars.

Don't let him out.

Now, everyone just calm down.

If you'll let me talk to him,
and you'll go in the kitchen...

00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,638
I'll handle this as father to son.
But, Herman--

Lily, dear, I know what's best
for my little boy.

And after you come back
in here, I guarantee you...

Yes, I have.

00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,167
But you were supposed to reason
with him and talk him out of it.

158
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,110
Lily, dear, I just used
a little psychology.

159
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,374
And believe me...

160
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,280
he'll merely walk once, maybe
twice, around the block...

161
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,650
and then come knocking on our
door, begging for forgiveness.

162
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:49,225
What do you think, Grandpa?
What do I think?

163
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,391
I'll tell you what I think.

164
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,727
I think there are more nuts in
this family than there are bolts.

165
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,357
That's what I think.

166
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,128
Charlie, it's me, Eddie.

167
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,194
[door opening]

168
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,671
Charlie.

169
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,575
[crickets chirping]

170
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,014
That you, Eddie?
Yeah.

171
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:14,017
I left home and I'm ready to run away
with you to the cave in the woods.

172
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,150
I'll be right down, Eddie.

173
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,281
[sawing]

174
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,384
<i>9:00. Now, where's the kid?</i>

175
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,061
[squawking]

176
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,897
Herman, that bird is right.

177
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:34,130
Eddie has been gone for over an
hour, and there's no sign of him.

178
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,663
Just when is he going to come knocking
on our door, begging forgiveness?

179
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,732
(raven)
Nevermore.

180
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,870
Aunt Lily, Uncle Herman.

181
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,505
Look at this note
I found in Eddie's room.

182
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,243
"Dear Mean Family...

183
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:52,517
"I have run away to live in a cave in
the woods for the rest of my life.

184
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,557
"And from there I'm going
to a desert island...

185
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:59,858
"so in the newsreel if you should ever
see a cannibal with a fat stomach...

186
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,726
"it may be
your ex-son, Eddie Munster."

187
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,760
Oh. my poor baby.

188
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:10,198
"P.S. I took
five pair of extra socks...

189
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:13,070
"because I don't want
to die with dirty feet."

190
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,545
Oh, boy, my son-in-law,
the child psychologist.

191
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:22,647
Herman Munster, Eddie said something
about going out in some woods...

192
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,882
now I want you to go right out
and find him.

193
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:29,185
And take your warm jacket. And
don't you come back without him.

194
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:33,594
Herman, you go right ahead. I'll try to
locate my grandson on my crystal ball.

195
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,458
All right, I'll go.

196
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:40,566
But I just don't understand what
went wrong with my child psychology.

197
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,406
It always worked
on Leave It to Beaver.

198
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,475
(Leo)
Mr. White, Olga is gone.

199
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,709
Somebody must have
left her cage unlocked.

200
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,116
The greatest attraction
we ever had.

201
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,720
What about the cub? She took
her little baby with her.

202
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,225
Look, Mr. White, the last time this
happened she headed for the nearest woods.

203
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,194
Why don't I take a couple of boys
here and comb all the local woods?

204
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,559
It's a chance.

205
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,666
She may be holed up somewhere.
But be careful.

206
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:13,394
Ever since Olga lost her mate,
she can get real mean.

207
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,696
Five hundred pounds mean.

208
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:18,964
Charlie...

209
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,238
this afternoon you said
you were gonna run away...

210
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,109
and live in a cave
in Fosters Woods.

211
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,639
That was this afternoon. I'm not
allowed to go out after dark.

212
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,909
Beside, I just ran away 'cause I
thought you were gonna run away.

213
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,520
Why don't you just go home?

214
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,653
I can't.
My parents would laugh at me.

215
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,258
Don't blame me 'cause you
got rotten old parents.

216
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:44,400
I better go in now. My folks would get
worried if they found me out of bed.

217
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,992
Yeah, sure.

218
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,440
Hey, you really gonna run away and
live in a cave in Fosters Woods?

219
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,176
I don't know. I may go
someplace and get sick first.

220
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,409
Eddie.

221
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,512
Eddie.

222
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,125
Olga.

223
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,029
Eddie.

224
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,095
Eddie.

225
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,699
Crazy echo in this woods.

226
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,837
I call out "Olga" and it comes
back sounding like "Eddie."

227
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,302
[creaking]

228
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,743
Grandpa.

229
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,147
Did you pick up Eddie
on your crystal ball?

230
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,183
No.

231
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,119
It's not working tonight.
Too much interference.

232
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:43,323
All I kept getting was some kind of
jungle movie, something about two bears.

233
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,591
Two bears? Yes, a big
one and a little one.

234
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,997
It was a silly thing. The big one
was dancing and then it went off...

235
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,535
and left the little one alone,
asleep in a cave.

236
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:55,800
I figured a commercial was coming
up, so I turned the thing off.

237
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,171
Eddie.

238
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,168
Eddie.

239
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:11,717
[chuckling] A cave. I just might
stumble onto something here.

240
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,725
Eddie.

241
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,692
[grunting]

242
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,628
Darned old cave.

243
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,500
Last match.

244
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,335
[bear snoring]

245
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:40,844
Eddie?

246
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,851
Poor little fellow.
He's sound asleep.

247
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,548
[Herman laughing]

248
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,248
Oh.

249
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,886
You brought along
your wooly P.J.s. Good boy.

250
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,624
But we mustn't let you
catch a cold.

251
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,631
Here we go.

252
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,496
There.

253
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,709
Now,
you just go right on sleeping.

254
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,100
[chuckles]

255
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,948
You must be chilled to the bone.
I never felt such a wet nose.

256
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,443
[grunting]

257
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,884
[gasping]

258
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,916
You'll be beddy-bye
in no time.

259
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,751
[laughing]

260
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,167
Olga.

261
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,769
When we find her, I sure hope
nothing's happened to make her mean.

262
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,505
Lily. Grandpa.

263
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,242
Marilyn. I'm home.

264
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,882
Eddie, we'll have you
tucked in, in a minute.

265
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,583
What's all the shouting about?

266
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:55,750
I found him.

267
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,624
Lily, I found him.
I found Eddie.

268
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,230
I told you I would.

269
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,420
[laughs]

270
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,731
There's a lot more up here
than most people think.

271
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,598
I don't know
what you've got up there...

272
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,970
but I would like to know what
you have wrapped in your coat.

273
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,775
Why, it's Eddie.

274
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,203
You know, our son.

275
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,647
Uncle Herman, Eddie came home
right after you left.

276
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,680
He's been in bed for hours.

277
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,677
[stuttering]
Upstairs in bed?

278
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,086
Why, that's ridiculous.

279
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,983
Eddie, son...

280
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,149
wake up and tell them
that you're not upstairs...

281
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,094
you're down here
with your old dad. Eddie?

282
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,420
Eddie?

283
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,159
[sighing]

284
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,556
[whimpering]

285
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,664
Eddie, what have
they done to you?

286
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,972
Herman, you big dummy,
you brought home a baby bear.

287
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:49,606
You just go on and take
him back where you found him.

288
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,780
Yes, dear.

289
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,677
Lily, can't we keep him?
Golly, he's so cute.

290
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,750
Cootchie-coo.

291
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,318
Now, listen, Herman.

292
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,953
You take that bear back
wherever it was you found him.

293
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,658
Lily, dear, you don't have to shout.
You're scaring the poor little fellow.

294
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,167
Herman, he's a bear.
How do you know he's scared?

295
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,004
Grandpa, I am holding him.

296
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,030
And believe me, he's scared.

297
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:31,011
Where do you suppose Uncle
Herman found that bear cub?

298
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,986
Wait a minute. That's the little
bear I saw in my crystal ball.

299
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,819
That's right, Grandpa.

300
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,487
You said there
was another bear. A big bear.

301
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:46,234
What if Herman should come face
to face with that other bear?

302
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:51,474
I'd say it was gonna be an interesting
experience for both parties.

303
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,313
[snoring]

304
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:03,944
There you go.

305
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,255
Now, you be a nice
little fellow and sleep tight.

306
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,356
And stay nice and warm
in Uncle Herman's coat.

307
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,720
[chuckles]

308
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,426
Mighty-night.

309
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:25,631
[growling]

310
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,447
Hi, there.
Nice evening, isn't it?

311
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,710
Wait a minute.

312
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,315
You're a bear.

313
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,080
Oh.

314
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,682
I get it.

315
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,125
That must be your cub in there
and you think that I...

316
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,664
[stammering]

317
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,425
You're angry because you...

318
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,524
[clearing throat]

319
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,866
I do hope
we can be adult about this.

320
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,432
Then you're not mad?

321
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,801
[laughs]

322
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,748
How about that.
You want to be friends.

323
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,011
[Herman laughing]

324
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,827
[growling]

325
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,200
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

326
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,873
[growling]

327
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,739
You're very kind.
You know...

328
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,769
I'm very glad
Iran into you this evening.

329
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:41,441
I have had one of the most upsetting
evenings in my whole life.

330
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,415
Now...

331
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:46,221
I wouldn't tell
this to everybody, but...

332
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,819
my wife
doesn't understand me.

333
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,132
Father, I can't imagine
what's happened to Herman.

334
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,227
He's been gone
for over an hour.

335
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:04,172
Maybe he dropped in at the parlor to
lay out a few things for tomorrow.

336
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:07,071
No, he wouldn't do that.
I'm worried about him.

337
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,409
He might have gotten himself lost out there.
What do you mean, Lily?

338
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,339
He's a grown man.

339
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,743
He knows his way around.
He's resourceful.

340
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,979
He has
a lot of intelligence...

341
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,187
Come on, Lily, let's go and
look for the big boob.

342
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,525
[creaking]

343
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,592
Olga.

344
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,097
Olga.

345
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,734
Herman.

346
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,772
Wait a minute, Lily. There's someone
over there in that clearing.

347
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,176
(Grandpa) No. It's just
two people dancing.

348
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:52,221
Holy mackerel!
It is Herman.

349
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,091
My, you dance divinely.

350
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,888
But for a change...

351
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,131
would you mind if I lead?

352
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:04,990
[laughs]

353
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,698
Thank you.

354
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:11,770
Who's that lady he's dancing with?
That's no lady. That's a bear.

355
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,810
Say...

356
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,240
you wouldn't want to go out
to a nightclub, would you?

357
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:20,305
[grunts]

358
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:21,373
[laughs]

359
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,121
IJ'[Herman humming]

360
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,115
Sorry, no cutting in.

361
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,456
Herman Munster.

362
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:33,885
Oh!

363
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:35,458
It's you, Lily.

364
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,660
Yes, it's me, you philanderer.

365
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,035
Allow me to present my wife.

366
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,800
Sweetheart, this is Olga.

367
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,507
You brazen little hussy, you.

368
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,446
[velpins]

369
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,780
That is no way
to treat a mother.

370
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,187
And let that be a lesson
to you, you home wrecker.

371
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,785
[sobbing]

372
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,665
Father, now what do you think
of your son-in-law?

373
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,499
I think he's been watching
Peyton Place too much.

374
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,933
You must let me explain, dear.
Herman...

375
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,135
get going.
Lily.

376
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,002
Home, Herman.
Lily.

377
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,805
(Lily)
Get going, Herman.

378
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,546
Olga.

379
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,614
[Olga sobbing]

380
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,417
There's Olga. Up a tree.

381
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,559
Look at her.
She's shaking like a leaf.

382
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,725
Come on down, Olga.
It's just us.

383
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,091
[grunting]

384
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,600
After a night like this, I
wind up with a neurotic bear.

385
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,577
Eddie, would you like
another owl omelet?

386
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,414
No, thanks, Mom. I'm still
kind of tired from last night.

387
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:06,153
And no wonder. Running away from home and
upsetting your parents the way you did.

388
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,282
I hope you've learned a lesson
from this, Eddie.

389
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:12,351
Not to listen to friends
who give you bad advice.

390
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,023
Charlie Pike
talked me into it...

391
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,464
and then when Dad opened
the door and said goodbye...

392
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,195
I had to run away.

393
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:24,265
Eddie, sometimes parents, in
trying to help their children...

394
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,800
don't always
do the right thing.

395
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,570
Parents aren't perfect.
Yes.

396
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:33,715
Like a certain big knot-head who
thinks he's the waltz king.

397
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:38,677
I will thank you not to bring
that subject up in front of my...

398
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:42,121
S-O-N. (Lily) Yes, Grandpa...

399
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:46,160
we're going to let bygones be
bygones and resume our life...

400
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:50,495
as an ordinary, everyday,
normal, American family.

401
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,428
[Spot growling]

402
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,064
Eddie,
I think Spot's hungry.

403
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,706
You may give him
something from the table.

404
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,300
Okay, Mom.

405
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,212
Here, Spot.

406
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,839
[Spot growling]
