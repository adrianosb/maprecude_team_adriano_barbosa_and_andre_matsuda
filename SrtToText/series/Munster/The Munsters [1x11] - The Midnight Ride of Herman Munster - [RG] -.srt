00:00:08,288 --> 00:00:10,848
[Yawning]

2
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:18,262
Herman, honey, did you enjoy
the movie tonight?

3
00:00:18,332 --> 00:00:20,562
Oh, it was fine, dear.
Just fine.

4
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:23,762
[Yawning]
But you know, Lily,

5
00:00:23,837 --> 00:00:26,931
I don't think
everybody at the drive-in
cared for the picture.

6
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:29,532
When I got out of the car
to get some refreshments,

7
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,873
I noticed people
leaving in droves.

8
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:33,913
I noticed that too.

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,313
Why, some of them
even drove right out
through the fence to get out.

10
00:00:37,384 --> 00:00:39,875
And did you see
those head-on collisions?

11
00:00:40,954 --> 00:00:43,479
Well, that's showbiz.

12
00:00:43,557 --> 00:00:45,548
[Yawning]

13
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,994
Lily, I'm awfully tired tonight.

14
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:55,000
I think I'll go up to bed.

15
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:57,798
Oh. So early, dear?
It's only 2:00 in the morning.

16
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:00,032
Well, I haven't been sleeping
too well lately.

17
00:01:00,107 --> 00:01:03,599
For the past few days,
I've been tossing and turning
all afternoon.

18
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:05,611
[Gasps]
Herman!

19
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:09,171
Oh, I left my fur coat
out in the backseat of the car.

20
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:11,911
Before you go to bed,
would you be a dear
and bring it in?

21
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:15,386
But, Lily, I'm...
Oh, come on, Herman.

22
00:01:15,455 --> 00:01:19,619
I don't want to lose it.
It's my new wolf-dyed mink.

23
00:01:19,693 --> 00:01:24,426
All right, dear.
But I'm... I'm dead on my feet.

24
00:01:34,074 --> 00:01:36,508
[Wind Whistling]

25
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:42,437
[Yawning]

26
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:01,601
Hey, it sure got windy
all of a sudden.

27
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:03,602
Yeah.

28
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:06,697
Freddie.
What?

29
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:08,968
I think we found one.
Hey, you're right, Al.

30
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:11,943
This is the perfect getaway car
for that bank job tonight.

31
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:15,345
And the keys are in it.
Let's go.

32
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,087
[Stomping]
Grandpa!

33
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:33,924
Grandpa,
are you down there?

34
00:03:33,994 --> 00:03:35,928
[Door Creaks]

35
00:03:35,996 --> 00:03:39,864
What is it, Lily?
I'm in the middle
of a very big experiment.

36
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,026
Grandpa, listen.
Twenty minutes ago,

37
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:44,502
Herman went to the car
to get my coat.

38
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:47,540
I just looked out front
and both he and the car are gone.

39
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:50,838
Don't worry, Lily.
Why, when I was younger
in the Old Country,

40
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:54,108
I was always disappearing
in the middle of the night.

41
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,048
Of course, that was before
I got rheumatism in my wings.

42
00:03:58,118 --> 00:04:03,886
Grandpa, I hope Herman
didn't get any ideas
from the movie we saw tonight.

43
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:07,688
In the picture,
David Niven leaves his wife...

44
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:09,922
to chase after Tuesday Weld.

45
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:12,692
Oh, Lily,
it's nothing like that.

46
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:16,224
Why, Herman loves you
from the bottom of his hearts.

47
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:22,030
Of course.
Of course, you're right.

48
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,235
You're right, Grandpa.

49
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:27,508
I know Herman loves me.
But where is he?

50
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:30,448
What could possibly make a man
leave his happy home?

51
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:32,576
Tuesday Weld.
Tuesday Weld.

52
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:35,212
[Wolf Whistle]

53
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:38,951
If there's anything I can't stand,
it's a bigmouthed raven.

54
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,734
Hey, Al, where we gonna
pick up Marty?

55
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:52,169
You know, the farmhouse.
Then we all take off
together from there.

56
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:54,172
Oh, yeah.

57
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:59,942
[Snoring]

58
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:04,245
Hey, Freddie,
wake up, will ya?
I am awake.

59
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:06,649
So how come
you just snored?
I didn't snore.

60
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,382
How do you know?
'Cause I'm awake.

61
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:12,254
I know I'm awake 'cause
I can hear myself talking.
When I'm sleeping,

62
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:15,089
I don't hear myself talk on account
I never say nothing unless I'm awake.

63
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:17,322
So if I'm awake,
how could I have snored?

64
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:20,093
Freddie, do me a favor,
will ya?
Yeah?

65
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,134
Go back to sleep.

66
00:05:26,006 --> 00:05:28,998
[Snoring]

67
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:37,476
You mean he just disappeared,
Aunt Lily?

68
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,781
Oh, yes, Marilyn.
And it's not like Herman.

69
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:43,015
He's such a homebody.

70
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,856
What's all the excitement?
Did Grandpa blow himself up again?

71
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:50,293
[Laughs]
Of course not.

72
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:53,230
We can't have fun and games
all the time.

73
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:55,392
Eddie, this doesn't concern you.

74
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:58,198
Marilyn, will you
take him back upstairs
and put him to bed?

75
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:01,138
Come on, Eddie.
But gee, I wanna hear
what's going on.

76
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:03,402
Is it okay if I leave the lid open?

77
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:05,671
We'll see, Eddie.

78
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:08,839
Is it okay if I leave
the top half of the lid open?

79
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:16,321
[Creaking]

80
00:06:21,795 --> 00:06:23,956
Lily, who are you phoning?

81
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,090
Well, I'm not gonna just sit by
and... and do nothing.

82
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:29,567
- I'm gonna call the police.
- The police?

83
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:32,298
But, Lily, this is not necessary.

84
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:36,604
Hello? I'd like
the Missing Persons Bureau, please.

85
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:39,270
Yes. This is Mrs. Herman Munster.

86
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:41,575
I'd like to report a missing person.

87
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:45,140
Yes, it's my husband.
He disappeared this evening.

88
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:48,051
Yes, ma'am, Mrs. Munster.
Could I have his description, please?

89
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:52,421
Well, he's about seven feet tall
and weighs 380 pounds.

90
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:56,258
Seven feet, three hundred and eight...
380 pounds.

91
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:58,820
Well, you see, he's been
on a diet lately.

92
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:02,129
- Age?
- Uh... Oh, just one moment, please.

93
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:05,194
Grandpa, how old is Herman?
I keep forgetting.

94
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:10,402
Well, they started working on him
right after the War of 1812.

95
00:07:10,477 --> 00:07:15,414
They ran into a shortage of parts
at the medical school.

96
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:19,418
I'd say they sewed up the job
around 1850.

97
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:21,784
Just put down middle-aged.

98
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:25,590
Any distinguishing characteristics?

99
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:27,956
No, nothing unusual.

100
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:30,996
You'd never even notice him
if you met him on the street.

101
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,728
- Eyes?
- Two.

102
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:38,737
There wasn't room
for any more.

103
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:41,069
I mean, what color?

104
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:45,578
Oh, oh, well, one's brown
and one's chartreuse.

105
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:48,409
They thought it would match
his complexion.

106
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:51,382
- Visible scars?
- No.

107
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:55,148
He has a...
He has a lovely beauty mark
on his forehead though.

108
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:59,590
It's about five inches long,
and it's shaped like
a bolt of lightning.

109
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:02,355
Lily, tell him our address.
Our address!

110
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:06,262
Oh, yes, yes. We live at
1313 Mockingbird Lane.

111
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:11,133
And-And please, please call me
when you learn anything.
I'm awfully worried.

112
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:15,504
You see, he left the house
in a... in a sort of a daze.

113
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:18,669
Yes, ma'am.
We'll get right on it.

114
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,114
Benson?
Yes, Sergeant.

115
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:27,347
Get out a 106 on a Herman Munster.
The Mockingbird Heights vicinity.

116
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,355
What's up?
Well, his wife just called in.

117
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:32,618
But she was so hysterical,
the description's kind of wild.

118
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:37,459
Just make it, uh...
Make it a tall, heavyset male
with a sallow complexion.

119
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,397
May be suffering from amnesia.

120
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:46,995
Grandpa, they're going
to send out a bulletin,

121
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:49,667
but don't you think
we ought to call the morgue?

122
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:55,237
No, Lily. I think Herman was too sleepy
to go and visit anybody.

123
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:10,095
Hey, Al, look.
The Big Dipper.

124
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:12,097
Where? Oh, come on.
Let's get in there.

125
00:09:12,165 --> 00:09:14,099
Hey, listen.
I hope we're not late.

126
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:16,101
Marty always works me over
when we're late.

127
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:20,265
Wise up, will ya?
That means he likes ya.
Come on.

128
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,274
Hey, listen, Al.
Yeah?

129
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:24,276
Are you sure the car's
gonna be all right out there?

130
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:26,278
Sure. Nobody's
gonna steal a car.

131
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:28,678
How many times
do I have to tell you?

132
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:31,478
People are basically honest.

133
00:09:37,824 --> 00:09:40,156
Hey, uh, we heisted a car.

134
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:43,059
Got here as soon
as we could, Marty.
Yeah, Marty, yeah.

135
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:45,529
Now we're waiting
for some big guy
the boss is sending over.

136
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:47,532
His name is Big Louie.

137
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,693
He's gonna drive the car
on the bank job...

138
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:52,033
and flatten anybody
who gets in our way.

139
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:54,369
Hey, this is just like them
George Raft pictures on television.

140
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,465
Ah, shut up, will ya?

141
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:59,670
So, why don't you deal, huh?
All right.

142
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:03,546
[Wolf Howling]

143
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:21,098
[Wolf Howling]

144
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:24,933
Hey, Marty, who's this
Big Louie anyway?

145
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:26,938
I don't know.
I've never seen him before.

146
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:30,737
But he's a great big goon.
Supposed to be a regular monster.

147
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:37,681
Oh, yeah, the boss says
he's an ex-fighter.

148
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,184
He's punchy
from 20 years in the ring.

149
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:44,553
Twenty years in the ring?
[Knocking]

150
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:46,990
That's probably him now.

151
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:02,938
Uh, excuse me,
but I seem to be lost.

152
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:05,773
You're not lost.
This is the place.
Get in here.

153
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:07,904
Uh, oh, no.
Maybe you don't understand.

154
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:10,814
You see my wife's coat...
Get in...

155
00:11:14,587 --> 00:11:17,317
Uh, will you please
get in here?

156
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,654
Well,
[Laughs]

157
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:23,218
Uh, now that you
put it that way.

158
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:25,958
You're late.
Late?

159
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:28,466
Yeah, come on, you.
Let's get going.

160
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:32,561
Oh, I'm terribly sorry,
but I couldn't go anywhere
with you gentlemen.

161
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:36,005
Listen, you.
Nobody chickens out
in this outfit, see?

162
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:40,102
[Giggles]
Please, please,
I'm very ticklish.

163
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:42,943
Will you stop the clownin'
before I blow holes in you?
Now come on.

164
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:46,117
Gracious.

165
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:52,123
Hmm. A lot of rude people
in this world.

166
00:11:54,894 --> 00:11:57,158
Let's go, Louie.
Step on it.

167
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:03,001
Boy, that Big Louie's
the toughest-looking hatchet man
I ever seen.

168
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:05,003
Yeah, boy, is he punchy.

169
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:07,665
How'd he get a face like that?
From only 20 years in the ring?

170
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,833
Come on, Louie.
There's work to be done.

171
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:19,711
Gracious. I'd really
rather not, gentlemen,
but if you insist.

172
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:41,336
Hey, did anything escape
from the zoo tonight?

173
00:12:41,407 --> 00:12:43,602
No, but he kinda fits
that 106 we got.

174
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:46,236
"Herman Munster...
tall, heavyset, male,
sallow complexion."

175
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:48,246
Well, let's check him out.

176
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,924
Looking for something, mister?

177
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:03,553
Well, yeah.
I'm looking for an address.
What street do you want?

178
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:06,257
Well, uh, what street you got?

179
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:10,325
What do you think?
Fits the description.
Says "a possible amnesia victim."

180
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:12,530
Yeah, that's Herman Munster.

181
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:16,041
Looks like this amnesia victim
forgot when to put the bottle down.

182
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:21,080
Why don't you get in with us, mister.
I think we know just the address you want.

183
00:13:21,147 --> 00:13:23,240
Oh, don't mind if I do.

184
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:26,615
You know something?
I never got this kind of service
in Kansas City.

185
00:13:26,686 --> 00:13:28,620
Thank you.

186
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:40,794
Lily, we've been driving
around for hours,

187
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:42,858
and there's just
no sign of Herman.

188
00:13:42,935 --> 00:13:44,960
Maybe we should have
waited at home for him.

189
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:47,562
Oh, no, no.
The police never called back.

190
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,665
We simply must
keep on looking.

191
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:52,370
Poor Herman,
he's so helpless.

192
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:56,779
There's a phone, Aunt Lily.
Maybe you could call the police
and see if they've learned anything.

193
00:13:56,849 --> 00:13:59,340
That's a good idea, Marilyn.

194
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:06,691
Gee, I wonder where Pop is.

195
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:09,557
Oh, Eddie, we should have
left you home in bed.

196
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:13,463
What for?
You know I can't go to sleep
till it's light out.

197
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,467
Really?

198
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:19,494
Oh, well... well, thank you.
Th-Thank you.

199

Marilyn. Grandpa.
Guess what.

200
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,515
The police picked up Herman
a half hour ago.

201
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,518
The poor dear
was walking the streets in a daze.

202
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:38,353
Where is he now?
Well, he was so groggy
from lack of sleep...

203
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:41,689
that they took him to our house
and put him to bed.

204
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:43,490
They thought he'd been drinking.

205
00:14:43,563 --> 00:14:46,862
Can you imagine?
Why, that's ridiculous.

206
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:49,993
And that policeman
made another odd remark.

207
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:52,833
He said something about
our house looking spooky.

208
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:56,204
Hmm. Well, there's
just no accounting for taste.

209
00:14:56,275 --> 00:15:00,371
As long as Herman is back in bed,
why don't we head on home?

210
00:15:00,446 --> 00:15:03,210
You know, Herman must have
really been in a daze.

211
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:06,718
They said he kept insisting
that his name was Louie.

212
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,501
Keep driving straight,
then turn onto State Street.

213
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:31,509
Gentlemen, if-if you'll only
allow me to phone my wife.

214
00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:33,670
She must be very worried
about me.

215
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:36,010
Louie, will you knock it off
and do what you're told?

216
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:38,016
Yeah, knock it off.

217
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:41,815
Pull over there on the right.
Uh, but, Mr. Marty,
that's a bank.

218
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:44,515
I don't believe
it's open this early.

219
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,024

Pull over there, Louie.

take a look in the bedroom.

302
00:21:22,895 --> 00:21:24,829
[Stairway Creaking]

303
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:29,431
[Snoring]

304
00:21:39,545 --> 00:21:42,946
Herman? Herman?

305
00:21:43,015 --> 00:21:46,849
- Uh, what? [Screams]
- [Screams] It isn't Herman!

306
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,083
I know... I must have died,
and they sent me to the bad place.

307
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:54,250
Grandpa, there's someone
sleeping in my bed.

308
00:21:54,326 --> 00:21:56,954
Who is it?

309
00:21:58,297 --> 00:22:00,390
It ain't Goldilocks.

310
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:04,732
This must be Brimstone City,
a-and you're the devil!

311
00:22:04,803 --> 00:22:09,797
Hippity-bippity, rinkety-dink,
make like a statue
and freeze, you fink!

312
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:12,241
[Laughing]
That'll hold him.

313
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:14,905
Come on, Grandpa.
I'm gonna get the police
on the phone again.

314
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,346
Help.! Help.!
Let me down.!

315
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:20,283
Don't go away.
Help.! Let me down.!

316
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:25,921
Oh, Grandpa, do you suppose
Herman really was in an accident?

317
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:29,358
Now, Lily, don't get upset
until you've seen him.

318
00:22:29,428 --> 00:22:33,626
After all, you know that
the police have been mistaken
about Herman before.

319
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:35,667
I suppose you're right,
Grandpa.

320
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:39,727
Last time Herman fell asleep
in the park, we had to pick him up
at the mortuary.

321
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:46,310
[Lock Clicks]

322
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:54,081
Oh, Herman,
it's so wonderful
to have you back.

323
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:56,280
Thank you, dear.
Oh, uh, Herman.

324
00:22:56,355 --> 00:23:00,917
Um, I was so worried, I reported you
to the Missing Persons Bureau.

325
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:04,793
They brought around some big lunk
who calls himself Big Louie.

326
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:07,388
Grandpa has him frozen
in the bedroom.

327
00:23:07,466 --> 00:23:09,400
Big Louie?
Shh!

328
00:23:09,468 --> 00:23:12,528
I told the police to wait,
and I'd bring him right down.

329
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:16,335
Do you know something?
Those crooks tonight
kept calling me Louie.

330
00:23:16,408 --> 00:23:19,104
I'll bet that's the man
they were waiting for
when I showed up.

331
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:21,146
I'll go and get him.

332
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:24,206
[Keys Clattering]

333
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:33,187
Okay, Louie, unfreeze.

334
00:23:33,258 --> 00:23:37,251
[Clears Throat]
Come on, already. Defrost.!

335
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:40,230
What are those magic words?
Alakazam!

336
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,530
Abracadabra.!

337
00:23:43,602 --> 00:23:46,469
Oh, fiddlesticks!

338
00:23:50,743 --> 00:23:52,711
Uh, what round is it?

339
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:55,144
Never mind that, Louie.

340
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:57,478
Just come with me.

341
00:23:57,549 --> 00:24:00,541
You're a good boy.
We'll get you all nice and neat.

342
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:03,884
I like you.
We have a lot of people
downstairs for you to meet.

343
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:05,890
I've never had such a drive
in my life.

344
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,892
At one point,
I was driving down the street...

345
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,451
Come right downstairs
to the police.
We'll probably get a reward.

346
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:13,726
Let's go, Louie.
Come on.

347
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,030
[Both Yell]

348
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:20,367
Where's my manager?
I was fouled.
I wanna get outta here.

349
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:25,236
What a frightening person.

350
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,244
You're right.

351
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:31,544
Can you imagine anyone
mistaking him for my big,
sweet, handsome husband?

352
00:24:31,617 --> 00:24:34,484
Oh, Lily.
Oh, Herman.

353
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:37,147
You're blushing.

354
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:39,156
Really?
Yes.

355
00:24:39,224 --> 00:24:43,024
You're turning the most
adorable shade of green.
