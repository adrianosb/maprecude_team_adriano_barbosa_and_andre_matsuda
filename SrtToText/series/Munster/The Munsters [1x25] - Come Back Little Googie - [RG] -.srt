155
00:10:35,848 --> 00:10:38,442
Grandpa, I don't think
Lily's gonna like this.

156
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:42,454
Herman, please.
I just wanna teach
this little fellow a lesson.

157
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:46,390
That when his elders
say they can do something,
they mean it. Herman.

158
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:49,019
I'm ready, sir.
Very good, Googie.

159
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:51,825
Now just sit perfectly still.

[Laughs]
Googie is now a bunny rabbit.

162
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:06,368
Now we shall meet
the new Googie.

163
00:11:18,524 --> 00:11:20,685
That's not a rabbit.

164
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,820
A rabbit has longer ears.

165
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:28,333
Gee, Grandpa, that's
the neatest-lookin' trick I ever saw.

166
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:32,337
- Now turn him back.
- Yeah, sure.

167
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:36,869
You know, Grandpa,
you really outdid yourself.

168
00:11:36,943 --> 00:11:39,241
It's a distinct improvement.

169
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,871
Hi, Googie. Hi.

170
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:46,851
Eddie, why don't you
go in the house?
I'm trying to concentrate.

171
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,786
Okay. Good-bye, Googie.

172
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:52,290
Hey, Herman.
Uh, please.

173
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,226
Sit right there, Googie.

174
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:58,286
Don't move.

175
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:01,299
Herman, please!

Alacazamo alacazoy.

177
00:12:06,806 --> 00:12:09,434
Turn back to a little boy.

178
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:11,534
Now, let's see.

179
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,974
What's the matter?
I don't know.

180
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,280
The brat won't un-monkey.

181
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,215
Grandpa, you gotta do something soon.

182
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,485
If Lily finds out,
she'll be upset.

183
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,825
Quiet, Herman.
I'm getting ready.
[Chittering]

184
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:33,058
He'll be right with you, fella.

185
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:39,061
Stand back. Stand back.

186
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:45,068
I'm going to use number XL-438.

187
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:49,376
This is the one that took
Abraham Lincoln out of that log cabin...

188
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:52,714
and put him in the White House.

[Trilling The "R"]
Raymond Massey.

192
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:06,857
[Laughs]
I did it. I did it.

193
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:09,299
Herman, help me up.
I know it worked.

194
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:13,429
It takes a lot out of me,
but it always works.
[Chuckles]

195
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,170
[Chittering]

196
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:19,871
Herman, I blew the bit.

197
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:22,107
Come on. Come on.

198
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:26,713
There's only one thing to do,
and you've gotta do it immediately.

199
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:28,720
What is it, Herman?

200
00:13:28,788 --> 00:13:33,555
Go down to the market and
lay in a big supply of bananas.

201
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:42,027
He thinks he changed me
into a monkey. This is great.

202
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:48,236
There you are, Googie.
It's all yours.
Eddie?

203
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:51,003
Would you please go
and play somewhere? Please?

204
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:53,637
But I wanna watch you change
Googie back to Googie.

205
00:13:53,713 --> 00:13:56,807
Eddie, your grandfather's busy.

206
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:59,113
Will you go upstairs and play?

207
00:13:59,185 --> 00:14:03,485
Okay, but I never get
to see any neat stuff.

208
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:09,027
How are you doing?

209
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:13,361
Well, according
to my calculations here,

210
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:17,528
if we wait 30,000 years,
evolution just might help
solve the problem.

211
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:21,630
Grandpa, Googie's gotta be back
in school on Monday.

212
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:25,110
Why don't you turn him
into a frog?

213
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:28,511
And then turn the frog into a prince?

214
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:31,141
And then turn the prince
back into Googie?

215
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:36,285
No, I've been working on that
frog-prince formula for five years.

216
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:40,314
And all I got to show for it
is a velvet suit and 400 sick frogs.

217
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:49,535
[Googie]
Eddie, psst.
Hey, Eddie, come here.

218
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:58,440
Googie! What are you doing here?

219
00:14:58,511 --> 00:15:01,503
I just left you in the lab
eating a banana.
That wasn't me.

220
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:03,776
That was Chimpo. I borrowed him
from the pet shop.

221
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:06,181
That's the big joke I wanted
to play on your old grandpa.

222
00:15:06,252 --> 00:15:09,346
Well, that's a dirty trick.
And I'm gonna go tell him
what you did right now.

223
00:15:09,422 --> 00:15:12,050
All right, Eddie.
You go in there and do that.

224
00:15:12,124 --> 00:15:14,285
And do you know what
I'm gonna do?
What?

225
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,261
I'm going in there and tell your parents
this whole thing was your idea,

226
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,355
and you made me
get the chimp and everything.

227
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:21,730
- Would you really do that?
- Sure I would.

228
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:26,170
Now you and me are gonna
hide out at the movies and really
drive them out of their skulls.

229
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:28,298
Okay, I guess I gotta.

230
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:30,433
But you're the meanest kid
I ever knew.

231
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:34,878
You're a rat and a rat fink
and a miserable little brat.

232
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:39,008
Gee, thanks, Eddie.
My analyst said what
I needed was recognition.

233
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:44,718
All right.
Yes, I'll tell my Aunt Lily right now.

234
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:51,959
Marilyn, who was that
on the phone?

235
00:15:52,031 --> 00:15:55,489
Googie's mother.
It seems they have some
relatives coming tonight,

236
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:58,628
and they'd like it if he could come home
just as soon as possible.

237
00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:01,298
Well, that's a lucky break.

238
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:03,604
Now we can get rid
of the little darling.

239
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:07,737
I think Grandpa and Herman
are amusing him in the lab.

240
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:14,209
[Lily]
Herman.!

241
00:16:15,655 --> 00:16:17,646
Yes... Yes, dear?

242
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:20,317
Is Googie down there?

243
00:16:20,393 --> 00:16:23,055
Oh, he's here, all right.

244
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:25,063
Well, Mrs. Miller phoned.

245
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:29,067
They're having company and
they want us to bring him home
as soon as we can.

246
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:33,697
- Bring him home, Lily?
- Yes, dear. I want you to take him over.

247
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:36,901
Marilyn and I have to go
to the market before it closes.

248
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:40,839
All right, dear.

249
00:16:40,913 --> 00:16:43,313
Is everything all right
down there?

250
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:47,648
Fine! We're having more fun
than a barrel of monkeys.

251
00:16:50,523 --> 00:16:53,515
What did you have to go
and say that for?

252
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:56,459
I don't know.
I just went "ape."

253
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:59,965
Herman, will you cut that out!
We're in big trouble here.

254
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,796
Wait a minute.
I have an idea.

255
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:05,837
Is Googie's suitcase
still up in his room?

256
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:08,567
Sure, but...
Listen.

257
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:12,506
Here's what we do.

258
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:15,706
Grandpa, I have the car
out front. Hurry up!

259
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:20,377
Quiet, Herman!
Oh, I sure hope this works, Herman.
[Chittering]

260
00:17:21,987 --> 00:17:24,854
Come on, Googie. Come on.

261
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:27,950
We're all going home now.

262
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:31,827
Oh, don't you look nice.
Oh, boy.

263
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,999
It's dark outside.
Chances are his parents
won't notice the difference.

264
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:44,073
What a day!
I sure got up on the wrong side
of the slab this morning.

265
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:46,805
Come on, Herman!
Let's get out of here!

266
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:54,084
Herman! Grandpa! We're home!

267
00:17:55,855 --> 00:17:57,982
Uncle Herman?

268
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:00,048
Grandpa?

269
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,925
They're not here.

270
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:07,125
I guess they're delivering
Eddie's little friend
back to his parents.

271
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:09,690
Oh, thank goodness.

272
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:12,101
What an annoying weekend.

273
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:16,073
Well, when they drop
little Googie off at the Millers,
our troubles will be over.

274
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:23,140
Okay, Herman,
this is the number. Let's go.

275
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:26,412
All right, but let's not get into
a big conversation with the Millers.

276
00:18:26,485 --> 00:18:30,512
Big conversation?
All I'm gonna do is ring the bell,
leave the kid and we'll fly.

277
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:33,353
You wait here.
Come on, Googie.

278
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,404
[Doorbell Chiming]

279
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:49,873
Oh, Googie. Look what
you did to your jacket.

280
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:55,275
Yes?
We brought your son home,
Mr. Miller.

281
00:18:55,347 --> 00:18:57,406
He's a great boy. We loved
having him. Good night.

282
00:18:57,483 --> 00:19:00,213
Thank you,
but won't you come in?
No, thanks.

283
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:02,652
We have to run.
Yes, we have to run.

284
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:04,848
Good night.
Good night.

285
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:09,917
Googie, where are your manners?
You didn't even say good night.

286
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:16,762
[Chittering]
Googie.!

287
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:21,271
Come back here, you two!
What have you done to my boy?

288
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,365
Grandpa, I think he noticed
the difference.

289
00:19:23,442 --> 00:19:26,343
Come on, you big dummy.
Let's head for the car.

290
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:28,346
Stop! Come back!

291
00:19:28,414 --> 00:19:30,405
Help.!

292
00:19:34,553 --> 00:19:37,886
Yes, Mr. Miller,
this is Mrs. Munster.

293
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:41,984
But I can't understand you, sir,
unless you stop screaming.

294
00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:45,197
Monkey?

295
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:47,357
I really don't understand.

296
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:51,665
All I know is that my husband
left to take your little boy home...

297
00:19:52,738 --> 00:19:55,707
Hi, Mom.
Hello, Mrs. Munster.

298
00:19:57,176 --> 00:20:00,304
- We were at the movies.
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Miller,

299
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:02,313
but your son just walked in.

300
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:05,976
We'll bring him right...
Oh, you will?

301
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:08,451
All right, we'll have him ready.

302
00:20:12,324 --> 00:20:15,919
Eddie, you should have told us
if you were going to the movies.

303
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:19,988
And, Googie, your father
is so upset he's incoherent.

304
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:24,729
Now your parents are expecting
relatives, and your father is coming
right over to get you.

305
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:28,466
So you run on upstairs
and get ready.
Yes, ma'am.

306
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:32,443
Aunt Lily?

307
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:35,412
I thought Uncle Herman
took Googie home.

308
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:39,417
I don't know how he's done it,
but he's goofed it again.

309
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:53,456
Grandpa, I'm scared.
That strange car out front.

310
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:55,966
After what we did with Googie,
do you suppose it's the police?

311
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:58,526
Well, it's either that
or the S.P.C.A.

312
00:20:58,604 --> 00:21:01,630
Come on. We've gotta
get to the dungeon.

313
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:26,954
Herman, we can lock ourselves
in the dungeon...

314
00:21:27,032 --> 00:21:30,524
for 20 or 30 years
till this thing blows over.

315
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:33,265
Oh. If we're gonna
be there that long,

316
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:36,001
I'll need a change of socks.

317
00:21:36,075 --> 00:21:38,043
Herman, please!

318
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,944
Mrs. Munster, I can't tell you
what a shock this whole thing
has been to me.

319
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:44,642
Well, Mr. Miller,
everything is all right now.

320
00:21:44,717 --> 00:21:47,481
And you can take him back home
to see his relatives.

321
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:49,748
Oh.

322
00:21:49,822 --> 00:21:52,347
They just came back
for his suitcase.

323
00:21:52,424 --> 00:21:56,417
I guess when they got
a good look at him,
they liked him better as a monkey.

324
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:01,957
Hey! Hey!

325
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:05,834
He's not a monkey anymore.
He's changed back to a kid.

326
00:22:06,939 --> 00:22:11,137
Boy, that Abraham Lincoln bit
must have had a delayed fuse on it.

327
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,440
Grandpa, we're in the clear.

328
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:18,505
Well, like I said,
I've got company coming.
So I've got to get going.

329
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:20,518
That's right.
I understand.

330
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:23,350
Would you mind coming outside
for a minute, please?

331
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,693
A monkey?

332
00:22:30,763 --> 00:22:32,697
Yes, it's a little present for you.

333
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:36,963
Some wise guy in white tie
and tails left it at my house.

334
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:39,266
White tie and tails?

335
00:22:39,338 --> 00:22:42,034
I think I know who that is.

336
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:44,473
Well, good night, Mr. Miller.
Good night.

337
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:46,534
[Googie]
Good night.

338
00:22:53,218 --> 00:22:57,552
Herman, Grandpa,

339
00:22:57,623 --> 00:22:59,557
kindly explain this.

340
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:04,729
He's changed back again.

341
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:07,322
Oh, no.

342
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:18,768
And I wanted to tell you that the
monkey came from the pet store,
but Googie wouldn't let me.

343
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:22,473
- He said it was a funny joke.
- Eddie, it's not a funny joke...

344
00:23:22,548 --> 00:23:26,416
when it's at the expense of your poor,
old, broken-down grandfather.

345
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:28,419
Thank you, Herman.

346
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:30,887
Eddie, you're getting off
very easy.

347
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:33,925
Why, back in the Old Country,
if I had done something like this,

348
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:36,517
my father would have
bit my head off.

349
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:38,529
Gee, I'm sorry.

350
00:23:38,597 --> 00:23:42,499
If you go with bad companions,
some of it is bound to rub off on you.

351
00:23:42,568 --> 00:23:48,097
Exactly. Which brings to mind
a famous old quotation...

352
00:23:48,173 --> 00:23:50,698
"He who lies down with dog,

353
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:53,108
gets up with fleas."

354
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:55,442
- Who said that, Daddy?
- I'm not sure.

355
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:57,778
I think it was the man
who trains Lassie.

356
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:01,115
Well, I agree.
Eddie should be punished.

357
00:24:01,186 --> 00:24:04,451
Oh, but I hate to see
that awful Googie get away with this.

358
00:24:04,523 --> 00:24:06,855
Marilyn, he shan't.

359
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:10,452
Tomorrow morning, I'm going over
to Mr. Miller's and tell him
what his boy has done,

360
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:14,295
and point out to him that
he has neglected his duty as a father.

361
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:17,460
I'm also gonna give him
the benefit of my vast experience...

362
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:19,470
as a parent and a human being.

363
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:22,063
Thank you.

364
00:24:22,141 --> 00:24:25,372
Herman, why don't you just
telephone him and tell him now?

365
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:28,709
No, Lily. I wanna meet him
face-to-face,

366
00:24:28,781 --> 00:24:31,272
so he can get the full impact.

367
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:37,247
[Chittering]

368
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:41,088
[Squawking]

369
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:45,359
[Door Opens]

370
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,364
[Door Closes]
Hmm.

371
00:24:47,432 --> 00:24:50,833
That little fella is sure
in a hurry to get back
to the pet store.
