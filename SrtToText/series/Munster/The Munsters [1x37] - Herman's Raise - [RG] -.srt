1
00:00:12,893 --> 00:00:15,726
Hey, Mom? Where's Pop?
I wanna say good night to him.

2
00:00:15,796 --> 00:00:19,027
He's not home yet, Eddie.
He's working late at the parlor.

3
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:22,500
Why can't he get home on time
like other guys' fathers?

4
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:27,268
Now Eddie, you have to understand.
In his business, a lot of things
won't keep till tomorrow.

5
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:31,600
Good night.
Good night.

6
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:34,511
It's a shame Uncle Herman
has to work this hard.

7
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:36,742
They certainly take advantage of him
down there.

8
00:00:36,817 --> 00:00:41,277
Well, that's because
he's so conscientious
and faithful and loyal and...

9
00:00:41,355 --> 00:00:43,289
What's that word?

10
00:00:43,357 --> 00:00:47,191
- Stupid.
- He is not.

11
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,195
He sure is stupid.
He's a big lummox...

12
00:00:50,263 --> 00:00:52,731
I don't see any reason
why you should talk like that
about Herman.

13
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,825
Grandpa, how can you say that
about Uncle Herman?
[Door Closes]

14
00:00:56,937 --> 00:01:01,306
- Hi.
- [Lunch Box Thuds On Table]

15
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:04,003
Why don't you
go on talking?

16
00:01:06,313 --> 00:01:10,215
Why did you...
Why did you stop talking
when I came in?

17
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:12,581
[Stammering]
Never mind, Herman.

18
00:01:12,652 --> 00:01:17,885
Well, when I come into a room,
and everybody suddenly
stops talking, it irks me.

19
00:01:20,627 --> 00:01:24,188
It even makes me madder than
when you start spelling out stuff.

20
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:27,825
We were just all upset
about you working so hard.

21
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:31,894
Yes, dear,
and for such a low salary.

22
00:01:31,972 --> 00:01:36,136
Do you know what
you're going to do
first thing tomorrow morning?

23
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:41,545
Why, of course I do.
I'm gonna wake up.
[Laughs]

24
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:46,814
You are going to wake up,
and you're going to march straight
into your boss, Mr. Gateman's office,

25
00:01:46,887 --> 00:01:50,254
and demand a raise in pay.
Lily's right, Herman.

26
00:01:50,323 --> 00:01:53,053
Down at the parlor,
why should you take things lying down?

27
00:01:55,562 --> 00:01:57,894
Well, gee, I don't know.

28
00:01:57,964 --> 00:02:02,401
[Clicks Tongue]
I mean, I can't impose
on Mr. Gateman.

29
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:04,596
He's been so kind to me.

30
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:08,437
He sent me that get-well card
when I was hit by
that diesel locomotive.

31
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:12,171
At Christmastime, he sent me
that big basket of rotten fruit
from California.

32
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:15,305
It was so thoughtful of him;
I ate it all.

33
00:02:15,382 --> 00:02:17,714
Now listen, Herman.

34
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:20,514
You're going to look Mr. Gateman
straight in the eye.

35
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:24,921
You're going to pound on his desk,
and you're going to ask for
a raise in pay.

36
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:27,721
You're gonna be
a regular tiger!

37
00:02:27,794 --> 00:02:31,457
Well, all right,
if you say so, dear.

38
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:35,695
I'll be a tiger.

[Screams]

43
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:16,629
Grandpa,
don't scare a fella like that!

44
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:20,867
Never mind that. What are you doing
sneaking home in the middle of the day?

45
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:23,774
I was just hiding outside
till Lily left the house.

46
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:28,007
What happened with
Mr. Gateman?
I did just like Lily said.

47
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:32,848
I marched into his office.
I pounded on his desk,
looked him straight in the eye,

48
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,411
told him what a faithful employee
I'd been and demanded a raise.

49
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:39,652
And, Grandpa, guess what?
He fired you.

50
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:42,217
How did you guess?

51
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:45,128
'Cause I know my son-in-law.

52
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:49,931
You're a hard-luck guy.
If you found the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow,

53
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:52,494
there'd be a tax collector
sitting on the lid.

54
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:55,871
What am I gonna tell Lily?
She's been counting on a raise,

55
00:04:55,942 --> 00:05:00,743
and if she finds out I've been fired,
she might get mad at me
and stamp on the floor...

56
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:04,978
and say mean things to me
and shake her finger at me.

57
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:09,215
She might even break
my Huckleberry Hound records.

58
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:17,223
Now listen, Herman, you're a grown man,
and you're going to handle this
in an adult manner.

59
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:22,758
You're gonna do what every
red-blooded American husband does
in a case like this.

60
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:24,770
Don't tell your wife a thing.

61
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,102
Well, Herman,

62
00:05:30,176 --> 00:05:34,442
all through dinner
you haven't said a word about
what happened at the parlor today.

63
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:38,177
[Clears Throat]
Oh, uh, we were quite busy.

64
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:40,583
In fact,
we had a quite a turnover.
[Chuckles]

65
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:44,556
I mean about your interview
with Mr. Gateman.
Oh, that.

66
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:47,650
We're so anxious, Uncle Herman.
Did he talk to you?

67
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:51,891
Oh, yes,
he, uh, talked to me.

68
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:56,902
Well, is he going to
give you a raise or isn't he?

69
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,803
Well, you see, dear,
Mr. Gateman is a rather busy man.

70
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:03,570
I think he wants to take the idea
and sort of, uh, throw it down the well.

71
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:09,138
- Throw it down the well?
- You know, throw it down the well
and see if anyone salutes it.

72
00:06:09,215 --> 00:06:11,376
What kind of double-talk is that?

73
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:14,113
Well, you know, Lily,
he wants to take the idea
and run it up the flagpole...

74
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:16,849
and see if it makes a splash.

75
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:21,087
All businessmen have expressions
like that to keep outsiders
from finding out...

76
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:23,652
that they really don't know
what they're talking about.

77
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:28,490
Well, I think Mr. Gateman
is giving you the runaround.

78
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:33,562
He may want to think it over,
but I want an answer
by the end of the week.

79
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,599
Well, I think you'll have an answer
by the end of the week...
if not sooner.

80
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:42,011
Marilyn, Eddie,
come and help me
take out the dishes.

81
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:55,318
Whew! Boy, Herman,
that was close.

82
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:58,228
But at least you've got
till the end of the week.

83
00:06:58,298 --> 00:07:00,289
I'll tell you what, Grandpa.

84
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:04,132
I figure I'll leave the house
every day as if
I was going to the parlor...

85
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:07,196
and not break the news to Lily
until I get a new job.

86
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:11,266
Oh, I see.
You wanna keep the news from her
as long as you can.

87
00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:16,839
Right. As we say in business,
let's not start scratching till
we know where the fleas are biting.

Of course,
I've always been a hog for work.

[Laughing]

95
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:24,670
Herman, it's been a week since
you spoke to Mr. Gateman.

96
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:28,908
Do you think I'll have
a little surprise tonight
when I open your pay envelope?

97
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:31,712
Oh, yes, I think you'll have
quite a surprise.

98
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:35,276
Oh, I just know
it's going to be
a real nice, big raise.

99
00:09:35,355 --> 00:09:39,689
Well, Mr. Gateman
should appreciate
all the hard work you've done.

100
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,092
After all, anyone with his experience
and all his years in the business...

101
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:45,824
should recognize a live one
when he sees one.

102
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,892
Well, yes, dear.
Uh, good-bye.

103
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:52,460
I'll see you later tonight.

104
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:56,038
[Door Creaks Open, Closes]

105
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:59,772
[Exhales]
Well, Marilyn, we could certainly use
a little extra money around here.

106
00:09:59,846 --> 00:10:03,145
For one thing,
Eddie needs a new cover
for his bed.

107
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:06,708
The old one is getting so warped,
he can hardly close it at bedtime.

108
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:09,277
Hey, Mom.! Mom.!

109
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:12,847
Pop went off to work
without his lunch box.
Oh, dear.

110
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:16,760
Well, thank you, Eddie.
Now go back to the kitchen
and finish your breakfast.

111
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:19,320
Would you like me
to drop it off
on my way to class?

112
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:22,232
No, Marilyn.
I'll just call the parlor,

113
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:25,965
leave a message for Herman
with Mr. Gateman.

114
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,372
Oh, uh, Uncle Herman
could eat in a restaurant today.

115
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:33,606
He says there's one around the corner
that usually empties out
whenever he gets there.

116
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:42,281
Hello.
Gateman, Goodbury and Graves?

117
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:46,348
This is Mrs. Herman Munster.
I'd like to leave a message
for my husband.

118
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:48,758
You see, he...

119
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:52,764
He what? When?

120
00:10:52,832 --> 00:10:55,995
Are you sure? Well...

121
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:59,732
I see. Well, thank you very much.

122
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:05,338
Aunt Lily, what happened?
All the color's rushed
into your face.

123
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:10,405
What happened? Herman's going
to work every morning
this week has been a fraud.

124
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:13,975
The big goofball
got fired last Monday.

125
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,484
What I want to know is
what's Herman been doing
this past week...

126
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,721
after he left the house
every morning?

127
00:11:22,795 --> 00:11:26,959
He's been out looking for work.
He's had five jobs in five days.

128
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:30,696
You can't ask for
a better record than that.
He's a perfect failure.

129
00:11:42,382 --> 00:11:44,543
I'm sure, Mr. Tom Fong, sir,

130
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:48,610
if you'd consider hiring me,
I'd live up to all your expectations.

131
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:51,179
I advertised "Boy Wanted."

132
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:54,920
You sure number one
big boy all right.

133
00:11:54,994 --> 00:11:58,828
Thank you.
Tell me, you ever work
in laundry before?

134
00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:02,390
No. I, uh, I never have.

135
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:05,631
I thought maybe
you got caught in mangle.

136
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:10,165
Hey, I betcha I know what happened,
you rascal. You have fight over girl,

137
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:14,077
and boyfriend make you
chop, chop, chop on the kisser.

138
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:18,811
I don't think so.
Uh, I mean, if anyone had gone
chop-chop on my kisser,

139
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:22,048
I think I'd be
the first to know.
[Laughs]

140
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:25,557
[Laughs]
You know, I think
you're gonna be all right.

141
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,616
You come over here.

142
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:31,094
I go show you something,
learn you business upside down.

143
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:35,999
I go take you in the back room
and show you modus operandi.

144
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:41,735
"Modus operandi?"
Yeah. I "clue you in,"
Charlie. Watch yourself.

145
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:47,277
Oh, boy.
Come here now.

146
00:12:47,346 --> 00:12:49,837
Now you see I got here
two machine.

147
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,578
That dryer,
that one over there a washer.

148
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:55,644
You take the dirty clothes,
you put in a washer.

149
00:12:55,721 --> 00:13:00,055
When bell ring,
you take wet clothes
and you put in the dryer.

150
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:03,118
[Rings]
When this bell rings,
you take out dryer,

151
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:07,360
put in clean hamper,
get more dirty clothes,
put in washer.

152
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:11,995
You do same thing all the time,
back and forth, back and forth,
every time the bell ring.

153
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,005
You dig?

154
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:19,909
Uh, when bell ring on dryer,
put dry clothes in hamper.
That good.

155
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:23,380
When bell ring on washer,
put wet clothes in dryer.
Uh-huh.

156
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:27,249
Uh, then put more dirty clothes
in washer.
Boy, you very good.

157
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,187
Now come here.
I show you more.

158
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:34,420
When you get all clothes,
you bring over here and you iron.

159
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:38,988
Now, when you iron,
no goof off. You concentrate.

160
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:41,226
Don't worry,
I'll use my head.

161
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,431
Oh, I don't know.
I think more better use iron.
More flatter.

162
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:50,340
You keep on do that
till whole mess clean up.

163
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:52,400
You got it, Charlie?
Got it.

164
00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:54,105
Now come here.

165
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,674
If you get in trouble...
any kind of trouble...
that emergency valve, you know?

166
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:02,744
And you turn emergency valve,
that shut off everything.

167
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:04,813
You got it, Charlie?
Gotcha.

168
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:09,260
Good. All right.
Oh, uh, excuse me,
Mr. Tom Fong, sir.

169
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:13,992
But aren't you
going to be here?
No, no. I go lunch now.

170
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:16,728
I go down the street
and get a enchilada.

171
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:21,296
Well, fine, but, uh,
what should I do
if a customer comes in?

172
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:24,542
Hide.

173
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:31,547
Grandpa? Grandpa?

174
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:34,279
What is it, Lily?
Where are you going?

175
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:38,483
Out. I'm just not gonna stand by
and see my poor Herman...

176
00:14:38,558 --> 00:14:42,153
buffeted and submerged
by the cruel waves of misfortune.

177
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:46,062
"Waves?" What happened?
Did the bum get a job as a lifeguard?

178
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:48,794
No. He doesn't have any job.

179
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:53,202
And as his wife,
I'm going to do something about it.

180
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:57,436
What can you do?
I can do what women
have done for centuries.

181
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:04,172
"Women have done for centuries?"

182
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,913
I get it. She's going to butt in
and ruin his life.

183
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:14,018
? This is the way
we wash our clothes?

184
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:16,425
? Wash our clothes
Wash our clothes?

185
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:20,761
? This is the way we wash our clothes
so early in the morning??

186

- [Ringing]

187
00:15:25,404 --> 00:15:30,398
Uh, when bell rings on dryer,
put dry clothes in hamper.

188
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:50,225
- [Rings]
- Bell. But, l...

189
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:54,562
Oh. Uh, when bell rings on washer,

190
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:56,966
put wet clothes in dryer.

191
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:26,655
Now, put more dirty clothes
in washer.

192
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:41,944
There. That was easy.

193
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:44,676
Herman, you got it made.

194
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:54,787
- [Rings]
- The bell?
Boy, that was quick.

[Frustrated Groan]

205
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:59,410
In other words, Mrs. Munster,

206
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:02,886
you're asking me to
reinstate your husband
in our employ?

207
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:05,788
Oh, yes, Mr. Gateman.
Think of it.

208
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:08,884
He's been here for 17 years.

209
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:13,591
Why, your parlor has become
his home away from home.

210
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:17,329
Really, uh, I'm afraid
my mind is made up.

211
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:19,769
But you can't take
all this away from him.

212
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,333
Herman's always been so happy
among the flowers and the wreaths.

213
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:29,575
Surrounded by the restful strains
of the organ music,
doing the thing he loves best.

214
00:19:29,648 --> 00:19:32,674
He was just saying to me
the other night,

215
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:37,916
"Lily," he said,
"that place really grabs me."

216
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:44,757
Well, that's quite a compliment.
But he demanded an increase in salary.

217
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,993
I'm afraid down here
we're not used to raising people.

218
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:57,999
? This is the way we quit the job
quit the job, quit the job?

219
00:19:59,478 --> 00:20:01,412
[Blows]

220
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,972
? This is the way we quit the job?

221
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:08,542
[Sighs]
? So early in the morning??

222
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,288
[Bubbling]

223
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:21,960
Oh, Mr. Gateman.
You must give Herman back his job.

224
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:26,037
He thinks of you...

225
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:30,508
not only as just an employer,
but as a father.

226
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:34,109
I never told anyone
this before, but,

227
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:37,342
well, at home,

228
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:41,580
he often refers to you as
"Da-Da Gateman."

229
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:45,249
Really, Mrs. Munster?
Oh, I tell you...

230
00:20:45,324 --> 00:20:48,418
I tell you, pussycat looks up to you...

231
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:52,954
the way Richard Chamberlain
looks up to Raymond Massey.

232
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:56,024
[Crying]
Mrs. Munster,

233
00:20:56,101 --> 00:21:00,265
that's the nicest thing
that anybody ever said to me.

234
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:03,331
I'll take him back
and give him his raise.

235
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:07,971
[Crying]
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

236
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:12,381
Please, go now.
I mustn't cry anymore.

237
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:17,445
There's a big affair
at the cemetery this afternoon...
I can't afford to show up dry.

238
00:21:19,258 --> 00:21:24,924
Oh, thank you,
you dear, sweet, kind man.

239
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:30,435
Um, we won't tell Herman
that I talked to you, will we?

240
00:21:30,502 --> 00:21:33,335
Oh, of course not,
Mrs. Munster.

241
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:38,741
It's no use, Grandpa.
I've lost six jobs
in the last five days.

242
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:43,646
I'm no good.
Even in the laundry business
I'm all washed up.

243
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:48,210
That's right, Herman.
Your next step
should be skid row.

244
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:53,281
But with PresidentJohnson
wiping out poverty, a bum like you
has got no place to go.

245
00:21:54,627 --> 00:21:57,619
I shouldn't have been so cocky
when I asked for that raise.

246
00:21:57,696 --> 00:22:00,130
Fate has dealt me
a deserving blow.

247
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:02,133
As has been said so many times,

248
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:06,661
"He who blows his own horn
only ends up with a fat lip."

249
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:08,570
After all, l...
[Ringing]

250
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:11,633
The bell! The bell!
I gotta get the clothes
out of the washer!

251
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,873
Will you take it easy?
It's only the telephone.

[Ringing Continues]

254
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:34,898
Hello. Oh, hello,
Mr. Gateman.

255
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:39,461
Uh, sir, about the other day,
I'm very sorry. I had no intention of...

256
00:22:43,142 --> 00:22:45,133
You want me to what?

257
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,303
Report for work in the morning?

258
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,642
You found you couldn't
get along without me?

259
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,884
Well, I'll tell you,
Gatey, old boy,

260
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:03,917
I've had a few other offers,
and I'd, uh, like time to consider
what's best for me in this situation.

261
00:23:03,996 --> 00:23:07,523
Oh, boy. One minute
he's Little Orphan Annie,

262
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:09,931
the next minute he's Charles de Gaulle.

263
00:23:12,271 --> 00:23:16,605
I can have my raise. Oh.

264
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:18,609
Well, I guess
under those circumstances,

265
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:21,840
I would be willing to resume
in your employ.

266
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:26,749
Mm-hmm. Thank you.
[Chuckles]
You're very kind.

267
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:39,661
[Laughing]
Oh, boy, Herman!

268
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:42,895
You got your job back
and the raise.

269
00:23:42,968 --> 00:23:45,459
What did you expect?

270
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:51,175
Oh, you're home, dear.

271
00:23:52,644 --> 00:23:55,909
Herman, I found out all about
your losing your job,

272
00:23:55,981 --> 00:23:59,644
and I want you to know that
we're behind you a hundred percent.

273
00:23:59,718 --> 00:24:03,119
Oh, yes, Uncle Herman.
We'll help you in any way we can.

274
00:24:03,188 --> 00:24:05,952
Now, now, now.
That's not necessary.

275
00:24:06,024 --> 00:24:09,926
It just so happens
Mr. Gateman has just called...

276
00:24:09,995 --> 00:24:12,657
and has begged me to come back.

277
00:24:12,731 --> 00:24:15,222
Herman, you don't mean
to tell me...

278
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,030
Of course, I insisted on the raise,

279
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:19,798
but I knew sooner
or later he'd come around.

280
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:24,036
Oh, Herman.
You're so forceful,

281
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:28,443
and you're such a marvelous husband
and father to your little brood.

282
00:24:28,514 --> 00:24:31,506
You know, Herman,
we look up to you to guide us...

283
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:35,246
and protect us against
the trials and tribulations of life.

284
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,814
You have made... right here at home...
our own ponderosa.

285
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:41,951
Aw, shucks, girl.

286
00:24:42,027 --> 00:24:46,987
Uh, on top of that,
I ain't never said
a discouraging word.
