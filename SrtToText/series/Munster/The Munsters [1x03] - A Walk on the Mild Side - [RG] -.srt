[Groaning]

2
00:00:12,926 --> 00:00:16,862
- [Grunts]
- Oh, there you are, Herman.

3
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:21,091
- Why haven't you come to bed?
- I'm just going over these bills.

4
00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:26,369
Oh, you've been reading
in the dark again.

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,807
It'll ruin your eyes. And then we'll
have to get you another pair.

6
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:32,436
Lily, just look at this.

7
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:36,004
$103 for electricity!
[Circuits Humming]

8
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:39,715
[Rattling]

9
00:00:40,887 --> 00:00:44,323
Well, you know. Grandpa
needs a lot of electricity...
[Banging]

10
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:46,621
To carry on his experiments
in the dungeon.

11
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:49,491
Why can't he have
his dungeon in the attic,
where there's plenty of light?

12
00:00:50,897 --> 00:00:55,994
And that's not all. There's taxes,
food, braces for Eddie's fangs...

13
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:58,060
I tell ya. I just can't sleep!

14
00:00:58,138 --> 00:01:02,404
You poor dear.
You do look dead on your feet.

15
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:06,606
Why don't you take a nice,
long walk in the night air?

16
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,841
It may help
to clear your mind.

17
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,512
Okay, Lily.
I'll give it a try.

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,954
I think I'll talk a walk over
to Midcity Park.

19
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:18,013
It's quiet over there.

20
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:22,790
Chief Harris, we're still
getting complaints about that
mysterious purse-snatcher...

21
00:01:22,863 --> 00:01:24,797
who's been seen
around Midcity Park.

22
00:01:24,865 --> 00:01:27,766
All right, Sergeant. Have them put
a couple more squad cars in the area.

23
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:31,793
Yes, sir.
And tell them to pick up anybody
who even looks suspicious.

24
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:33,863
Okay, Chief.

25
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:46,378
[Muttering]

26
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:49,176
Good evening.

27
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:18,968
[Screaming]
Oh!

28
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:36,721
[Screams]

29
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:47,000
Police! Police! I want
to report a monster!

30
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:57,374
Here's your breakfast, Eddie.
Thanks, Mom.

31
00:03:58,418 --> 00:04:00,386
Good morning, dear.
Good morning, dear.

32
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:02,921
[Kissing Noises]
Good morning, Marilyn.

33
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:05,116
Morning, Eddie!
Morning, Pop.!

34
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:09,191
Good morning, everybody!
Good morning, Grandpa.

35
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:12,288
[Lily, Marilyn]
Good morning, Grandpa.
[Eddie Knocking Back]

36
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:15,528
[Lily] How do you
want your eggs, Grandpa?
Gloomy-side up, please!

37
00:04:15,602 --> 00:04:17,536
Well, I'm off.

38
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:20,232
Good-bye, everybody.
Bye!
Good-bye, dear.

39
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:26,675
Oh, the Angels won again!

40
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:29,306
There's a frightening headline.

41
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:32,180
"Creature Terrorizes
Midcity Park."

42
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:37,690
"Last night, the police department
received several reports...

43
00:04:37,757 --> 00:04:39,987
"of what was described
by eyewitnesses...

44
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,756
"as a fiendish monster
roaming in Midcity Park...

45
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:45,127
at approximately 12:30 a.m."

46
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:47,962
Isn't that ridiculous?

47
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:51,367
It just so happens that
I was in the park last night,
at that time!

48
00:04:51,438 --> 00:04:53,906
And I didn't see any fiends
or monsters.

49
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:59,469
Well, I'd just as soon you
wouldn't go walking in the park
at night for a while.

50
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:02,106
Ketchup, please.

51
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:06,016
Gee, Dad. Can I go with you to see
the fiendish monster next time?

52
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:08,020
Oh, for goodness' sakes, Eddie.

53
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:11,649
What's all this talk about
fiends and monsters?
There's no such thing.

54
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:13,750
Sit down and eat
your breakfast.

55
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:17,353
Just to be on the safe side,
I think we all...

56
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,830
ought to stay close to the house
for the time being.

57
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:24,393
Lily, none of this talk is gonna
stop me from taking my nightly walk.

58
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:26,530
I slept like a baby last night.

59
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:29,336
Walking seems to be the only thing
that cures my insomnia.

60
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:32,071
Don't make such a big deal out of it.

61
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:36,172
Lots of people have insomnia, and you
don't find them losing any sleep over it.

62
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:39,242
What's troubling you, anyway?

63
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:42,618
Well, Grandpa, we've been having
some financial worries lately.

64
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:48,150
[Chuckles] Well it just so happens
that right now I am working
on a fabulous invention...

65
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:51,163
that will make this family
some big money.

66
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,894
- What kind of invention?
- I'm not talking.

67
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:57,801
Why, that's the way Edison got
the electric light away from me.

68
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:03,265
[Chattering]

69
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:06,972
Quiet!
Now, everybody, calm down!

70
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:09,777
Just calm down.

71
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:14,286
- Now. What did he look like?
- Well, he was about nine feet tall.

72
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:17,289
And he was all green!
[Gasping]

73
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:20,155
I know that guy.!
He's theJolly Green Giant.!

74
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:23,320
It was only a matter of time
till he ran amok.

75
00:06:23,396 --> 00:06:26,365
And his hands were ice cold.
Yeah, I told ya.

76
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:28,958
It's that frozen food
he handles.

77
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:31,799
He had no hair,
and his eyes were bright red.

78
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:36,740
[Drunk] Oh, that's not true.!
Only the white parts were red.

79
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,974
[Moaning]
All right, now.
Everybody please calm down!

80
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:44,141
Calm down here!
Now, it'll all be
taken care of.

81
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:47,277
I can assure you, the department
will do all it can...

82
00:06:47,353 --> 00:06:49,844
to apprehend
this so-called "monster."

83
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:53,859
- I'll drink to that!
- The reporters would like
to ask a few questions, Chief.

84
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:57,419
No. I'm sorry. Now now, gentlemen.
When we have a statement ready,
we'll let you know.

85
00:06:57,497 --> 00:07:00,796
Thank you very much.
Thank you. That'll be fine, folks.
[Groaning]

86
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:02,801
Thank you all very much.

87
00:07:05,405 --> 00:07:10,308
[Sighs] Why do things like this
have to happen just when there's
a shake-up in the department?

88
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:15,441
When the commissioner arrives,
I'll be in my office.
Okay, Chief.

89
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:26,988
Chief Harris here.
Give me the radio room.

90
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:30,988
Mulligan? Chief Harris.

91
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:33,897
I want an around-the-clock
stakeout in Midcity Park.

92
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:36,458
Tell them to be on the lookout
for a greenish man,

93
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:38,766
about nine or 10 feet tall,

94
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:41,568
with bright red eyes
and cold hands.

95
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:48,777
Mulligan, it's remarks like that...

96
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:51,316
that have kept you from making sergeant!

97
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:58,217
[Eddie] What is it, Grandpa?
[Marilyn]
What's it supposed to do?

98
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,818
[Grandpa, Laughing]
It's an enlarging machine.

99
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:03,829
It can make anything bigger.

100
00:08:03,897 --> 00:08:07,060
Why, with this machine, I can make
an ordinary banana big enough...

101
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:09,567
to feed a family of monkeys
for a whole year!

102
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:14,005
[Chortling]
Anything small, I can make big.

103
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:17,804
Ooh, why with this machine,
I could make Rhode Island...

104
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:20,903
the size ofTexas!

105
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,108
We'll make millions!
Then I'll make them bigger.

106
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:27,484
I could even make
the world's biggest Mickey Rooney.!

107
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:29,715
Here. Let me show you.

108
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:34,055
[Electrical Humming]

109
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:37,154
?? [Distorted Electronic Music]

110
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,358
Herman, honey? Lower.

111
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,901
?? [Continues]

112
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:44,903
[Explosion]

113
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:48,964
What was that?
Oh, that's just Grandpa, working on
his invention down in the lab.

114
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:51,602
[Electrical Humming]
Oh.

115
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,146
[Loud Explosion]

116
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:08,424
I don't understand it!
Hmm, why you...

117
00:09:08,494 --> 00:09:10,485
Ooh, allow me.

118
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:18,901
I think I know what's wrong.
I'm not using enough electricity!

119
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:29,607
There we are, Edgar. Got a nice,
fresh box of goodies for you.

120
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:33,277
There you go.
Put him in the ca...

121
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:36,516
C-Ca...
Okay.

122
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:38,716
Wait.

123
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,385
So help me, Commissioner Ludlow,
that's what he said:

124
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:43,520
Nine feet tall and green!

125
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:46,827
Oh, ridiculous, Sergeant.
You must have misunderstood him.

126
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:54,838
Oh, hello there, Commissioner.
Just giving Edgar his din-din.

127
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:58,635
Harris...

128
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:02,476
Do you mind taking that bird
off of your head long enough...

129
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:05,881
to tell me what all this talk is
about monsters?

130
00:10:08,354 --> 00:10:10,481
[Scraping]

131
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:14,287
Herman? Aren't you ever
coming to bed?

132
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,658
What's the use?

133
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:19,789
I just don't seem to be able
to get any sleep anymore.

134
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:23,358
Have you tried counting wolves?
I've tried everything!

135
00:10:23,436 --> 00:10:27,736
The only thing that seems to help
is taking a walk in the park.

136
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:29,934
Herman, I don't want you
to go to the park.

137
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:32,773
Not with that fiend, or monster,
running around loose.

138
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:35,177
Lily. Honestly,
you're worse than Eddie.

139
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:39,014
In this day and age,
no enlightened person believes
in fiends and monsters.

140
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:42,248
Nevertheless, I don't want you
to go walking around in the park.

141
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:44,415
Not until they catch whatever it is.

142
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,425
Lily. I'm a full-grown man.

143
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:50,985
I refuse to be caught up
in this... hysteria.

144
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:54,795
If a man can't feel safe
in the streets of his own town,
what's this country coming to?

145
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:56,801
[Humming, Exploding]

146
00:10:56,869 --> 00:11:00,566
What's that?
That's just Grandpa again,
working on his invention.

147
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,507
That settles it. I'll never
get any sleep around here.

148
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:06,374
Lily, I'm going out.

149
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,471
Good night, dear.

150
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,982
[Cackling]

151
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:20,822
Terrific, terrific, Eddie.
We'll make millions!

152
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:24,158
Now. Now. Just keep your eye
on this pencil.

153
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:34,168
Watch this.

[Sparking]

155
00:11:37,744 --> 00:11:40,212
Grandpa, that's great!

156
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,839
You turned that into
the biggest pencil I ever saw!

157

[Chuckles]

158
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:47,408
Can you make me bigger too?
I want to be as big as Daddy.

159
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:49,421
Of course!

160
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:52,253
Now, just stand right here.

161
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:54,316
Don't move! Hold still!

162
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:01,223
[Sparking]

163
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:05,861
Look what you did! What happened?

164
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:09,396
L-I must have put it in reverse.
It's all right. I'll fix it.

165
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:12,035
Hold still!

Here he comes! Get him.

169
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:48,144
Now, where the heck
is that fuse box?

170
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,745
Ah, here it is. Oh.

171
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:56,244
Now!
[Crashing]

172

[Electrical Sparking]

173
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:03,361
Maybe I'm not using
enough current!

174
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:07,891
Yeah!
[Sparking Continues]

175
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,958
There.

176
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:29,778
Herman!

177
00:13:30,923 --> 00:13:32,982
What's the matter?
Don't be frightened.

178
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:35,926
I'll protect you.
What are you talking about?

179
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:37,929
Th-The thing.
The horrible thing.

180
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:40,295
You were right, Lily.
It grabbed me in the park.

181
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:43,927
It was awful.
It had two heads
and four long blue arms.

182
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:47,332
I warned you not to
go out there, Herman.

183
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:50,170
You won't have to warn me again.
Don't worry. I'm not stepping foot
out of this house...

184
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:52,677
until they catch that thing!
Oh, shush.
Hush, dear. Hush, dear.

185
00:13:52,745 --> 00:13:55,009
There's no sense alarming
the rest of the family.

186
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:57,106
[Panting]
We just won't mention
this to them.

187
00:13:57,183 --> 00:14:00,209
Now, let's go on upstairs
and try to get some sleep.

188
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:02,754
Sleep? I'll never sleep again.

189
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:04,756
Oh, at least try.

190
00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:07,292
Okay. I'll try.

191
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,126
But Lily, is it all right
if we leave the lights on?

192
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:14,064
I tell ya, Chief, like they said,

193
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:16,658
nine feet tall
and all green!

194
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:18,897
We're lucky to have escaped
with our lives!

195
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:22,737
The taxpayers aren't
paying you to escape.
You're supposed to capture him.

196
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:25,106
Like they do in the movies, you know?

197
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:28,545
Now, both of you, get back
to your posts in that park.

198
00:14:28,614 --> 00:14:31,606
[Panting]
But, Chief, it's still dark out!

199
00:14:31,684 --> 00:14:34,175
You wouldn't want to
walk us over there, would you?

200
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:37,122
Get outta here!

201
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:54,633
Just what in the name of
Pat O'Brien do you think you're doin'?

202
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:57,335
I'm holding up the ceiling, Commissioner.
May I suggest...

203
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,878
that your time would be
more profitably spent...

204
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:03,780
by trying to catch that monster
who has been terrorizing our parks?

205
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:06,215
Now, this is the last time
I intend to be awakened...

206
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:10,051
in the middle of the night
by citizens' committees, demanding
to know what's being done.

207
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:13,990
Yeah, but, Commissioner...
Unless you take immediate action
to apprehend this fiend,

208
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,463
you will be back pounding a beat
in the most desolate, deserted,

209
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:21,523
law-forsaken section of town
that I can find!

210
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:23,535
You got that, Harris?

211
00:15:23,603 --> 00:15:26,731
Yes, sir. I'll get him tonight,
Commissioner.

212
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:29,832
That's my promise, or you
can have my badge, sir.

All right, all right.
It's a great moment for us.

218

All of a sudden,
I've got a partner. Now.

How did this happen?

00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,440
More current!

223
00:16:51,457 --> 00:16:55,086
Men, it must have occurred
to you by now...

224
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:58,460
that we've had absolutely
no success whatsoever in
apprehending the monster...

225
00:16:58,531 --> 00:17:01,625
that has been terrorizing
Midcity Park.

226
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,692
It's obvious that, in this case,

227
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:09,173
ingenuity, imagination,
intelligence... do not work.

228
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:12,404
Therefore, I have decided
to handle this matter myself.

229
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:14,469
That's all, men. Dismissed.

230
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:17,574
Is that the box, Sergeant?
Yes, sir. That's it.

231
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,584
What's in it?

232
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:24,589
That box contains
a secret formula that will manacle
the midnight marauder of Midcity Park!

Lily, when is Grandpa gonna be
finished working in his laboratory?

236
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:43,767
The sound of that machinery
is making me nervous.

237
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:47,745
Now, you're just on edge because you
haven't been getting much sleep lately.

238
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:51,476
He should be turning it off soon.
It's getting pretty late.
By the way, what time is it?

239
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,917

At the tone, it'll be later
than you think. Nevermore.

I had no idea it was that late.
Where's Marilyn?

she finally got a date tonight.

Oh! Well, isn't that nice?
Where did she go?

244
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:13,004
Oh, they went to a movie, and then
they're going for a walk in the park.

245
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:15,597
In the park?
In the park?

246
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:20,338
Eddie. How could you let
Marilyn go to the park with
that monster running around?

247
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:22,938
But you said there was
no such thing as monsters.

248
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:25,415
Oh, Herman.
What are we going to do?

249
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:29,284
Well, I guess someone will have
to go to the park and protect her.

250
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:31,823
I'll get my coat!
No!

251
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:36,055
Lily, I'll go alone.
Oh, y-you can't go
out there alone!

252
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:38,096
Why don't you
take Spot with you?

253
00:18:38,164 --> 00:18:41,463
- Ha! Spot's afraid of his own shadow.

I don't blame him.

00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:48,740
Chief Harris will be
right out, Commissioner.

00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:50,742
Oh, what's takin' him
so long in there?

257
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,973
He didn't confide in me, sir.
He said he was workin'
on a secret weapon.

258
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:56,879

I guess he's ready.
You can go in now, sir.

Oh, hello, Commissioner.
Come in.

260

It's me.

like my mother wanted me to?

Yes, dear?

causing you all so much worry.

As I told you last night,
I wasn't hurt at all.

[Marilyn] Fact is,
we came right home after the movie.
We never went near the park at all.

00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:49,078
I'm glad you didn't.
It was terrible!

I've never had a more
hair-raising experience.

was raised, you should have seen
the hair on the baldheaded lady.

Herman, I've told you
a hundred million times, don't exaggerate.!

I'm not exaggerating.
It really happened.

apprehended the so-called monster...

"that has been terrorizing

"The monster was a known
purse-snatcher who disguised
his features...

by wearing a woman's stocking
over his head."
See?

00:22:40,906 --> 00:22:44,034
I told you there was
no such thing as monsters.

"Credit for his capture goes to
Police Chief Harris,

"who used himself as bait by
disguising himself as a woman.

00:23:11,503 --> 00:23:13,971
But remember this, Eddie.

302
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:17,065
It's the duty of every citizen
to protect the police.

303
00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:22,045
According to the newspaper, Chief Harris
is getting a medal from the police
commissioner at this very moment!

304
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,218
Harris, I must admit
that in the past,

305
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:31,916
I've been a little leery about
your, uh... well, to say the least,
eccentric behavior.

306
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,857
But, I must say, you do
seem to get things done.

307
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:37,327
Well, thank you, sir.
Tell me, Harris.

308
00:23:37,396 --> 00:23:41,298
Do you have any idea
who the citizen was
who came to your assistance?

309
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:44,164
Well, I don't know his name, sir,
but I think I could describe him.

310
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:46,170
Oh? What'd he look like?

311
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:51,767
Well, he was about nine
or 10 feet tall, with green skin,
uh, red eyes and long arms.

312
00:23:54,146 --> 00:23:56,910
Fine. Right. Very good.

313
00:23:56,982 --> 00:23:58,973
[Hangs Up Receiver]

314
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:13,292
I don't know.
L-I apologize.

315
00:24:13,365 --> 00:24:18,064
I'm sorry. I thought my machine
would make a fortune for this family.

316
00:24:18,137 --> 00:24:21,698
But somehow, I just can't seem
to generate enough electricity.

317
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,972
That's all right, Grandpa.
Don't worry about it.

318
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:26,977
We all love you anyway,
Grandpa.

319
00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:29,570
Ah, but one good thing though.
[Laughs]

320
00:24:29,648 --> 00:24:32,708
It did help cure Herman
of his insomnia.

321
00:24:32,785 --> 00:24:36,186
How did you do it?
Ohh!

322
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:40,749
With one of these giant sleeping pills
I made with my machine!

323
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:46,286
How could he swallow that?
Oh, he didn't swallow that.

324
00:24:46,365 --> 00:24:48,595
I accidentally dropped it
on his head.
