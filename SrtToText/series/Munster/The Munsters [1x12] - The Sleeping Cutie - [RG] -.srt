It's a terrible thing to do.

00:00:07,821 --> 00:00:09,755
It's downright murder!

Herman, I know
it could be a disaster,

5
00:00:13,193 --> 00:00:16,651
but I think we ought to let Grandpa
go through with his experiment.

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,190
Herman, I just wanna
fill your gas tank with water.

7
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:24,795
But it's crazy trying to turn
water into gasoline with a pill.

Uh, uh...
You'll ruin my beautiful car.

Herman, why don't we humor him?

Last time we did,
he invented athlete's foot.

we'll all be millionaires.

Well, we could certainly
use some money.

I'd like to carpet the dungeon
in wall-to-wall moss...

and get some new lightning rods
for the house.

I think you're being
very selfish.

38
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:29,082
You should stop thinking of yourself
and share your invention with mankind.

39
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:31,783
I am gonna share it, 50-50.

40

I get the money.

Well, I wish I felt
as well as I look.

00:03:46,673 --> 00:03:49,471
I just haven't been able to sleep
for the last two nights.

Have you tried hanging from the rafters
with your head down like I do?

47

I'd like to, Grandpa,

48
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:58,147
but I just don't seem
to have the toes for it.

49

Well, I'll go down to the lab later,
and I'll mix you up something.

According to the old gentleman's letter,

to turn water into gasoline.

into this pan of water.

Now you just
sit right down here,

and I'll put you to sleep
with my hypnotism.

I'm very good at that,
you know.

83
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:04,270
Now you just concentrate
on my watch, all right?

84
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:06,710
Now look at the watch
and concentrate.

look your grandpa in the eye.

counts to three,

88
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:21,386

Now, let me see.
Where are the recipes?

94
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:49,186
Grandpa, it's a telegram
from the oil company.

95
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:51,985
They're sending a man tomorrow
to discuss your invention with you.

Tomorrow. That's fine.

97
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,687
I'll have a batch
of my "instant gasoline" pills
ready by then.

But what about my insomnia?
Don't worry, Marilyn.

So he blows up the house
once in a while.

He just wants to feel needed.

Besides, he has to get
those gasoline pills made,

a sleeping potion for Marilyn.

to be neater.

I keep telling him
over and over again...

153

not to leave these empty
pet food cans around
after he's fed Spot.

[Can Clatters]

156
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:32,076
Grandpa, how's
the gasoline pill going?

157
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:34,739
The man
from the oil company's
coming today.

158
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:38,443
I got a little sidetracked
making a sleeping potion
for Marilyn,

159
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:41,078
but I'll have those pills
ready in time.

160
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:44,646
[Herman]
You know, Grandpa, your invention
may revolutionize motoring.

161
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:50,424
Instead of gasoline, we may all
need credit cards to buy water.
[Laughing]

162
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:52,657
Mom! Dad!
Marilyn won't wake up.

163
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:55,667
What?
I shook her,
but she just lies there.

164
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:57,760
Oh, dear!

165
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:00,839
[Grandpa]
Hurry.

166
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:07,971
[Clapping]

167
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:11,346
Well, Grandpa, just don't stand there.
Do something.

168
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,908
That's it, all right.
What do you mean?

169
00:11:13,987 --> 00:11:16,148
Well, I... got a little confused.

170
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:20,022
I must have given her
the Sleeping Beauty potion
by mistake.

171
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:22,220
Oh! That means
she'll sleep forever.

172
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:25,287
No, no.
The spell can be broken.

173
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:30,998
To wake this sleeping beauty,
you must remember this.

174
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:36,702
To break the spell of slumber,
a prince her lips must kiss.
[Kisses]

175
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:40,712
[Pounding]
Oh, my. That's the front door.

176
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,839
Grandpa, you'd better do something fast.

177
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:50,485
But, Grandpa,
wh-wh-where are we ever gonna get
a handsome prince to kiss Marilyn?

178
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:53,320
Oh, where are we gonna get
a handsome prince, period?

179

[Door Creaking]
[Wind Blowing]

180
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:02,060
Mrs. Munster?

181
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:04,433
Yes?

182
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:07,268
I'm, uh...
I'm the Reliable Oil Company.

183
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,331
L-I mean I'm from
the Reliable Oil Company,

184
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:12,572
and-and I have some business
I'd like to discuss with your father.

185
00:12:12,645 --> 00:12:15,307
Oh, I'm sorry,
but he's terribly busy right now.

186
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:19,977
Could you come back later?
You see, it's a family problem,
a domestic crisis.

187
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:22,214
Oh, couldn't I just
speak to him for a minute?

188
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:25,257
[Sighs]
I'm terribly sorry,
but it's out of the question right now.

189
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:27,417
You come back later, all right?

190
00:12:27,493 --> 00:12:30,860
I have to get back to the dungeon.
Yes, of course.

191
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:37,193
"The dungeon"?

192
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:42,407
[Tsks]

193
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:44,409
If you'd just keep
your files straight, Grandpa,

194
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:46,411
this never
would have happened.

195
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:49,539
You're right, Herman.
I've done a terrible thing
to Marilyn.

196
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:52,982
You shouldn't have kept
that stupid Sleeping Beauty
formula around in the first place.

197
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:56,112
It's too dangerous.
I'll get rid of it right now.

198
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:58,248
Good.
Where is it?

199
00:12:58,324 --> 00:13:00,622
Oh. Ha ha.
There it is.

200
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:03,958
Oh. I'll take care of this
right now.

201
00:13:04,964 --> 00:13:06,955
[Chuckles]
Good riddance.

202
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:16,400
Then what's this?
Oh, this?

203
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:21,445
Oh, no!
This is the Sleeping Beauty formula.

204
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:29,311
Then, uh, then what...
I burned the formula
for instant gasoline.

205
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:36,084
Grandpa, you are the world's
oldest goofball.

206
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:43,661
Domestic crisis?
Why, Dick, boy, they're just stalling.

207
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:46,705
What kind of domestic crisis?
I don't know exactly, sir.

208
00:13:46,772 --> 00:13:50,367
It's kind of strange over there...
that-that house and everything.

209
00:13:50,443 --> 00:13:53,412
Well, all these geniuses
are a little odd.

210
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:56,312
Why would they want
to stall me off?

211
00:13:56,382 --> 00:13:59,715
They probably want to get some offers
from some of the other oil companies.

212
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:02,049
And play one bid
off against the other.
Exactly.

213
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:04,248
And that means
we've got to act fast.

214
00:14:04,323 --> 00:14:07,019
Dick, I want you to get back there,
get that slippery old fox signed up.

215
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:10,119
I don't care what you go through.
Just sign him up.

216
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:12,664
Yes, sir.
Dick.

217
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:15,826
If you come back
with that contract,

218
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:18,097
it means a vice presidency.

219
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:20,105
A vice presidency?
Yes, sir.

220
00:14:20,173 --> 00:14:23,108
And remember, Dick,
the honor and integrity...

221
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:26,009
of the Reliable Oil Company
is at stake.

222
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,172
So get that contract
by hook or crook!

223
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:31,182
Yes, sir.

224

[Croaking]
Nah! Duds, every one of'em.

Hmm!

the way they used to in Transylvania.

You and your old-world methods. Hah!

Lily and I are going about it
the modern, sensible way.

231
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:05,275
Oh. And, uh, what is
the "modern, sensible way"
to find the prince?

232
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:07,649
Look in the Yellow Pages?

233
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,917
No. We put an ad
in the newspaper.
Oh.

00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:27,165
You won't even get frogs
with that.

240
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,231
[Lily]
I'm afraid you're wrong, Grandpa.

241
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:34,841
Eddie says there are already
two applicants upstairs
who answered the ad.

242
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:37,246
I'm going to interview them.
Oh, and, Herman,

243
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:40,774
when we're ready for the kissing,
I'll call you to bring Marilyn up.

244
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:50,118
Hah!

245
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:54,165
What are they putting on here?

246
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:57,600
Uh, I don't know.

247
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:01,436
My agent sent me over.
Said they advertised
for a prince.

248
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:03,998
Goodness, Newmar,
these off-Broadway theaters...

249
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:07,045
get creepier and further out
all the time.

250
00:16:07,113 --> 00:16:11,914
- Gentlemen.
- Well, whatever they're doing,
they're already in rehearsal.

251
00:16:11,984 --> 00:16:14,350
It's so nice of you to come.

252
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:20,082
Uh, I understand
you're lookin' for a prince.

253
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,287
Yes. Uh, just exactly
what is it we're to do?

254
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:25,922
Are you familiar with the story
of Sleeping Beauty?

255
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:28,990
Sleeping Beau...
Oh, yes. A delightful fable.

256
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:32,560
Oh, I was in the Beckett
adaptation at Royal Beach.

257
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:35,900
It's nice to be versatile.

258
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:39,911
But the prince I'm looking for
will have to give an authentic kiss.

259
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:43,642
Uh, what's the motivation?
What's the salary?

260
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:46,207
You gonna have tryouts?

261
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:48,378
Tryouts?
Yeah.

262
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:52,618
You know, test the both of us
and decide which of us is best.

263
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:54,956
Oh, that's a splendid idea.

264
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:02,098
Herman? We're ready.

265
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:06,195
Man, this is certainly
a fascinating theater you got here.

266
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:09,366
This isn't a theater.
This is our home.

267
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:11,376
Your home?

They're the rudest pair
I've ever seen.
[Object Clattering]

270
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:33,698
Lily, I'll bet you forgot to warn them
about Marilyn's looks.

271
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:35,825
Oh, I did forget.

272
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:39,701
Oh, dear. I love her so much...
I keep forgetting
about her handicap.

Poor dear. Hmm.

Well, thank goodness she has us
to stand between her and the world.

Bad boy.

278
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:18,265
Oh, it's you.
He must have thought
you were the new milkman.

279
00:18:18,344 --> 00:18:20,369
Doesn't he like milkmen?

280
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:24,678
Oh, he loved the last one.
He kept burying him
in the backyard.

281
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,514
Very playful.
Oh, yes.

[Stammering]
Mrs. Munster, I have
some pressing business...

283
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:33,822
which I simply must discuss "father"
with your "further."

284
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:36,293
I mean, further
with your-your father.

285
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:39,092
Perhaps you remember me.
Yes, and I'm awfully sorry,

286
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:41,360
but Father is still too busy
to see you.

287
00:18:41,434 --> 00:18:44,767
But, Mrs. Munster, l-I am
with the Reliable Oil Company,

288
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:48,773
and I can match or better any deal
you may have been offered
by the competition.

289
00:18:49,842 --> 00:18:54,040
I am sure you're what you say, but I'm sorry.
He just hasn't got the time to see you.

290
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:58,379
Today is one of those days
when just everything seems to go wrong.

291
00:18:58,451 --> 00:19:02,012
If you'd only give me a chance.
I just keep telling you, young man...

292
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:09,554
Is this...
Is this S-S-Spot?

293
00:19:09,628 --> 00:19:11,823
Good heavens, no.
Spot's an animal.

294
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:14,229
This is my husband.
Uh, how do you do?

295
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,894
Hello.
Herman, why did you
invite him in?

296
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:19,836
I just explained to the young man
that Father can't see him.

297
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:22,533
Now, Lily, of course
he can see Mr. Prince.

Oh, at last our prince has come.

royal blood in your veins?

00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:45,296
Oh, yes. L... Thank you.

305
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:48,265
I understand that's how
we got the family name.

306
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:50,325
Of course, it was a long time ago.

307
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:53,235
Well, as they say,
old blood is always the best.

308
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:56,502
[Chokes]
Yes, uh...

309
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:58,736
Oh, thank you.

310
00:19:58,811 --> 00:20:00,802
You know...
No. No, thanks.

311
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,976
You're all being so nice to me,
l-I can't help thinking
there's a catch to it.

312
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:09,214
It's almost as though I were...
as though I were being
fattened up for something.

313
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:12,621
Is-Isn't that silly?
[Snickering]

314
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:15,851
[Both Laughing]

315
00:20:15,928 --> 00:20:17,862
Oh, what a sense of humor.

316
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:22,333
Well, Dick, my boy,
I'm ready to do business
with your company.

317
00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:24,392
Uh, but, uh, Grandpa,

318
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,906
didn't you b-u-r-n
the you know what?

319
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:32,000
Herman, please.
Let me handle this.

320
00:20:32,077 --> 00:20:34,545
I have the forms right here, sir.
Eh, not so fast.

321
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:37,309
There's just one little thing.
Oh, if it's a matter of money...

322
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:39,442
No, no, no, no.
It's not a matter of money.

323
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:41,543
You see, it's-it's a matter
of tradition.

324
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,351
Now, you see,
we're from the Old Country,
and we have a family custom...

325
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:47,688
that, before we discuss
a business deal,

326
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,422
the party of the second part...
that's you...
[Chuckles]

327
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:52,760
Must kiss the youngest member
of the family.

328
00:20:52,831 --> 00:20:54,765
Oh.

329
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:58,836
You mean I have to... kiss him?

330
00:20:58,904 --> 00:21:03,238
What we mean is the youngest
female member of the family.

331
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:06,437
Oh.
She's down in the dungeon.

332
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:08,503
The... dungeon.

333
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:14,711
Tell me, which, uh...
Which side of the family
does she... resemble?

334
00:21:14,787 --> 00:21:16,721
No. No, no, no.
Don't tell me.

335
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:21,192
Mr. Prince,
I have to be frank with you.

336
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,458
Poor Marilyn is...
well, to put it bluntly...

337
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:28,022
less attractive
than the rest of the family.

338
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,695
You might say
she's the ugly duckling.

339
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:35,206
And-And you want me
to kiss her?

340
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:37,299
Well, you can close your eyes.

341
00:21:37,376 --> 00:21:39,310
Come on.
And then we talk business.

342
00:21:39,378 --> 00:21:41,369
Then we talk business.

343
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:54,718
[Trapdoor Creaking]

344
00:21:56,695 --> 00:22:00,631
- [Squeaking]
- Igor, now mind your manners.

345
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:03,668
I told you,
no snacks between meals.

346
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:06,330
Uh, Mr. Prince,

347
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:08,498
I'd like you to meet my niece.

348
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:20,850
This is the ugly duckling?

349
00:22:30,629 --> 00:22:34,622
Wonderful.! Now we can go up
and discuss the deal.

350
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:38,200
What... What deal is that?

351
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:45,600
[Herman Murmuring]

352
00:22:45,678 --> 00:22:49,614
Uh... Uh, Mr. -Mr. Prince?

353
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:52,446
Uh...

354
00:22:52,518 --> 00:22:54,486
[Stammering]
Mr. Prince?

355
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:57,249
Uh, Mr. Prince.

356
00:23:01,093 --> 00:23:03,755
Now, sir, about our deal.

357
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:06,992
Grandpa, tell him.

358
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:09,091
Well, uh...
[Clears Throat]

359
00:23:09,168 --> 00:23:12,729
Dick, my boy,
there's a little something
that you ought to know.

360
00:23:12,805 --> 00:23:16,241
The Reliable Oil Company
is prepared to pay the sum
of $50,000 to you...

361
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:18,299
to keep your product
off the market.

362
00:23:18,377 --> 00:23:23,440
You see, it's like this...
Did you say keep it off the market?

363
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:27,315
Yes, of course.
We certainly have no intention
of giving up the gasoline business.

364
00:23:27,386 --> 00:23:29,377
All you have to do
is keep your formula
off the market.

365
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:33,915
Oh, I think that can be arranged.
What was that last sum
that you just mentioned?

366
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:36,085
$50,000.
Grandpa.
Yes? What?

367
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:39,961
Uh, he'll sign the contracts,
but we can't take the money.

368
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,024
Can't take the money?
No, of course not.

369
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:46,401
Not after what he's done
for our poor unfortunate little girl.

370
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:49,771
Besides, the big dummy
burnt the formula.

371
00:23:51,777 --> 00:23:53,768
Allow me.

372
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:57,848
Bats!

373
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:02,182
Well, that's... That's more
than generous of you, sir.
L-I must say.

374
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:10,990
And now if the, uh,
"poor unfortunate little girl"
has no objections,

375
00:24:11,063 --> 00:24:13,998
I'd like to take her out
to celebrate.

376
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:16,762
Well, I can't make the excuse
of being too sleepy.

377
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:18,769
I'd love to.

378
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:21,305
Good night, Mrs. Munster, Mr. Munster.
Good night, sir.

379
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:27,876
Say, kids, uh, uh...
You can have the car,
but, uh, remember.

380
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:31,313
Have it back before 12:00,
or it'll turn into a pumpkin.

381
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:33,817
Thank you, sir.

382
00:24:33,886 --> 00:24:37,515
[Sighs]
Oh, Herman.

383
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:41,320
You're so sweet and thoughtful.
[Door Closes]

384
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:44,260
When they made you,
they broke the mold.

385
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:47,522
That doctor
always was a butterfingers.

386
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,295
[Laughing]
