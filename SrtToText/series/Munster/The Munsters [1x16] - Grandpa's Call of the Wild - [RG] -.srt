00:00:09,723 --> 00:00:11,657
Oh, Herman, it's you.

3
00:00:11,725 --> 00:00:15,354
Yes, dear. I, uh...
I forgot my key.

4
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:19,456
I didn't want to
break the door down again.
It always makes such a mess.

5
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:21,467
How were things
at the parlor, dear?

6
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:25,369
Business has been
kind of dead all week.
That's nice. Oh, Herman!

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,967
Eddie's been wanting to talk to you
ever since he got home from school.
He's in the living room.

8
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:33,012
Hey, Pop! Pop!

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,176
Hey, Pop, could we go on
a camping trip? Could we, huh?
A camping trip?

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,117
Yeah, on account of
you never take me camping.
And today in school,

11
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:43,850
some kids were braggin' about
their parents takin' them
hunting and fishing in the woods.

12
00:00:43,924 --> 00:00:46,950
And all you ever do is take me
on picnics in the cemetery.

13
00:00:47,027 --> 00:00:50,190
Could we, Pop?
Please! Huh?
Well, I, uh...

14
00:00:50,263 --> 00:00:52,891
You know, Herman,
as good parents,

15
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:55,730
maybe we should take Eddie
on a camping trip.

16
00:00:55,802 --> 00:00:59,966
I guess we could put up with
a few days of fresh air... for Eddie's sake.

17
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,476
Oh, boy, could we, Pop?
Could we? Please!

18
00:01:03,543 --> 00:01:05,602
Well, uh, you know, Lily,

19
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:08,273
I just might be able to swing it
this weekend at that.

20
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:10,373
I mean, if any work
piles up down at the shop,

21
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,782
I'll just tell them
to keep it on ice till Monday.

22
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:16,880
Gee, that's neat, Pop.
Wait'll I call the guys
and tell 'em I'm going camping.

23
00:01:19,826 --> 00:01:23,023
Now, Marilyn has to stay home
and study for exams,

24
00:01:23,096 --> 00:01:25,394
but I'm sure Grandpa
will want to go.

25
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:27,956
He just loves
to get close to the soil.

26
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:30,730
You know, Lily,
I think we're all gonna enjoy it.

27
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:33,932
I think it's a good idea
once in a while for the Munsters...

28
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:37,033
to get out and meet nature
face to face.

29
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:40,412
Hmm.
[Sniffs]

30
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:59,350
Uh, Lily, Grandpa and Eddie
have the car all loaded up.

31
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:01,485
They're going to bring it
around front.

32
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:04,758
Marilyn, are you sure you won't
be frightened staying here alone?

33
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:09,393
Of course not, Aunt Lily.
How could I be frightened staying in
a friendly old house like this?

here we come.
[Laughs]

37
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:23,547
Come on in, Herman.
I'll drive for awhile;
then you can take over.

38
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:26,017
Good-bye,
Uncle Herman.
Good-bye, dear.

39
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:31,049
Good-bye, Aunt Lily.

40
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:33,615
Don't forget to feed Spot.
He's no trouble at all...

41
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:37,288
since he learned to open
those pet food cans with his fangs.

42
00:03:38,298 --> 00:03:41,426
Uh, but, dear, keep an eye on him.

43
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:46,097
The last time we left him alone,
he ate the grandfather's clock,
and he ticked for eight days.

44
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:51,241
- Okay. I'll watch him.

Thank you very much.
Enjoy your stay.

47
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:25,409
That guy looked kinda familiar.
Didn't he camp here
a few weeks ago?

48
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:29,278
You got me.
So many people go through here,
one face looks like another to me.

Thank you, my good man.

51

Did I say one face
looks like another?

52
00:04:57,777 --> 00:05:00,837
Fourteen years in this park,
I've never seen anything like that.

53
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:03,280
Maybe I should report this
to Superintendent Haskell.

54
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,911
He always wants to know
about any suspicious-looking
characters that show up.

55
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:11,720
Yeah. Say, uh, you don't think
that was a UCLA debating team
on tour, do you?

56
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,988
I don't know,
but I'm sure going to tell
Mr. Haskell about them.

I asked you never
to pound stakes when I'm around.

60
00:05:35,248 --> 00:05:37,273
You know it gives me heartburn.

61
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,116
Oh, uh, sorry, Grandpa.
I forgot.

62
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:51,330
Pop, when are we
gonna start fishin'?

63
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:56,165
Uh, in a minute, Eddie. As soon as
I'm finished pitching the tent.

64
00:05:56,236 --> 00:06:00,434
Herman, dear, that tent's
right out here in the open
where it's bright and sunny.

65
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:03,806
You really should have pitched it
in the shadow of those trees.

66
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:06,141
Then we could
take advantage of the gloom.

67
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:11,046
You know, you're right, Lily.
I should have thought of it.

68
00:06:11,117 --> 00:06:16,077
You should have mentioned it earlier, Lily.
It's gonna be quite a nuisance
to move the tent now.

69
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:18,886

Before I go off duty,
Mr. Haskell,

83
00:07:56,723 --> 00:08:00,318
I thought you should know
about a party that came in
the east gate this morning.

84
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:02,987
Suspicious-looking bunch?
Well, they sure looked weird.

Rough-looking man,
woman with a cape,

86
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:08,625
some old fella looked like
a warmed-over zombie
and a kid.

87
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:11,033
I'll have the boys
keep an eye out for them.

88
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:15,473
We caught
a wild-looking crowd like that
last year trying to break into the inn.

89
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:20,241
What kind of a car
did they have?
Fancy hot rod. All hopped-up.

90
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:22,247
I'll put the word out.

91

Might be a new kind
of middle-aged juvenile delinquents.

92

Eddie, if you two men
are going to catch some fish
for lunch, you better hurry.

93
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:32,154
Yeah, Pop.
Show me how to cast.

94
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:35,160
All right, son. Come on.

95
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:42,829
Now, to really get distance,

96
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:45,029
you lean back like this...

97
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:47,470

Let's go tell the girls.

Uh-Uh-Uh, that was
just one of my short ones.

Boy, that was neat, Pop!
You can't even see where it went.

See if you get anything.

I ever saw.

00:09:55,942 --> 00:10:01,505
Mm. A-And it seems to be cooked.
I guess they have a lot
of hot springs around here.

- No, we did better than that.

you just can't go running around at night
with a pack of good-for-nothings.

Of course not. Besides,

Oh, Grandpa, you coming?

I'll be going to bed pretty soon.

152

I just want to sit here
a few minutes longer

with me in the Old Country...

Hey, I found a station on the radio.

I didn't think it would work
out here in the woods.

Your grandfather disappeared
during the night.

Uh, where could he have gone?
When we went to bed,
he was sitting right by the fire.

174
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:58,511
I don't know. He kept talking
about the call of the wild,
and he had that funny look in his eye.

[Man On Radio]
We interrupt this program
for a local news bulletin.

in the Shadow Pines area
report the capture...

of a full-grown wolf
during the night.

While several wolves
are known to inhabit this region,

the one now held at
the Shadow Pines Ranger Station...

180

is a rare species whose native habitat
is the wilds of Transylvania.

as to how this animal...

Oh! There's no doubt
about it, Herman.

They're talking
about my father.

00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,138
Mom, can I go to
the ranger station
and pat Grandpa?

spoil my vacation?

he ought to sign up
with Werewolves Anonymous.

do anything, I will.

we patrolled the entire area...

in her sleeping bag.

Yes, miss. May we help you?
I understand from the radio...

204
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:52,854
you picked up
a Transylvanian wolf last night.

That's right. He's out back
in one of our cages.

I'd like to claim him.
He's mine.

- No, he's my father.

but perhaps we better go out

00:21:50,823 --> 00:21:52,814
Thank you.
You can drive on.

299
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:59,559
Well, that's the 50th car
we've checked today so far.
Still no sign of any wolf.

300
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:04,732
Uh-oh. Here comes
that crazy lookin' bunch
that came in the other day.

301
00:22:04,803 --> 00:22:06,737
Better really check this one.

302
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:11,166
Good morning.
Good to see you.

303
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:13,973
Uh, we've enjoyed
your park immensely.

304
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:17,106
Fine. Mind if we
take a look inside?

305
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:19,650
Not at all.
Uh, be our guest.

306
00:22:27,526 --> 00:22:30,256
Hi there.
Hi.

307
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:33,765
Is that a kid?
Well, it's not quite a wolf.

308
00:22:36,368 --> 00:22:40,099
Okay. You can go.
Oh, uh, thank you.

309
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:42,106
Good day.
[Chuckles]

310
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:51,840
Lily, i-i-it's all right.

311
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:54,215
W-We're safe now.
[Laughs]

312
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:58,552
All right, Grandpa.
You can let go of your tail now.
[Whines]

313
00:22:58,624 --> 00:23:03,527
Easy does it, Grandpa.
Grandpa!
[Whining]

314
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:06,888
Easy does it.
Easy-Easy does it.
That's right.

315
00:23:08,434 --> 00:23:12,996
[Whines]
Grandpa, I am not going too fast.
And don't be a front seat driver.

316
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:18,402
And then your Uncle Herman
got Grandpa out of his cage,

317
00:23:18,477 --> 00:23:22,174
but the rangers were looking for him,
so we had to smuggle him out of the park.

318
00:23:22,247 --> 00:23:27,048
Oh, that's a shame, Aunt Lily.
So many annoying little things
can happen on a picnic.

319
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,078
Did you find anything, Herman?
Yes, I found Grandpa's
de-wolfing potion.

320
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:35,149
This ought to do the trick.
Sure hope it
turns him back again.

321
00:23:35,227 --> 00:23:37,161
Certainly hope so.

322
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:41,290
I'd hate to have to take Grandpa
out for a walk every night
for the rest of my life.

323
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:43,561
[Whining]
What did he say?

324
00:23:43,635 --> 00:23:45,626
He said, "I'll drink to that."

325
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:00,981
Well, go ahead, Grandpa.
Get with it.

326
00:24:02,821 --> 00:24:04,846
- [Meows]
- [Barking]

327
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,644
What happened?

328
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:28,839
One minute I'm out
in the woods,

329
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:31,314
next thing I'm here
chasing a cat.

330
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:34,079
Uh, well, you see, Grandpa...
Herman.

331
00:24:34,153 --> 00:24:36,621
Don't tell him. It's too awful.

332
00:24:36,688 --> 00:24:38,622
Uh, all I can tell you is...

333
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,420
that if you ever pull
a stunt like this again,

334
00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:43,961
your zip code address is
gonna be the Central Park Zoo!
