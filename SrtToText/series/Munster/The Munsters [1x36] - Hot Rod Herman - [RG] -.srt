Sandy Baylor's father is a drag racer.

I told him my pop
could beat his dad anytime,

'cause you're the best
driver in the world.

The fellow Herman's gonna race today
is a professional driver.

Oh! Oh, dear.

162
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:57,859
When Herman finds that out,
I hope he has the sense
to call the whole thing off.

"Sense"? Any grown man who still expects
quarters from the tooth fairy...

ain't exactly an Einstein.

Uncle Herman, this is just terrible.

Didn't you know that that man
was a professional race driver?

176
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:30,722
No, I didn't know that.
I thought he was just
another goof like I was.

177
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,385
Herman, this is
the worst thing you've done...

178
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,088
since you bought us
that mausoleum at the cemetery,

179
00:13:37,163 --> 00:13:40,599
and we couldn't move in because
there were no kitchen privileges.

180
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:44,432
How did I know it was
a restrictive community,
and they wouldn't take live people?

Yeah.

They've asked Eddie for his bicycle.

They took the pipes out of the organ
in the living room.

get your rival to commit himself
on the bet,

a little wager on that?

his chute is missing.

00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:23,744
Herman, son-in-law, baby,
you saved my life.

308
00:23:24,817 --> 00:23:26,808
Of course, Grandpa.

309
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:32,049
What else could I do?

310
00:23:32,124 --> 00:23:36,117
I have to have
this box back in the parlor
first thing Monday morning.

311
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:45,602
It was very naughty of you, Herman,
to lose our car at the drag races.

312
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:48,401
Thanks to Grandpa,
we have it back now.

313
00:23:48,474 --> 00:23:50,965
Lily, please,
let's not bring up the past.

314
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:54,444
For once in this family,
let's let the dead stay buried.

315
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:58,279
Good idea.
I just hope our car wasn't hurt
in all those races.

316
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,978
Yes. And it's a beautiful car.

317
00:24:01,053 --> 00:24:05,319
Have you ever noticed the way
everybody turns and stares at us
when we drive by?

318
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:08,826
Lily, there's no harm done.
A little racing is good for a car.

319
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:11,021
It only serves to loosen up
the engine.

320
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:13,030
Let's go, Pop.

321
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:16,261
We wanna get to the cemetery
before all the good spots are taken.

322
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:18,326
Right, Eddie.
