1
00:00:17,397 --> 00:00:21,197
Thanks for the lift, Charlie.
Pick me up around 9:00
tomorrow morning.

2
00:00:26,106 --> 00:00:28,666
Lily, pussycat is home.

3
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:36,741
Good evening, dear.
Good evening, dear.

4
00:00:36,817 --> 00:00:39,377
I see the carpool
dropped you off again.

5
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:42,650
Yes, and it was quite
restful riding in the back.

6
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:50,259
Oh! Mail, dear?

7
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,299
No, but it's something
I'm very upset about.

8
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:56,495
I was putting up
some new cobwebs
in Marilyn's room,

9
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,734
and I, um, accidentally found this
hidden in her bureau drawer.

10
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:03,503
Oh, a love letter.
[Laughs]

11
00:01:03,577 --> 00:01:06,068
Let's read it.
Herman,
it's not a love letter.

12
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:09,547
It's an announcement
of a parents' night
at Marilyn's school.

13
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:12,949
It's next Saturday night
and she hasn't even asked us yet.

14
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:17,752
I have a feeling she doesn't
want us to be seen at her school
for some strange reason.

15
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:21,123
And I think we ought to get
to the bottom of this at supper.

16
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:23,355
Well, it may not be
that serious, Lily.

17
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,660
L-It may just have
slipped her mind.

18
00:01:25,732 --> 00:01:27,927
Things are always
popping out of my head.

19
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:31,334
Yes, but with you,
we can always put them back in.

20
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:40,739
Now remember, Herman,

21
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:45,574
we have to find out why Marilyn
hasn't mentioned parents' night
at school.

22
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:48,113
But we have to be
very subtle about it.

23
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:50,274
Be very subtle. I see.

24
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:54,344
How do we do that?

25
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:56,446
Well, we lead up
to it gradually.

26
00:02:56,523 --> 00:03:00,186
First I'll bring up
the subject of cars.
Cars.

27
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,718
That'll lead to driving.
Driving.

28
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:09,235
And then I'll bring up
the subject of driving to school.
Driving to school. Of course.

29
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:11,532
And that'll lead up to...

30
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:13,766
[Together]
Parents' night.

31
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,240
Gotcha.
[Door Opens]

32
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:20,109
Oh, my! Everything looks
so delicious, Lily.

33
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,148
Oh, thank you,
Grandpa.

34
00:03:27,387 --> 00:03:29,252
[Clears Throat]

35
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:36,051
Uh, Marilyn, how do you feel
about the new cars?

36
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:39,155
New cars?
Well, I think that...

37
00:03:39,232 --> 00:03:41,928
And how come you didn't
ask us to parents' night at school?

38
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:47,673
Parents'night? Well,
where did you hear about that?

39
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:51,040
Well... Well, dear,
I was dusting your room,

40
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:53,545
and I just happened
to come across the invitation.

41
00:03:53,613 --> 00:03:56,480
It's, uh, next Saturday night,
isn't it?

42
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,883
Yes, Marilyn.
Don't try to hide anything.

43
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:04,356
You know, in this family
nothing ever stays buried.

44
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:06,551
The reason I didn't mention it
was because...

45
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:09,356
Well, because of you,
Uncle Herman.

46
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:14,298
Me? Well, why wouldn't you
want me, of all people,
to go to parents' night?

47
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:16,835
Well, I just didn't think
you'd care for it.

48
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:19,394
It's going to be sort of
a dinner dance.

49
00:04:19,472 --> 00:04:22,407
Oh. [Chuckles]
Dancing.

50
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:26,844
Why didn't you say so?
Dancing has never been
one of my strong points.

51
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:30,076
I guess you could say
I have two left feet.

52
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,813
Well, that's what happens
when they put someone
together in the dark.

53
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:36,288
Herman,

54
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:39,825
I think we should go.

55
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:43,795
I mean, at your age,
it's high time you took up dancing.

56
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:47,731
Lily, you know I hate dancing.
I've always hated to dance.

57
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:53,239
I'm not going through with it.
I am not going down there
at the risk of making a fool out of myself.

58
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:55,706
I am not going dancing!

59
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:04,075
And one, two, three.

60
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,143
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

61
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:10,348
One, two, three. One...

62
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:13,620
Herman. Herman, relax.
You're so stiff.

63
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:15,752
Yeah, Herman, let everything go.

64
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:17,763
Well, I'll-I'll try,

65
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:20,959
but the last time I let everything go,
some of it didn't come back.

66
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:28,900
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

67

One, two, three.

68
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:36,579
One, two, three.
One, two...

I think I'm getting the knack of it.

You know something, Lily,

76
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:13,242
I just got a new respect
for Lawrence Welk.

77
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:17,784
Marilyn, Eddie!
What happened?

78
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:20,348
Come and help
your Uncle Herman.

79
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:22,361
Careful.

Listen, Lily.
They're playing our song.

82
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:33,305
Ah!

83
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:37,173
If that Herman wants to dance,
I'll mix him something
that'll make him dance.

84
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:40,371
Ho, ho! Now, let me see.
Ah, yes, now I know.

85
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:43,706
A little potassium.

?? [Humming]

87
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:48,816
A pinch of chlorophyll.

88
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:54,585
Two fingers of Geritol.

89
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,664
A dash of bitters.

90
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,660
And now for the secret ingredient!

91
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:08,566
A pair of Fred Astaire's
dancing shoes.

92

[Shoes Tapping, Shuffling]

Grandpa?

95
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:27,156
Grandpa, are you
making lasagna again?
You're smelling up the whole house.

96
00:07:28,962 --> 00:07:33,763
No, as a matter of fact, I'm whipping up
a batch of my secret dancing potion.

97
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,768
This will make you
a wonderful dancer.

98
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:39,999
No, sir. I'm not drinking
anything you mix up.

99
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:43,736
Okay. Go to
the parents' night dance.

100
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,745
Disgrace poor Marilyn.
Make a fool of yourself.

101

I'm not gonna
disgrace anybody.
Listen to this.

102
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,841
I found an ad in the newspaper,
and they're gonna make me...

Herman, listen to me.

00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:13,599
There are plenty
of good dancing schools,

110
00:08:13,673 --> 00:08:16,301
but you gotta watch out
for the shysters.

Okay. If that's
what you want to do.

Miss Valentine,

122
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:05,724
since you're a new instructor
here at Happyland, I'd like to
acquaint you with our policy.

123
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:08,192
Most of our clients are older people,

124
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:11,196
misfits, widowers,
people searching for friendship.

125
00:09:11,264 --> 00:09:14,893
Some are rather bewildered,
and they come to us looking for guidance.

126
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:16,993
We have a definite approach
to these folks.

127
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,938
- What's that, Doctor?
- We take 'em for all they've got.

128
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:24,075
Uncle Herman left early,
didn't he?

129
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:27,977
Yes, the sweet thing went downtown
to take dancing lessons.

130
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:31,414
He's so anxious
to make a good impression
at the parents' night dance.

131
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:34,248
I'm surprised that he never learned
to dance when he was younger.

132
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,154
Well, when other young men
were going to parties and dances,

133
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:40,715
I'm afraid he was always tied up
in the laboratory.

134
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:45,920
You know, they have
women teachers down
at those dancing schools.

135
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:50,265
I just hope one of them
doesn't fall in love with
your Uncle Herman's gentle charms.

136
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:54,272
[Screams]
Doctor Havemeyer.!
Doctor Havemeyer.!

137
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,504
Calm down, Miss Valentine.
What happened?

138
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:02,207
Well, l-I know you said
there'd be a lot of weirdos
and misfits around here,

139
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:05,547
but you should've seen
what just walked in
and wanted to take dancing lessons.

140
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:08,746
You gotta see him!
Now, now. There's no need
for me to see him.

141
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:10,914
Didn't I tell you
to expect all kinds?

142
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,289
Now, you get back in there,
turn on the charm.

143
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,193
Flatter him. Tell him
how great a dancer he is.

144
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:21,063
And then when you got him hooked,
get him to sign our 10-year contract.

145
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:24,900
[Chuckles]
Well, I'll try.

146
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:28,600
It's times like this I wish I'd stayed
with the Roller Derby.

147
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:32,944
Oh, there you are, miss.

148
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:36,709
Was there some emergency?
You left here so fast,
I thought the place was on fire.

149
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:38,944
[Laughs]
No such luck.

150
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:41,350
Well, shall we start?
Alrighty.

00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:55,891
Yeah, that's better.
Now, the first thing you have to do
is put your arm around me.

Oh, uh...

do that once.

Tell me, Mr. Munster,
have you ever danced professionally?

Professionally?
Heavens no!

164
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:35,840
I would have
never known.

165

Yoo-hoo, Lily. I'm home.

Oh, welcome home, dear.

169
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:55,825
Well, how did my sweetheart
make out at dancing class?

170
00:11:55,895 --> 00:11:59,262
How did I make out?
I made out just beautifully, Lily.

171
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:03,792
Miss Valentine said
after just one lesson,
I was a natural born dancer.

172
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,704
She's never seen such a talent.
Oh, that's wonderful!

173
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:10,538
I just know that when I
dance with you at the ball,

174
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,078
every eye in the room
will be on us.

175
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:16,081
And, Lily, Miss Valentine
said that Dr. Havemeyer...

176
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:19,312
might even make me a teacher
after a few more lessons.

177
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:21,148
A teacher!

178

And, Lily, I was reading today
in a fan magazine...

179
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:28,623
You know, that's the way
Gene Kelly started out...
as a dancing teacher.

180
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:30,958
Then he starred in Pal Joey,

181
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,863
then he was a big smash
in For Me and My Gal,

182
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:37,266
and then there was
Gene's biggest hit,
Singing in the Rain.

183
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:42,740
? I'm singing in the rain
just singing in the rain?

184
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:46,870
? What a glorious feeling
I'm happy again?

185
00:12:46,946 --> 00:12:50,814
? I'm laughing at clouds?

and I'm ready for love??

would like you to sign up
for a special course.

Wrong? It's this contract
that Herman signed
with the dancing school.

He signed a 10-year contract
for 1,500 lessons...

at 750 a lesson!

More?

A life insurance policy
naming the school as benefiiciary.

232
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:26,394
In case of default,
a garnishee on Herman's salary.

233
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:30,925
A lien on his home.
An attachment on his automobile.

234
00:16:32,204 --> 00:16:35,002
And in case of any legal action,

235
00:16:35,074 --> 00:16:38,908
a waiver of all his rights
as an American citizen.

Well, we just can't let him
know he's been taken.

he's liable to go right into his shell.

into a swamp.

Then I'll turn all the other teachers
into lizards.

that the cops are going to
run an investigation on us.

256
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:49,608
Look, what they usually do is
they get an investigator
to pose as a student.

get out of his own way.

We take desperate measures.

We turn honest.

We tell him after
analyzing his dancing,

276
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:08,049
we find out that he
has absolutely no talent,

You mean I won't
be a dancing teacher?

280
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:26,441
No. Upon analysis, we find your dancing
to be crude and awkward.

00:19:26,512 --> 00:19:28,912
And your coordination is atrocious.

and then get to Hollywood,

00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:37,815
Well, that's a good idea, Marilyn.

303
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:41,114
The last time a young man
came to our house to pick you up,

304
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:44,917
he had some sort of an attack
right on our front porch.

305
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,982
Oh, I wonder if Uncle Herman
has the car out yet.

306
00:20:51,196 --> 00:20:53,221
Why, Herman, you're not
even dressed yet.

307
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:55,767
Yes, Uncle Herman.
And we're due there now.

308
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:58,769
I'm sorry, girls.
I'm not going.

309
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:02,671
Not going? But we've been
looking forward to this all week,

310
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:04,902
and you took
all those dancing lessons.

311
00:21:04,977 --> 00:21:07,878
And you brought that tuxedo home
from the parlor and everything.

312
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:13,317
Well, Herman has
something to tell you about
the dancing school.

313
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:17,822
Well, the truth is that last night,
they tore up my 10-year contract,

314
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,553
gave me back the money
and told me to get lost.

315
00:21:21,627 --> 00:21:25,324
Oh, well, that was
just a phony school.

316
00:21:25,397 --> 00:21:28,366
W-Well, that doesn't matter.
W-What does matter is...

317
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:32,803
they showed me that I must
face the truth about myself.

318
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:37,433
And I realize that when you
add it up on the scoreboard of life,

319
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:41,639
Herman Munster is just
a big, awkward clod.

320
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:46,139
Oh, darling,
you are not at all.

321
00:21:46,218 --> 00:21:51,622
Well, uh, be that as it may,
l-I want you to go to the dance, Lily,
and you, Marilyn,

322
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,715
and enjoy yourselves...

323
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:57,250
amidst the lights
and the music and the gaiety.

324
00:21:57,329 --> 00:21:59,820
But, pussycat...
No, no. No, no.

325
00:21:59,898 --> 00:22:03,857
Lily, I want you to go.
L-I insist.

326
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:06,837
And, uh, if, during the evening,
some attractive gentlemen...

327
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:09,897
comes up to you
and asks you to dance,

328
00:22:09,975 --> 00:22:12,705
I want you to feel free to accept.

329
00:22:12,778 --> 00:22:16,874
And, uh, while you're dancing,
and he's holding you tight,

330
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:19,474
I don't want you
to give one moment's thought...

331
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:21,712
to your faithful husband
sitting here alone...

332
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:25,814
with his shriveled-up
old father-in-law.

333
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:28,257
Herman, you're all heart.

334
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:30,352
Oh, but, Uncle Herman...

335
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:35,059
No, no. Go... out the door
and don't look back.

336
00:22:36,268 --> 00:22:39,704
Well, all right, Herman,
if you insist.

337
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:41,797
Come on, Marilyn.

338
00:22:44,043 --> 00:22:45,977
[Door Opens, Closes]

339
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:50,470
You know, shrivel...
l-I mean, Grandpa...

340
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:53,882
it gives me a good feeling inside
knowing I did the right thing.

341
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,785
[Caws]
What a cornball.!

342
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,615
[Lily]
Owwww.!

343
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:02,684
[Marilyn]
Grandpa, Herman.

344
00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:04,695
Aunt Lily fell on
the front porch.

345
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:08,392
What happened?
Is she all right?
Well, I think she sprained her ankle.

346
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:12,198
Oooh.! Oooh. Oooh.

347
00:23:12,271 --> 00:23:14,330
Just help me
to the sofa, Herman.

348
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:16,670
I don't know
how it happened.

349
00:23:19,311 --> 00:23:22,439
Grandpa, wasn't that
noble of Aunt Lily?

350
00:23:22,514 --> 00:23:25,142
You mean about her
not making a fuss
about her ankle?

351
00:23:25,217 --> 00:23:27,515
Oh, no. Because she pretended...

352
00:23:27,586 --> 00:23:31,317
that she sprained her ankle
so she could stay home
with Uncle Herman.

353
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,552
Oh, boy!

354
00:23:35,627 --> 00:23:38,926
This family's come a long way
from Transylvania...

355
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:41,522
when we used to pound stakes
into each other.

356
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:52,405
Now, Eddie, watch this.
Just watch this.

357
00:23:52,478 --> 00:23:57,438
Herman, what are you and Eddie
doing out here
in all this bright sunlight?

358
00:23:57,516 --> 00:23:59,575
Daddy's practicin' baseball.

359
00:23:59,651 --> 00:24:04,611
That's right, Lily.
There's a father and son
baseball game at Eddie's school,

360
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,624
and I'm gonna be ready.

361
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:10,788
I'm not gonna make a fool
of myself the way I did last week
at Marilyn's dance.

362
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:13,093
Well, you be careful now, Herman.

363
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:17,067
Lily, please.
This is my game.

364
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,300
Just watch this.
[Laughs]

365
00:24:38,323 --> 00:24:40,314
Should I bring him
in the house, Mom?

366
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:45,056
No, Eddie, just leave him there.
The carpool will be by
in 10 minutes to pick him up.
