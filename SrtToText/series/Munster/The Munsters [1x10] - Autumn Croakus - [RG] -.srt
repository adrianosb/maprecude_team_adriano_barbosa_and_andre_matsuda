Herman!
I'm coming, dear.
I'm coming.

00:00:26,907 --> 00:00:29,842
I couldn't get the lid closed.
Now, do you have the potato salad?

5
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,969
Yes, dear.
Do you have the pickles?

00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:33,979
Yes, dear.
Are we going someplace?

Yes, Grandpa.
It's such a nice day.

to the beach.

You're not taking me?
Grandpa, you know
you never enjoy the beach.

All you ever do when you get there
is bury yourself in the sand.

Coming, dear?
Bye, Grandpa.

I'll stay home and play checkers

I'm right here, Grandpa.

Eddie, how about you going to find Marilyn,
and then the three of us...

will have a checker tournament?

Oh, Marilyn went out
with her new boyfriend.

with one of the neighbor kids.

I told you before.
It's not neighborly.

Well, I think it's disgraceful,
beneath the family's dignity.

Well, you can stand there
and ask that?

You bring a sensitive,
impressionable woman here

We've had a lot of comment
on it from the neighbors.

It's a gracious tribute to the age
of this lovely old home...

years to get it this way.

Of course,
they could only work on it nights.

so that you and Grandfather

Oh, that's a splendid idea.

There are a couple of things

You received our insurance forms
and the last will and testament blank?

Good. Well, I'll tell you what. Steve.
Now, if you'll just sign them
and have them notarized and...

149

What's that? Oh, beneficiary.
Oh, it's printed right on the forms.

00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:43,421
Good-bye.

152
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:47,448
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, baby.

153
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:51,588
[Laughing]
Hello.

154
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:54,531
Well, did you meet
your latest husband-to-be?
Mm-hmm.

155
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,535
Perfectly dreadful house,
but he'll be a pushover.

156
00:10:57,603 --> 00:11:00,697
Looks like he has
one foot in the grave already.
Good.

157
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:04,834
This one will make five men
married and "morgued"
in the past three months.

158
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:10,242
Malcolm, I'm thinking of a way
to save at least a day and a half
on each operation.
Uh-huh.

159
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:12,910
Get them to combine the funeral
with the reading of the will.

160
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:15,477
Lydia, that's brilliant.
How do you think of things like this?

161
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:19,924
Very simple. All you need
is an attorney who plays the organ.

162
00:11:19,993 --> 00:11:22,052
Here's his picture back.
[Sighs]

163
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:25,097
Better put it in the file
with his letter.
[Chuckles]

164
00:11:25,164 --> 00:11:28,099
[Inhales]
Hmm.

165
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:39,144
You know, honey, this one keeps
reminding me of Poochy Dowling.
[Chuckles]

166
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:41,544
Wouldn't you say this fellow
looks a lot like Poochy, hmm?

167
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:43,775
You mean the way the way he looked
when I pushed him...

168
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,513
[Clicks Tongue]
I mean, when he fell off his yacht
on our honeymoon cruise?

169
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:50,886
Uh, no. No, more the way
he looked a week later,

170
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:53,323
when they fished him out of the water.

171
00:11:57,497 --> 00:11:59,863
?? [Humming]

172
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:06,528
Lily, stop fussing, will you?
What are you so grumpy about?

173
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:08,540
I just want
the house to look nice.
Eh.

174
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:11,076
It's all this paperwork
Lydia brought with her...

175
00:12:11,144 --> 00:12:13,669
insurance,
last will and testament.

176
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:16,214
I tell you... getting married
is not what it used to be.

177
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:18,443
I thought all you
had to do was take a blood test,

178
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:21,282
and I was kinda
looking forward to that.

179
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:23,754
Well, that's that.

180
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:27,384
But Lydia's a darling.
She's worth all the red tape.

181
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,920
We'll be as sweet and cozy
as two little bats in a cave.

182
00:12:31,998 --> 00:12:34,558
I'm sure you will.
[Chuckles]

183
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:38,570
[Door Creaking]
Hello, dear. Grandpa.

184
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:41,266
Well, back from
the salt mines again.
[Chuckles]

185
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:46,607
Mmm!
Fresh weeds, do we have company?

186
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:52,049
Hardly.
More like a close relative,
uh, wouldn't you say, Lily?

187
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:54,951
Yes.
Grandpa's intended
is in the kitchen.

188
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:57,888
[Chuckles]
I want you to meet her, Herman.

189
00:12:57,957 --> 00:13:00,926
His mail-order bride is in this house?

190
00:13:00,993 --> 00:13:03,621
- I'm disgusted.
- ?? [Humming "Wedding March"]

191
00:13:03,696 --> 00:13:05,857
And I want no part of it.

192
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:08,025
If I was ever to lower myself
to meet that woman,

193
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:11,400
- I could never face myself again.
- Herman, she's going to be...

194
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:15,567
How could you do this to me, Lily?
And how could you do this
to the memory of Grandmother?

195
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:19,702
I am never gonna meet that woman,
and I'm putting my foot down right now!

196
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:23,208
Oh!

197
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:28,310
[Floorboard Splinters]

198
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:30,321
Oh, darn!

199
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:32,323
Excuse me.

200
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,927
Lily, give Herman time.
Lydia'll be around with us for a while.

201
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,468
He's bound to run
into her sooner or later.

202
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:52,576
Oh.
Oh, how nice!

203
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:54,579
Just wanted to be helpful.

204
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:56,774
Oh, eh,
by the way, eh, uh,

205
00:13:56,849 --> 00:13:58,874
I signed all the papers
you gave me.

206
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:00,885
[Air Kiss]

207
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:05,083
Here. Nothing like
a little bite before dinner.
[Chuckles]

208
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:07,092
No, no, no, dear!

209
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,526
Uh, I made this
just for Grandpa.

210
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:11,825
Thank you, dear.
Go away, kitty.

211
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:13,991
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

212
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:16,159
[Roars]

213
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,701
Don't mind Kitty.
She's just like one of the family.

214
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:26,135
[Chuckles]
Oh, I just can't get over...

215
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:29,306
how utterly charming
this place is.

216
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:31,850
These antiques
must be worth a fortune,

217
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:34,478
if one should decide
to sell them.

218
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:39,321
We do have a lot of valuable pieces,
but everything here isn't an antique.

219
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:42,190
Um, oh, well,
that chair for instance...

220
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:45,788
that's just something Grandpa
picked up at a prison surplus store.

221
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:48,095
It isn't even plugged in.

222
00:14:49,135 --> 00:14:52,400
How quaint.
Incidentally, Mrs. Munster,

223
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:54,803
uh, where is your husband?

224
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:58,401
Oh, Herman was so sorry
he couldn't be here to greet you,

225
00:14:58,477 --> 00:15:02,174
but he had one of his wretched
headaches, and he had to retire early.

226
00:15:02,248 --> 00:15:04,307
[Clicks Tongue]
Oh, I'm so sorry.

227
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:07,477
Uh, do any other members
of your family live with you?

228
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:11,250
No, they're all dead.
I see.
Passed away?

229
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:14,760
No, they haven't gone anywhere.
They're just dead.

230
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:18,663
Well now, Lydia, darling.

231
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:21,165
Come with me,
and I'll show you to your room.

232
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:24,567
Grandpa, let's put Lydia
in the guest room.

233
00:15:24,637 --> 00:15:27,470
Oh... Oh, it's on
the sunny side of the house.

234
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,031
I hope you won't
mind too much.

235
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:32,304
Uh, no.

236
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:34,903
Oh, that will be fine.
Good. Good.
[Chuckles]

237
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:37,779
Come right this way.

238
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,685
You know, you remind me
of someone very dear,
someone I lost.

239
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:44,746
Do you mind
if I call you Poochy?

240

[Roars]

241
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:55,797
Aunt Lily,
I still don't know about that woman.

242
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:58,393
There's something
that just hits a false note.

243
00:15:58,471 --> 00:16:02,305
Marilyn, you've got to stop
being so critical of people.

244
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,366
Oh, Aunt Lily,
you're so ingenuous.

[Creaking]

246
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:23,559
Herman?

247
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:27,565
What?
Listen.

248
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,863
[Faint Footsteps]

249
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:32,904
I don't hear anything.
That's it!

250
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:35,406
The shutters
have stopped squeaking.

251
00:16:35,474 --> 00:16:38,500
Lily, you're always not hearing things.

252
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:41,068
Go to sleep.

00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:56,517
Malcolm, I made the old boy
an avocado mickey, but he didn't take it.

255
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:59,564
So, I'm going to arrange
the accident right away.

256
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:05,228
I told him I'm a very heavy sleeper,
and I don't want to miss
an important phone call...

257
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:08,364
from my dear sister in California.

258
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:12,343
So, Malcolm, you dial this number
in just ten minutes.

259
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:15,847
He'll come hurrying downstairs
to answer the phone.

260
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:20,352
It'll be slip, slide, crash, bang,
and by this time tomorrow,
the estate will be in probate.

261
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:23,479
Never could sleep on an empty stomach.

262
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:27,125
But I couldn't eat dinner
with that woman.

263
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:31,692
And I hope Grandpa doesn't marry her.

264
00:17:39,905 --> 00:17:44,205
Marilyn... I keep telling her
to put the phone back.

Now, you stay out there
and be a nice kitty.

00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:51,001
And drink all your milk!

You'll wake the dead!

00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:22,720
You know, Lily, this house
is very strange tonight.

275
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:25,355
It's also very noisy, thanks to you.

276
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:29,094
Well, if a man can't have a sandwich
in his own house...
[Chuckles]

277
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:32,467
If a man would eat his dinner
when he was supposed to.

278
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:36,497
I don't like to eat
with strangers.
Ohh.

279
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:40,739
One sweet, little stranger,
who is about to become
a member of the family...

280
00:21:40,813 --> 00:21:44,943
whether you like it or not.
That's right.
Ignore my opinion.

281
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:48,509
Make me feel unwanted,
like an intruder.

282
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:52,250
If you're an intruder, then you'd
better find someplace else to sleep,

283
00:21:52,324 --> 00:21:56,784
because this room
is reserved for my husband!
Well!

284
00:21:56,862 --> 00:22:00,025
If that's the way
you feel about it,

285
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:03,193
I'll just go downstairs
and sleep on the sofa.

286
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:22,250
Why should I have to spend
the night on a short, lumpy sofa?

287
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:25,119
I'll use the guest room.

what have you done?
Not a thing!

[Banging]
Oh, I'll get it.

296
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:22,613
Lydia's gone!
What did you say to her?
I didn't say a word.

297
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:25,081
She just looked at me,
screamed and ran out.

Let me go!

Oh, good evening, miss.
We wanted to let you know
we got her,

- and she confessed to everything.
- Got her?

00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:38,689
- Mrs. Gardner!
- "Mrs. Gardner"? Ha!
"Black Widow" Gardner.

302
00:23:38,764 --> 00:23:41,995
Your Grandpa wasn't the first man
she tried to marry just to get his dough.

303
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:44,399
[Cop #1]
We picked up her accomplice,
and he said she was here.

304
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,904
Just as we drove up, she came
busting out of the house.

305
00:23:46,972 --> 00:23:50,100
- You mean she's
some kind of a swindler?
- The queen of them all.

306
00:23:50,175 --> 00:23:53,611
You know, your grandfather's
the only one she hasn't managed
to do away with.

307
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,614
I thought all that sweetness
was too good to be true.

308
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:58,616
You know,
I hate to tell you this, miss,

309
00:23:58,684 --> 00:24:01,118
but she thinks you've got
a monster in that house.

310
00:24:01,186 --> 00:24:04,246
A monster?
Oh, that's ridiculous.

311
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:06,848
- There's nobody in here but my family.
- That's what we figured.

312
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:10,053
She's just trying to build up
an insanity plea to make it easy
for herself.

313
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:12,757
Well, good night, miss.
Come on, Mrs. Gardner.

314
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:16,528
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
I couldn't face him again.

315
00:24:16,602 --> 00:24:19,537
[Lydia Muttering, Indistinct]

316
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:23,132
Good night!
And thank you!

317
00:24:27,446 --> 00:24:30,381
Did that policeman say that-that
Lydia was trying to kill me?

318
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:34,215
I'm sorry, Grandpa,
but she was the notorious "Black Widow."

319
00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:38,347
See? I told you.
You can't be too careful.

320
00:24:38,423 --> 00:24:42,689
When you think of some of the people
running around loose
in the world today... Ha...

321
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:45,229
it's frightening.
