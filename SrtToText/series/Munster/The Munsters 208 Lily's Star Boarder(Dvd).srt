[Lily chattering]

00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,944
(Lily) That's what I will do.
I'll redecorate.

6
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,418
We sure could use
the extra money.

7
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,751
I think it's
a wonderful idea.

8
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,087
Then we all agree.

9
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,058
Hi, everybody.
Herman's home.

10
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:52,528
Another thing, having a person
here would be a wonderful thing.

11
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:56,857
I said the breadwinner's here. It'll
be a good thing for the whole family.

12
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:59,836
I'm home! I'm home!
I'm home! I'm home! I'm home!

13
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,207
Herman, you're here.
Why didn't you let us know?

14
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:06,972
I was trying... Never mind.
What's going on here?

15
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,604
We've decided
to rent our guest room.

16
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,538
Lily, dear...

17
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,514
lam head of the house...

18
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:17,385
and there will be no decision
made here without my okay.

19
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:25,757
The Munsters are not gonna rent their
guest room while I'm still boss.

20
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,726
I declare the issue closed!

21
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,205
Whoever we rent it to,
I sure hope he's a live one.

00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:42,813
The head of the house says, "lssue

25
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:43,973
Oh.

26
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,812
Here's the ad
I put in this morning.

27
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:49,115
Is anyone listening to me? They
sure put it in a good spot.

28
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,620
All right. All right.
All right.

29
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,748
Nobody here is
listening to me...

30
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:57,261
and if nobody listens to me, I'm
gonna storm right up to my room.

31
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,729
What was Herman
yelling about?

32
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,172
I don't know. Something about
a storm up in his room.

33
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:17,306
I can't storm right up to my room.
I haven't had din-din.

34
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,038
I just can't understand it.

35
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,415
We've had 27 people
answer our ad...

36
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,318
and not one wants to come
past the front door.

37
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,722
Maybe when they see us all
at once, it scares them off.

38
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,495
Grandpa, how could we
scare anyone off?

39
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:43,364
Class, Lily, we're dripping with class.
That frightens the common man.

It's just Spot.

46
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,310
He's chasing cars again,
being playful.

47
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,870
I'd wish he'd stop
eating those hubcaps.

48
00:03:56,936 --> 00:04:01,043

Oh, dear, now he's
stealing car bumpers.

52
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,598
He can't help it.
He has an iron deficiency.

With a northern exposure.
I'll take it.

All right, get lost. We've had a
lot of bums before you turn us--

You'll take it?

How do you like this guy?

63
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:07,483
We hit him with all our class and
sophistication, and he stands his ground.

What kind of work do you do, Mr...
Skinner.

65

Chester Skinner.
I work at night.

66
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:17,222
And I also have a very unusual,
but confidential, occupation.

May I show you to your room?
Thank you.

If there's anything I can do for
you, now you please call me.

Thank you very much.

72
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,646
Is there a phone in here?
Yes.

73
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,807
We put one in when we
decided to rent the room.

74
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,511
That will save you from running
down to the coffin in the hall.

this is Chester Skinner.

00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,768
Yes, I have the room.

79
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,878
The landlords are a little strange and
the house is like an open grave...

00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,476
but it's perfect
for our operation.

All right. Everything is
running smoothly so far.

You mean to say our tenant's been
with us for two whole days...

86
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,210
and he won't tell you
what he does for a living?

87
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,914
That's just plain old sneaky.

88
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,486
Chester. I think
he's just wonderful.

89
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,089
Sneaky. Sneaky.
Sneaky. Sneaky.

He's so charming, he has
such wonderful manners...

91
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,358
and so handy around the house.
"Chester's so handy around the house."

92
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,661
Chester sounds to me
like a big frump.

93
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,139
When I get home from school,
he plays catch with me...

94
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,473
and he helps me with my homework.
Frump. Frump. Frump. Frump.

95
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,680
Herman, you are jealous.

96
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,579
Heck if I am.
Sure you are.

97
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,175
You're jealous 'cause
everybody likes Chester.

98
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,249
I think Grandpa's
right, Herman.

99
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,721
I am not jealous.

100
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,617
Why should I care if some...

101
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:31,719
smooth-mannered, well-talking
tenant moves right in...

102
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:35,027
and tries to take over my
image as ruler of the roost.

103
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:40,293
Chester is not trying to take over, Herman.
He's just a nice man.

104
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,003
How nice?

105
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,969
All right, Herman.
Not as nice as you are.

106
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,570
That's better.

107
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,310
Marilyn?

108
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:56,945
You're wonderfully nice, Uncle Herman,
in a different sort of a way.

109
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,818
That's what I like to hear.

110
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,252
Eddie?

111
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,488
Chester's cool, Dad,
but you're the coolest.

112
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,194
I'll accept that.

113
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,327
Grandpa?

114
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,463
I pass.

115
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:17,132
Now, I'm warning you, Grandpa. Don't
push me too far or you'll be sorry.

116
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,369
I'm liable to storm
right up to my room again.

Then I'll eat your dessert.

120

Before I go to work...

121
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,865
I would like to say to everyone that
I'm sorry the way I acted last night.

122
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:56,342
I guess I'm just a silly fool
who's starved for affection.

Sensitive...
(Marilyn) Poor baby.

124
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:03,284
Actually, I would like to
meet Chester before I go.

125
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,791
I've decided that we should all
be adult about this whole thing.

126
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:12,619
You can't meet him, dear.
Poor Chester worked all night.

127
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,289
And he said he wanted to
get a good rest...

128
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:17,129
before he helps me
around the house today.

[scoffs]

130
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,562
Fine.

131
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:28,771
But, let's not get
too adult around here.

132
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,018
(Marilyn) Bye, Uncle Herman.
Bye, have a nice day.

133
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,629
I'm going to work now.

134
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:55,966
It's me, old Herman Munster,
taking off for the parlor.

135
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:03,246
Here I go leaving for work. I
won't even be back till 6:00...

136
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:07,045
so I won't be able to see what
goes on around here all day.

137
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,720
Even if somebody wanted to
steal my wife away...

138
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,020
and alienate my whole family from
me, I wouldn't know about it.

139
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,795
'Cause I'll be down at work.

140
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:22,492
Herman Munster.
What are you shouting about?

141
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:26,526
You'll wake up Chester.
Was I shouting?

[door creaking]

Good morning, all.

Good morning.
Good morning.

145
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,144
Chester, would you like
some breakfast? Fine.

146
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,709
Come sit here, Chester.

147
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,917
[sighing] We have some very tasty
owl's eggs and vulture livers.

148
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,695
That sounds fine,
Mrs. Munster.

149
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,526
Call me Lily.

150
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:58,829
The minute my back is turned, he sits down
at my place, starts calling my wife Lily...

151
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,394
and she starts plying him
with delicacies.

152
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,168
There.

153
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,450
Eddie, as soon as I finish
breakfast, I'll walk you to school.

154
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,577
(Eddie) Hey, that'd be
just boss, Chester.

155
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,780
He can't leave it
at merely stealing my wife...

156
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,789
he's got to
play up to my son.

00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,224
(Lily) Herman Munster... Lily.

158
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,284
Are you spying on me?

159
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,496
Who, me?
Yes, you.

160
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:32,525
You're out here listening because
you're insanely jealous of Chester.

161
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,002
Now, Lily...

162
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,004
[chuckles]

163
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,405
How could you
say such a thing, dear?

164
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,876
You know I never get emotional,
fly off the handle...

165
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,412
or lose my control.

166
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,503
[chuckles]

167
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,845
I'll kill him, I'll kill him,
I'll kill him, I'll kill him.

168
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,943
Herman Munster, you stop
that this instant...

169
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,919
and you go to work.

170
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,161
[deep voice]
Hello, Mrs. Munster.

171
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,027
This is your friendly
national television survey.

172
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,033
We were just wondering if you
were watching Peyton Place.

173
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,401
It isn't on now.
I see.

174
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,773
Are you, by any chance, acting
out your own Peyton Place?

175
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,206
Herman Munster, is that you?

176
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,616
[normal voice] No, it's not me, dear.
It's a total stranger.

177
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,483
Herman, why are you
checking up on me?

178
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,185
[stammering]

179
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,387
[deep voice] This is your friendly
national television survey

180
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,588
signing off.

181
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,531
Friendly
national television survey.

182
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:40,960
[sighs]

183
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,372
Herman, what are we--

184
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,740
What are we sneaking around
outside Chester's door for?

185
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:54,409
He just drove down to the
store on an errand for Lily.

186
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,680
And if he's gonna run off
with my wife...

187
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,552
I want to make sure
he's a man of principles.

188
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,191
[rattling]

189
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,832
Herman, allow me.

190
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,804
[creaking]

191
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,644
Look.

192
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,516
[snickers]

193
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,257
Well, what do you say now?

194
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,597
Herman, it's probably
just a cigarette lighter.

195
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,058
Oh.

196
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,137
I don't think so.

197
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,271
Let's see. What else
have we got here?

198
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,107
TWO cameras, a map.

199
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,982
Grandpa, this smells like big
time syndicate stuff to me.

200
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,993
You know that fellow always had a
definite air of banditry about him.

201
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,263
And to think that
Lily is replacing...

202
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,493
a loyal and faithful husband
with a cheap gangster.

203
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:20,798
Herman, I hate to agree
with you, but this bum...

204
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,475
is on the wrong side
of the law.

205
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:26,932
[thudding]

206
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,083
[scoffs]

207
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,255
Grandpa, this is
more incriminating evidence.

208
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,789
That dirty crook, Chester,
is spying on our neighbors.

209
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,635
(Grandpa) Hey, he got
these things trained...

210
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,970
on Mr. Leonard's house.

211
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,477
Since when did Mr. Leonard
start in the fur business?

212
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,945
Mr. Leonard likes to
change jobs a lot.

213
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,779
He says it keeps him free
from the pressures of society.

214
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:07,840
[scoffs]

215
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,420
Wait a minute. I've got it.

216
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:16,616
That rotten little Chester is
spying on our poor Mr. Leonard...

217
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,889
so he can steal all his furs.

218
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,831
Herman, you are right. That's
why Chester rented this room.

219
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,392
So he could case Mr. Leonard's
house across the street.

220
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,004
(Lily)
Herman Munster.

221
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:37,379
Are you looking at Mrs. Kelly
doing her deep knee bends again?

222
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,848
Nothing of the kind, dear.

223
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,909
And I would suggest
for your safety...

224
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,922
that you, Marilyn,
and Eddie go to the movies.

225
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,146
What?

226
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:50,693
Some irregularities in conduct
have cropped up in your...

227
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,897
gigolo star boarder Chester.
Yeah, the bum's a crook.

228
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:59,494
What are you two talking about?
Lily, dear.

229
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:04,029
There's going to be a showdown between the
forces of virtue and the forces of sin.

230
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,874
<i>Just like in Dick Tracy.</i>

231
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:06,932
[laughs]

232
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,142
Hey, everybody, Spot's
been chasing cars again.

233
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:14,116
And he's eating a little Italian
sports job out in the front yard...

234
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,153
and the guy who was
driving it is really mad.

235
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,485
Eddie, you go down and tell Spot
that if he eats any more cars...

236
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,116
we'll rub his nose
in the transmission.

237
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,287
Eddie, Eddie,
never mind that, son.

238
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,560
I'm counting on you to take the
womenfolk away from the house...

239
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,329
before the showdown. What's
Dad talking about, Mom?

240
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:35,031
Your father and Grandpa
have some silly notion...

241
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,075
that Chester is some kind
of gangster or something.

242
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,007
Precisely right. A gangster.

243
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,477
And that's why you want
to run away with him.

244
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,515
I'm just a plain,
ordinary guy...

245
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:49,815
but he's different,
thrilling, dangerous.

246
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,980
And you want to be
his gun molly.

247
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,889
You are just plain jealous.

248
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,758
Come along, Eddie, Marilyn.
We're going shopping.

249
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:04,426
Herman, I'm sick and tired
of you doubting my love.

250
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,337
Jealousy has turned you into a
suspicious and mistrusting creature.

251
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,908
You're perfectly welcome,
Mr. Leonard.

252
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,645
I was happy to give you
this timely warning.

253
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,786
Hey, that was that
goofball Munster on the phone.

254
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,884
Must have rented his room to a cop
who's been spying on our operation.

255
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:31,893
[scoffs]

256
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,328
Munster thinks he's a crook
trying to get a hold of our furs.

257
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,663
Boys, we gotta start packing up
and get out of here in a hurry.

258
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,225
On the double.

259
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,212
[laughing]

260
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:59,119
Herman, this time
I've outdone myself.

261
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:03,126
I've created the perfect trap here
to nab that dirty crook Chester.

262
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,217
[laughing]

263
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,923
Now, first I show Chester
a card trick.

264
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,230
Very cleverly...

265
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:14,669
I get Chester to select the card
with the cord attached to it.

266
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:18,902
Now, when the cord is pulled,
this activates the blowtorch.

267
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,808
Come on.

268
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,116
It burns through the rope
holding the battle ax...

269
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,953
What battle ax?
That battle ax.

270
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:38,187
Here's where the anvil comes in.
What anvil?

271
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,097
That anvil.

272
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:48,066
I don't think you have all the bugs
worked out of your crook trap yet.

273
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,540
Herman, you ninny, you were
standing in the wrong place.

274
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,507
The anvil hits the couch...

275
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,137
which sends it flying into
the air like a seesaw...

276
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,045
sending Chester flying
through the air...

277
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,947
down the trap door
into the dungeon...

278
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,610
where you are waiting.

279
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,881
Goody. Goody. Goody. Goody.

280
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:09,187
And then once we get him tied up down
there, you know what I'm gonna do?

281
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:12,252
What?
I'm gonna talk mean to him.

282
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:17,224
Herman, will you pipe down.
Now let's reset the trap.

283
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,565
[footsteps approaching] Oh, boy,
this is gonna be real boss.

284
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,038
That's got to be Chester now and we're
gonna catch him in our crook trap.

285
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,598
I wish Lily was here
to see us in action.

286
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,338
Will you cool it? You're
gonna blow the whole setup.

287
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,743
[creaking]

288
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:36,247
Hello, Chester, come right in.
Come right in.

289
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,556
Hello, Grandpa.
Very nice seeing you.

290
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,683
I know you're tired,
you've come home from work...

291
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,058
[laughing]
sit right down here.

292
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,688
I've got a little card trick
I'd like to show you.

293
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,132
I think I've got to get up to my room.
Chester, you can't...

294
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,867
Please. You wouldn't deny
an old man, now, would you?

295
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,929
Go ahead, pick a card.

296
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:02,512
All right, Grandpa, I'll pick a card.
Boy, is he gonna get it.

297
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,551
[whooping]

298
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,058
Bull's-eye, Grandpa.

299
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:23,497
Okay, how does that grab you?
You dirty crook, Chester.

300
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,898
[laughing]

301
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,937
Herman, don't bug Chester.

302
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,734
He's gonna be tied up
down there for a while.

303
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,170
[yelling]

304
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,642
[grunting]

305
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:38,837
[yelling]

306
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,242
Just think of us, Grandpa...

307
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:45,413
[creaking] heroes on the
side of law and justice.

308
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,648
[creaking] Now we call the
police and turn him in.

309
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,093
Maybe, we'll get a reward
and everything.

310
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,826
[phone ringing]

311
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,801
What if it's Lily?

312
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:01,994
Wouldn't it be groovy
to tell her...

313
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,234
that her Prince Charming is
nothing but a rat fink crook?

314
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,879
Hello, Lily?

315
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:16,018
I'm sorry, sir.
I thought you were my wife.

316
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,421
No, I'm sorry. You must
have the wrong number.

317
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,855
I don't know of
any Lt. Skinner.

318
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,154
Skinner?

319
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,386
Skinner?
That name sounds familiar.

320
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,797
Isn't that the last name
of our star boarder?

321
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:34,502
You know, I think you're right.
But Lt. Skinner...

322
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,069
Maybe, he's a Lieutenant
in the Air Force or something.

323
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,338
No, he's not the up-in-the-air type.
Well?

324
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,812
Could he be a lieutenant
in the Salvation Army?

325
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,406
Lieutenant Governor?
Don't be silly.

326
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:51,081
The only other kind of lieutenants are...
Police lieutenants.

327
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,889
Police lieutenants.
Police lieutenants.

328
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,958
You know something, Grandpa?

329
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,521
If you were a cowboy...

330
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,962
I'd say you just said
a very discouraging word.

331
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,605
Oh.

332
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,649
Hi, dear.

333
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,650
[laughs]

334
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:25,746
Herman, what's going on? You
have a funny look in your eye.

335
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,058
Well, dear...

336
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:31,526
Grandpa and I have something to tell you.
What is it?

337
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:33,792
Tell her, Grandpa.

338
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,823
Not for a million dollars.
Uncle Herman, what is it?

339
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,731
We have a cop tied up
in the dungeon.

340
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:46,907
What cop?
Our star boarder, Chester.

341
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,501
Oh, no.

342
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,710
What are we going to
do about it, Lily?

343
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,011
I don't know
what you're going to do...

344
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:57,485
but I'm going down
and untie that poor man.

345
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:03,390
And then I'm going to try to explain to
him that you are nothing but a dumb...

346
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:07,624
stupid, foolish, knot-headed nitwit.
Yes, dear.

347
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:11,030
Oh, oh, oh, dear, if you have
any trouble convincing him...

348
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,227
I'll come right down
and help you.

349
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,291
No!

350
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:27,648
One lump or two?
One, please.

351
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,377
[sighs]

352
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:36,458
You see, my husband had no idea
that you were a police officer.

353
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:39,257
I do hope you'll forgive him.
Well, I'd like to.

354
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,820
But, after all, he did let that
fellow, Leonard, get away.

355
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,424
And he and his gang are some of the
biggest fences in the country.

356
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:45,559
[tut-tutting]

357
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,363
<i>Y oo-hoo!</i>

358
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,875
We're home.

359
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,716
(Lily) Herman, what
have you done now?

360
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,219
We've captured
the fur thieves.

361
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,756
That's Leonard and one of his boys.
How did you do it?

362
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,689
Just used the old noodle.

363
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:11,589
You see, the other day
our pet Spot...

364
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,228
stole the bumper
of Mr. Leonard's car.

365
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,321
[chuckles]

366
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,867
I just let him sniff it
and told him to go fetch...

367
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:21,700
and good old Spot nailed their car
before it got halfway down the block.

368
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,932
That's great. It's too bad you
couldn't nab the other two, though.

369
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:29,843
I think you'll find that Spot's
detaining them right outside.

370
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:31,944
Take a look out here.

371
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,307
[door creaking]

372
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,615
[Spot screeching]

373
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,248
(Lily)
Good boy, Spot.

374
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,925
<i>As they say on Perry Mason...</i>

375
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:52,161
I guess that wraps up
another case.
