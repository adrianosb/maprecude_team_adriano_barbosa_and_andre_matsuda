Eddie's flunked science.

What?
I can't believe it.

5
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,759
Eddie's
always had it up here.

6
00:00:21,835 --> 00:00:24,804
Well, it's about time
we gave it to him down here.

7
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:28,500
I was just in his room, and I found
these letters from his school principal,
Mr. Balding.

8
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:31,840
Three of them!
Obviously, he's been hiding them.

00:00:31,912 --> 00:00:34,073
I can't understand it.

10
00:00:34,147 --> 00:00:38,083
We've never given him
any reason to be afraid of us.
That's true, Lily.

11
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:41,712
I tell ya. I'm very concerned.

12
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:45,383
I haven't been so shocked since
the last time I sat in Grandpa's chair.

What are we gonna do?

14
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:50,760
Well, I think we'll have to go
right down to that school
and find out what's going on.

15
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:54,790
There's nothing better
at a time like this
than meeting face-to-face.

16
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:10,707
Oh, Taggert,
don't you think you're being
a trifle too harsh on the boy?

17
00:02:10,777 --> 00:02:13,473
In my professional opinion,
Eddie Munster should be expelled.

18
00:02:13,547 --> 00:02:15,674
I think you're going too far,
Taggert.

19

After all, this is a grammar school.
You're not a prison guard anymore.

20
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,881
If you'd use a few more
of my methods, you'd have less trouble
with some of your inmates.

I mean, pupils.

22

Look, Taggert. I don't care
if your brother-in-law is a member
of the Board of Education.

I am running this school,
not you!

24

Now, there could be
a perfectly good reason why the Munsters
haven't answered my letters.

Hmph. That's exactly
what Dillinger's principal said.

All right. What do you suggest
we should do about it?

You leave it to me.

28
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,679
I'm going out to their house
and throw a good scare
into those Munsters.

29
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:56,120
Eddie, why didn't you show us
these notes from your teacher?

30
00:02:56,189 --> 00:02:59,750
I guess I didn't want you
to know I was failing science, sir.

31

Don't you want to follow
in your father's tracks?

have to suspend some of your privileges.

no more sleeping in Spot's cage,

you're gonna have to go to bed
while it's still dark.

Why, you're-you're positively inhuman.

ready for the science fair.

Well, you see, it's...

right away on that project,

nowadays to have a sense of humor.

down at the parlor.

you'd better get going.
You'll be late again.

where is Eddie anyway?

my marks up when I enter it
in the science fair at school.

we're not reliable.

a second chance.

149
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:26,435
Well, any boy interested enough
in science to build a robot deserves
a second chance.

150
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:29,066
Thanks again, Mr. Balding.

151
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:35,038
Oh, uh, the youngsters
are bringing their projects
to the science fair tonight.

152
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:37,241
Be sure
Eddie has his robot there.

153
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:39,808
My family and I
will see you then.
Good.

154
00:10:39,886 --> 00:10:43,151
I'll be looking forward
to seeing them... face-to-face.

155
00:10:43,222 --> 00:10:45,281
[Mouths Words]

156
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:56,027
Good grief, Taggert!

157
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:58,570
Don't tell me you've
become a beatnik at your age.

158
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:01,835
I have just come
from the Munsters' house,

159
00:11:01,908 --> 00:11:04,172
and I was lucky
to escape with my life.

160
00:11:04,243 --> 00:11:07,735
Any boy who comes from
that background has got to be
a delinquent.

161
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:10,408
You should see the boy's grandfather.

162
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:12,417
He looks like a fatJack the Ripper!

163
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:17,615
Taggert,
this is not a reform school.

164
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,352
We can't expel
every student you don't like.

165
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:22,360
There wouldn't be anyone here
but the janitor.

166
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:24,919
Eddie Munster is really different.

167
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:27,831
Oh, nonsense.
His cousin was right here in my office,

168
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,266
and she's a charming, lovely person.

169
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:33,032
And she convinced me
to give the boy a second chance.

170
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:35,438
[Chuckling]

171

[Laughing]

172
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:47,018
Say, "Ah."
[Chuckling Continues]

173
00:11:47,086 --> 00:11:51,079
Come on! Say, "Ah."
Ahhh.

174
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:54,957
Oh! I'm sorry, Grandpa.
I didn't know you had company.

175
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:58,794
E-Excuse me.
That's not company.
That's Eddie's robot!

176
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:04,727
[Arm Clicks]
How do you do?

177
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:07,568
That's amazing.

178
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,336
If the top of his head was a little flatter,
he'd look positively human.

179
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,378
[Chuckles]

180
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:26,018
I've seen that robot.
It's not only a piece of junk,
it's a menace to society.

181
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:29,721
It's got a flat head.
Now, that is a sure sign
of a criminal type.

182
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:32,931
I'll see it for myself tonight.

183
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:36,301
And, Taggert,

184
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:39,099
if you're lying,
it's your job.

185
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,601
You're forgetting
my brother-in-law's a member
of the Board of Education.

186
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:49,340
I don't care if your father's the governor.

187
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:05,530
The only job security I have left
is to make sure that robot don't work.

188
00:13:05,598 --> 00:13:09,159
Sometimes I wish I'd stayed a prison guard.
You meet a better class of people.

189
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:25,609
Oh, dear, they've already started.
I knew we'd be late.

190
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:29,951
Herman, if you hadn't spent
so much time reading that joke book,
we could've been here an hour ago.

191
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:33,253
Sorry, dear. But you know
how hard it is to put a book down
in the middle of a joke.

192
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:39,227
Herman,
we'll take the robot backstage.
You go and park the car.

193
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,303
[Tires Squealing]

194
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:56,939
Aha! So we meet again!
Sic 'im!
Oh, no. Wait a minute!

195
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:59,007
L-I want to apologize.
[Rattling]

196
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:02,816
- I was a bit hasty today.
- That's different.

197
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:07,485
After seeing the robot,
I realized that Eddie must come from
a very unusual family.

198
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,858
Thank you.
[Chuckles]

199
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:13,797
Yes, this is, uh,
certainly a very handsome,

200
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:15,800
uh, piece of work.

201
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:24,204
Uh, Mr. Taggert,
are you attending the science fair?

202
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:26,302
No, I want to go over
Eddie's records.

203
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:30,315
I want to make sure he gets,
uh, exactly what's coming to him.
Thank you.

204
00:14:32,585 --> 00:14:35,748
Start her up, Eddie.
Let's give it a trial run.

205
00:14:35,821 --> 00:14:37,880
[Bangs, Grinds]

206

[Whistling]

207
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:46,689
What happened?
That's the first time I've ever seen
a robot with indigestion.

208
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:52,802
?? [Piano]

209
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,539
That was little Andrea Sue Blum,

210
00:14:56,609 --> 00:14:59,100
Class Two, B-4, reading her composition,

211
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:02,670
"What Einstein's Theory
of Relativity Means to Me."

212
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,779
Something wrong?
It's the robot, Uncle Herman.
It's not working.

213
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:11,812
- Eddie, try it again.
- [Robot Grinds, Bangs, Whistles]

214
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,322
I think it's the carburetor.

215
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:20,888
The only answer
is an emergency
carburetorectomy.

216
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:23,561
Help me get this
into the dressing room.

217
00:15:25,638 --> 00:15:29,472
Next is MasterJules Daly,
Class Four, A-3,

Grandpa, you think
you'll be finished on time?

221
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:50,220
They'll be calling for Eddie soon.

222
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:52,924
- Why don't you just take the robot...
- Herman, please.

223
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:55,365
I didn't interfere when you
were being put together.

tonight will be a robot...

built by young Eddie Munster.!

Oh, Grandpa!
They're introducing the robot
right now.

What'll we do?
Lily, please! I mean,
these things take time.

240
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:05,203
After all,
I'm only flesh and blood.

241
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:08,934
Somebody will just have to go out
there and stall them until we're ready,

242
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:11,636
like they do in those old
Don Ameche movies on TV.

[Aunt Lily]
But who?
Is it over yet?

244
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:25,453
L... I have no idea
what's holding things up, but...

245
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:28,118
I'm sure he'll be right out.

246

The robot, please!

247
00:17:30,863 --> 00:17:32,797
Stall them?
Yes!

248
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:34,992
How?
Just talk to them.

249
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:37,695
Talk to them?
Oh, I couldn't.
I'd-I'd be scared to death.

250
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,228
I'd-I'd get stage fright.
What could I say?

251
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:44,936
Why don't you tell them some
of those jokes you've been reading
in that book?

252
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,741
- That ought to keep them amused.
- Now, Herman, this could be your big break.

253
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:51,009
Go out there and give them
everything you've got!

254
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,415
Why, just think, Herman.
This could mean Hollywood...

255
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:56,182
The Palace!

256
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:59,418
- Come on, dear.
- All right.

257
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:01,790
[Rhythmic Clapping]
I'll go out there.

258
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:04,955
But I'm not doing this
for fame or fortune...
[Clapping Continues]

259
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,964
Or to be the life of the party.

I'm doing this for Eddie.

Uh... Uh, ladies and gentlemen.

Um, uh-uh,
this is my first public appearance.

276
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:09,427
So, you'll have to...

00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:12,555
bear with me if I don't
function too well.

278
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:18,659
As a matter of fact,
this situation reminds me of a story.

279
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:21,297
One time,
Abraham Lincoln was asked...

280
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:25,241
if he found appearing
at public ceremonies annoying.

281
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,871
He said, "Yes.

"In fact, I feel like the man
who was ridden out of town on a rail...

who said, "If it wasn't for the honor
of the thing, I'd rather walk."'

has thrown a wrench in the works.

00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:52,529
Ca-Can we bring it out now?
Of course!

302
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:55,999
All we have to do
is get Herman off the stage.

303
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:58,764
Come on.
Careful, Grandpa.

304
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:02,534
Feet.
Careful.

[Cheers, Applause Continue]

309
00:21:19,992 --> 00:21:22,586
That was great work, Herman.
But you can stop now.

310
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:25,186
- The robot's fixed.
- Stop now? Are you kidding?

311
00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:27,562
You hear 'em out there?
I'm a smash.

312
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:33,027
I tell you. They're my kind of people.
They love me out there. I got 'em right
in the palm of my hand.

313
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:36,871
Herman Munster.!
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself!

314
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:41,538
Aren't you forgetting something?
This is supposed to be Eddie's night,
not yours.

315
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:46,677
But, Lily, l...
[Crowd Shouting For More]

316
00:21:46,752 --> 00:21:49,118
Lily, I guess you're right.

317
00:21:49,188 --> 00:21:51,179
I'm just a big ham.

318
00:21:51,256 --> 00:21:54,316
It was the lights and the applause.
L...

319
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:56,725
I just got carried away.

320
00:21:56,795 --> 00:22:00,458
Eddie, do you hear that out there?
More.! More.! More.!

321
00:22:00,532 --> 00:22:02,466
That's for you.

322
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:06,061
Now, take your robot
and go on out there and kill 'em!

323
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:10,734
- Herman!
- Lily, that's just
a show business expression.

324
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:14,768
Okay, Eddie.
Start her up now.

[Bell Clanging]

326
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,752
I'm sorry, Eddie.
I've let you down.
It's all my fault.

327
00:22:29,828 --> 00:22:33,764
What am I going to do?
There's nothing to do.

328
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:37,791
I'll...
just go out and explain.

329
00:22:40,806 --> 00:22:44,139
No, Dad, that's my job.

330

[Sighs]

331
00:22:54,453 --> 00:22:56,580
No!

332
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:02,057
Eddie just informed me
his robot exploded backstage.

[Disappointed Groans]

334
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:07,456
However-However,
I think I speak for everyone here
when I say...

335
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:10,525
the special prize
should still go to Eddie Munster.

336
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:13,127
Yeah!

337
00:23:13,205 --> 00:23:16,299
[Indistinct]
Really?

338
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:20,310
Eddie tells me
he doesn't deserve to win.

339
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:23,109
He was helped
by his grandfather.

340
00:23:23,182 --> 00:23:26,913
You know, I think
such honesty should be rewarded.

341
00:23:26,985 --> 00:23:31,649
Eddie, my young friend,
you're the kind of a boy
we're proud to have in our school.

342
00:23:31,724 --> 00:23:33,749
[Man]
I agree.!

343
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:40,289
[Applause Continues]
I think our Eddie
has just become a man!

344
00:23:40,365 --> 00:23:43,801
And the hard way,
not like you, Herman.

345
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:46,531
That's our boy.
[Chuckles]

346
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,313
Where's Eddie?
And where's my joke book?

347
00:23:57,382 --> 00:24:00,112
I haven't seen it.
And Eddie's down in the lab.

348
00:24:00,185 --> 00:24:02,380
He and Grandpa
are working on a new project.

349
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:05,685
Another invention?
It's got something to do
with the robot.

350
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:09,319
Hmph.
It's remarkable how that boy's
marks have improved.

351
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:12,454
He's liable to turn out just like me
if he keeps his head to the grindstone.

352
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:15,523
I'm so glad to hear they sent
that awful Mr. Taggert back
to prison service.

353
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:19,128
It's men like him
who give prisons a bad name.

"Why does a chicken
cross the road?"

355
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,669
[Robotic Monotone]
To get on the other side.

356
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:28,269
[Laughing]
That was good, Eddie.
Good.

357
00:24:28,347 --> 00:24:32,647
Try another one.
"Why do firemen
wear red suspenders?"

358
00:24:32,718 --> 00:24:35,915
To keep their pants up.

359
00:24:35,988 --> 00:24:38,149
Eddie, we'll make a fortune.

360
00:24:38,223 --> 00:24:42,091
They say vaudeville is dead,
but you and I, we're gonna
bring it back to life.

361
00:24:43,295 --> 00:24:45,729
Yuk, yuk, yuk.
