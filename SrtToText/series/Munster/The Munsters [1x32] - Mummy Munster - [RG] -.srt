1
00:00:05,018 --> 00:00:07,009
There you are, Herman!
Oh.

2
00:00:07,087 --> 00:00:11,751
Who were you calling?
Oh, I was just trying to make
an appointment at that new barbershop.

3
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:13,850
Well, what's wrong
with your old barber?

4
00:00:13,927 --> 00:00:17,090
Oh, Lily. He-He always made me
very nervous, dear,

5
00:00:17,164 --> 00:00:21,123
the way he'd always blindfold himself
before he'd give me a shave.

6
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:24,364
Some of those temperamental
hairdressers are such show-offs.

7
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:27,271
Oh, by the way,
Marilyn has a project to do...

8
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:29,275
for her course
in ancient history.

9
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:31,573
I'm going to drive her down
to the county museum tonight.

10
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:34,170
Oh, uh...
Oh, no, you're not, dear.

11
00:00:34,247 --> 00:00:37,273
I am the head of this house,
and as such,

12
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:39,842
I will take care of this matter.

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,686
All right. But, uh,
just drive her there
and then pick her up later.

14
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:46,624
I don't want you getting
in any trouble.

15
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:50,493
Lily, how could I get
in any trouble at a museum?

16
00:00:56,703 --> 00:01:00,935
Thatcher, this may turn out to be
one of the greatest discoveries
in Egyptology...

17
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:04,670
a perfectly preserved sarcophagus
from the 18th Dynasty.

18
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:07,441
And you have reason to believe
that it's never been opened?

19
00:01:07,514 --> 00:01:11,746
No evidence of grave robbers,
and the tomb it came from appeared
to be completely undisturbed.

20
00:01:11,818 --> 00:01:15,879
And you actually have hope
that-that it may be occupied?

21
00:01:15,956 --> 00:01:18,447
Well, we can't say
one way or the other.

22
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:20,789
But if it is, this may be...

23
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:23,830
the most perfectly preserved mummy
since King Tut.

24
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:26,422
When we open this lid
at the press conference
tomorrow morning,

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,799
we may be face-to-face
with one of the most
incredible and startling sights...

26
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,861
ever seen by modern man.

27
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:40,364
[Lily]
Eddie, what happened to you?

28
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,206
Oh, I was taking Spot for a walk,
and he chased a car again.

29
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:48,714
Oh, my. Did he catch it?
No. He just ate
the rear bumper off.

30
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:52,980
Oh, dear. He's so playful.
He'll be hiccuping all night.

31
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:56,318
Say, where's Dad?
He took Marilyn
to the museum,

32
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:58,380
and now he's down
with Grandpa in the lab...

33
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,517
working on an experiment.

34
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:02,789
Is it anyone we know?
No, dear.

35
00:03:02,863 --> 00:03:06,196
Grandpa's trying to invent
some new kind of sleeping pill.

36
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:08,200
There you are, Herman.

37
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:11,169
If this pill doesn't
put you to sleep,
I don't know what will.

38
00:03:11,238 --> 00:03:14,867
[Chuckles]
Uh... But, Grandpa, I can't take
a sleeping pill now.

39
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:17,774
I've got to go down
and pick up Marilyn
at the museum.

40
00:03:17,844 --> 00:03:20,870
And you know I hate to drive
when I'm asleep.

41
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:25,612
But, Herman, this is not
an ordinary sleeping pill.

42
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:27,880
This is an alarm clock pill.

43
00:03:27,954 --> 00:03:30,115
An alarm clock pill?

44
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,159
Yes. I can set it
to put you to sleep...

45
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:36,627
and wake you up
at any time you want.

46
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:39,995
Now, uh, it'll only take you
a few minutes to pick up Marilyn.

47
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:42,159
I'll set it to put you
to sleep in an hour.

48
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:46,963
- There.
- Oh, fine!

49
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,498
I'm not working tomorrow,
so I can sleep late.

50
00:03:50,577 --> 00:03:52,568
Things are a little slack
at the parlor.

51
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:56,173
For the past few days,
everything's been going out
with nothing coming in.

52
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:58,683
In that case,
[Chuckles]

53
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:00,913
You can sleep through the night.

54
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:05,117
I'll set it for 24 hours.
It'll wake you up at, uh,

55
00:04:05,191 --> 00:04:07,489
10:00 p.m. Tomorrow night.

56
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:09,495
Oh, fine!

57
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:12,828
Uh, but, Grandpa.
Is it all right to take one of these
on an empty stomach?

58
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:14,423
Sure!

59
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:21,797
[Gulps]

60
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,104
[Crash]

61
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:27,578
Well, that really was empty.

62
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,914
Hello, Aunt Lily, Grandpa.
What happened to Uncle Herman?

63
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:39,982
What happened to him?

64
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,223
Well, he went down
to the museum
to pick you up.

65
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:47,596
Well, I waited for him,
but I didn't see him anyplace,
so I took a taxi home.

66
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:49,965
Oh! That Herman!

67
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:53,005
I shouldn't ever let him
go anywhere alone!

68
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:55,769
Sometimes he gets so flaky.

69
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:57,969
Marilyn?
[Echoing]
Marilyn?

70
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:03,481
Marilyn?
[Echoing]

71
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,643
Marilyn?
[Echoing]

72
00:05:06,886 --> 00:05:09,377
Marilyn?
[Echoing]

73
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:11,947
Marilyn, Marilyn?
[Echoing]

74
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:15,188
Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn?
[Echoing]

75
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:18,526
? Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn
Life is but a dream?
[Echoing]

76
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:24,828
Oh, stop it, Herman.
You're not here to have fun.

77
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:28,032
Oh, I guess she's gone.
I must have missed her. Mmm!

78
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:30,099
[Sighs]

79
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:41,210
Hmm. Locked.

80
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:47,917
Darn!

81
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:50,986
Well, I'll just have to
rip it off its hinges.

82
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:57,095
No. Better not.

83
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,231
It does not behoove
a good citizen to desecrate
cultural landmarks.

84
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:04,799
I'll just telephone
the proper authorities
and have them let me out.

85
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:07,438
Must be a telephone booth
around here somewhere.

86
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:13,718
Oh! Hi, there!

87
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:17,621
Uh, we have a little fella
just like you at home.

88
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:21,550
[Kissing Noises]

89
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:31,229
Oh. There are the phone booths.

90
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:33,295
[Chuckling]

91
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,642
Hmm.

92
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,701
Fancy ones.

93
00:06:45,318 --> 00:06:48,845
Oh! Uh, oh, excuse me, sir.
I didn't know this phone
was taken.

94
00:06:48,922 --> 00:06:51,220
Uh, I'll use
the one over there.

95
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,225
Uh, sorry.

96
00:07:09,142 --> 00:07:11,838
Huh. Door seems to be stuck.

97
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:16,272
[Creaking]

98
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:23,347
Hmm. No one in here.

99
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:31,124
You'd think they could put
a light in these things.

100
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:34,724
Just hope I can get this call through
before Grandpa's pill hits me.

101
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:38,100
Uh, let's see.
Where's the phone?

102
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,870
Say, there. Uh, say there.

103
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:45,103
Uh, listen.
Someone closed the door.

104
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:48,306
Uh, who closed the door?

105
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:51,282
[Muttering]

106
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:59,748
Say, is there anyone out there?
Uh, say, listen.
Someone let me out.!

107
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:04,188
Let me out.! Let me out.!

108
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,959
In other words, Dr. Wilkerson,
you expect to find...

109
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:12,129
a fully preserved mummy
when you open this sarcophagus.

110
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:14,935
That is our hope,
gentlemen... and lady.

111
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:17,806
From the carvings
and hieroglyphics
on the case,

112
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:20,641
we believe this to be
from the tomb of Ahmenhotep IV.

113
00:08:20,713 --> 00:08:23,876
We're quite disturbed
by the fact that last night...

114
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,918
we left the sarcophagus upright,

115
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:28,180
and this morning we found it
here on its back.

116
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:31,348
Yes. We're not saying that
anyone tried to steal it,

117
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:35,793
but we do know that a find
such as this would be quite valuable
to any rival museum.

118
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:38,695
Do you have any worries
about a curse on this mummy case,

119
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:41,529
like there was on, uh,
King Tut's tomb?

120
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:43,796
No, we're men of science.

121
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,863
Whatever we find in here
you can be quite sure
will not frighten us.

122
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:49,932
Thatcher?

123
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:05,056
Doctor, it's amazing!

124
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:07,615
He almost looks
as though he's sleeping!

125
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:11,787
It's the most skillful job
of embalming I've ever seen.

126
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:15,824
It's a great tribute
to their ancient art.

127
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:20,168
Observe... only slight traces
of deterioration around the edges.

128
00:09:21,507 --> 00:09:24,806
I'm sorry. We've got to close the lid
of the sarcophagus immediately.

129
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:29,315
We have no idea what effect
the air may have
on this ancient mummy.

130
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:31,373
Careful, Thatcher.

131
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:42,323
We'll open it again
after we've gathered together...

132
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:45,523
some of the top Egyptologists
from all over the world.

133
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:48,795
Do you plan to ship this
to one of the large museums
in the East?

134
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:51,564
Not at all.
This is our discovery.

135
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:54,766
Matter of fact, I don't mind telling you
that the contents of this sarcophagus...

136
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:57,139
will leave this room
over my dead body.

137
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:05,176
It's no use.
I can't eat my supper.

138
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:07,185
I'm so worried about Herman!

139
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:09,187
Aunt Lily, wherever he is,

140
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:12,190
when Uncle Herman wakes up,
he'll come home.

141
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:15,386
'Course he will!
I'm sure he's still asleep,

142
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:18,055
'cause every time I try
to tune him in
on my crystal ball,

143
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:20,395
all I get is a herringbone pattern.

144
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:23,401
He probably holed up someplace
and fell asleep.

145
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:27,667
Are you sure that silly
sleeping pill of yours will
wake him up at 10:00 tonight?

146
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,005
Sure, I'm sure. I'd bet
one of my lives on it.

147
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:35,178
Mom! Marilyn! Grandpa!

148
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:38,046
I found Pop!
You found Herman?
Where is he?

149
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:41,245
Right in the front page
of this evening's newspaper.

150
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:44,051
[Grandpa]
"Local museum makes astounding find.

151
00:10:44,123 --> 00:10:46,557
"Ancient mummy discovered.

goofed it again!

Well, I thought you'd better
see this one, Doctor.

There she is.

What is it?
I don't know, sir.

But I think we ought to be,
uh, very nice to her.

It could be another one of those

How do you do?
I was just admiring
your museum.

You have such lovely
dead things on exhibit.

Thank you. Now, how
can we help you, madam.

174
00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:07,999
Well, I came about this article
and picture in the newspaper.
You see, he's mine.

175
00:12:08,074 --> 00:12:10,440
You mean, he's your mummy?

176
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,478
Oh, no. No.
He's my husband.

177
00:12:13,913 --> 00:12:16,473
Now, if you'll show me where he is,
I would like to talk to him.

"Talk to him"? I'm afraid
that's not too practical, madam.

You see, this man is
3,000 years old.

He is no such thing!

that he's not a day over 150.

I'd marry an old man?

00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:38,327
Now, will you please
take me to my husband.

184
00:12:38,404 --> 00:12:40,895
Uh, will you excuse us
for a moment?

185
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:47,307
What... What do you think
we should do, Doctor?

186
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,541
Well, she seems quite disturbed,

187
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:51,845
and we don't want her
to make a scene.

188

Perhaps if we show her the mummy,
she'll stop insisting it's her husband.

that looks like that.

he's going to wake up.

You know, you're right.

to wake up till 10:00.

Oh, dear. I really must
do my shopping.

A f... A favor?
Yes. Here's two dollars.

206
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:03,655
Now, when he wakes up,
would you put him in a cab
and send him home?

207
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:06,453
- Put him in a cab?
- Yes. He knows the address.

208
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:09,222
It's 1313 Mockingbird Lane.

Oh, and by the way,
ask Herman to give the driver
a fifty-cent tip.

Good-bye, now.

Oh, and you two have been
just a couple of sweethearts.

What do you think, Thatcher?

213
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:38,347
Well, sir, when the...
when the visitors start looking
weirder than the exhibits,

214
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:42,087
I think it's time to get out
of the museum business.
Nonsense.

215
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:45,460
I think she's some kind of a plant
to size up our layout.

216
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:48,523
This morning, we found
the sarcophagus on its side,

217
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:52,833
and now she uses that
ridiculous story to come in here
and get a look at our mummy.

someone is definitely trying...

We can't afford
to take any chances.

We'll post a 24-hour guard,

to stay here all night...

off that sarcophagus.

00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:18,757
We'll just have your Uncle Herman
tell this man to his face...

301
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:22,487
that he is not Ahmenhotep IV.

302
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:24,495
I'm his wife.

303
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:27,327
I certainly should know
whether he was dead or not.

304
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:39,135
Now, he's down here.
You can go down
and talk to him yourself.

305
00:21:39,211 --> 00:21:42,374
I have lunch to get.
Come on, Marilyn.

306
00:21:56,929 --> 00:21:59,227
Boy, what a weird setup!

307
00:21:59,298 --> 00:22:02,358
Listen, anybody
who'd steal mummies
has to be a little weird.

308
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:04,595
There's nobody down here.

309
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:08,901
Wait a minute.
There's something there
on this table.

310
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:16,537
This is it.
This is what we're after.

311
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:20,577
Shall we, uh, arrest
those people upstairs?

312
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:24,248
No, we'll uh... We'll get it back
to the museum first.
We'll prosecute later.

313
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:28,157
Yeah, well,
let's get out of here.
This place gives me the creeps.

314
00:22:28,227 --> 00:22:30,161
[Grunting]

315
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:32,663
Boy. I was on the drunk detail
for four years.

316
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:35,325
I never saw anybody
as stiff as this.

317
00:22:38,504 --> 00:22:41,166
Lily! Lily!

318
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,004
Lily!
What is it, Grandpa?
What is it?

319
00:22:44,076 --> 00:22:46,544
What is it? I looked out
the upstairs window,

320
00:22:46,612 --> 00:22:49,877
and some man put Herman
in a station wagon
and took him away!

321
00:22:49,948 --> 00:22:52,007
Took him away?
But why?

322
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:54,416
They just went down
to the dungeon
to talk to him.

323
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:57,478
They couldn't have talked to him.
I gave him another one
of my sleeping pills,

324
00:22:57,556 --> 00:22:59,490
and he was sound asleep!

325
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:03,551
Oh, Grandpa!
Why can't you experiment
on white mice...

326
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:06,393
like any other normal
mad scientist?

327
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:10,765
Now I suppose Herman will take
another 24-hour catnap
in that sarcophagus.

328
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:15,205
No, Lily. This sleeping pill
was set for only a half an hour.

329
00:23:15,274 --> 00:23:19,370
Oh! What... What do you think
will happen now?

330
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:21,504
I don't know, Lily.

331
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,572
But when Herman wakes up
in the back of that station wagon,

332
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,245
those men better have
a box of candy with them.

333
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:44,491
Boy, this is the wildest assignment
I've ever been on.

334
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,336
But it was worth it to me.
The unearthing of Ahmenhotep IV...

335
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:51,205
will put me on every
front page in the country.

336
00:23:51,276 --> 00:23:53,642
Has this guy really been
in the ground 3,000 years?

337
00:23:53,712 --> 00:23:56,943
Yes. Perhaps longer.
I'll tell you one thing.

338
00:23:57,015 --> 00:23:59,449
He looks better
than my mother-in-law
does right now.

339
00:24:00,452 --> 00:24:02,647
[Herman Guffawing]

340
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,889
You know,
there's only three of us here.

341
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,690
I could've sworn I heard
four of us laughing.

342
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:14,555
Uh, you know,
that's a good one.

343
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:17,727
Uh, listen. Speaking
of mother-in-law jokes,
did you ever hear...

344
00:24:17,803 --> 00:24:20,772
[Men Shouting]

345
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:23,831
[Tires Screeching]

346
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:26,537
- Oh!
- Clear out! Clear out!

347
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:28,546
[Crash]

348
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,554
Uh, taxi?

349
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,621
Taxi?
