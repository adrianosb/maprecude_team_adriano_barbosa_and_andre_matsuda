1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,281
Good morning.
Good morning, Eddie.

2
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:15,457
Eddie, I'm very upset
with you this morning.

3
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:18,692
I told you to keep Spot's water dish
filled out in the yard.

4
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:21,529
Last night he got thirsty,
and he went down the street...

5
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:24,661
and drained
Mr. And Mrs. Hazlett's pool.

6
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:28,139
- I'm sorry. I forgot.
- Well, Mrs. Hazlett just phoned.

7
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:31,041
She was very embarrassed
when her husband went out
to take his morning dip...

8
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:33,170
and dove into an empty pool.

9
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:36,348
What kind of
a neighborhood is this...

10
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:40,477
where people begrudge a poor,
dumb animal a drink of water?

11
00:00:40,554 --> 00:00:43,148
[Chuckling]
Good morning, everybody.
Good morning.

12
00:00:43,223 --> 00:00:45,316
Morning, dear.
[Chuckles]

13
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:47,656
What are your plans
for the weekend, dear?

14
00:00:47,728 --> 00:00:50,322
I just thought I'd
stick around the house.

15
00:00:50,397 --> 00:00:53,161
As a matter of fact, I thought
I might work on the car.

16
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:55,667
It needs a thorough checkup.

17
00:00:55,736 --> 00:00:58,398
Herman, please, take it
to the service station.

18
00:00:58,472 --> 00:01:01,635
You're not very mechanical.
You're all thumbs.

19
00:01:02,943 --> 00:01:04,934
No, I'm not. Hmph.

20
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:09,505
What, do you think I was put
together by some kind of nut?
Well, please be careful.

21
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:12,814
Every time you plan a weekend
project, you get in trouble.

22
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:15,582
Lily, please.
Don't be silly, dear.

23
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:18,590
How could a clear-thinking,
intelligent person such as I...

24
00:01:18,658 --> 00:01:21,218
get in any kind of trouble?
[Laughing]

25
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:28,124
Hmm?
If you'll get up out of
the oatmeal, I'll tell you.

26
00:01:38,145 --> 00:01:42,639
Alfred, that looks like the perfect spot
to stage our next accident...

27
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:46,208
the intersection of
Mockingbird Lane and Maple Drive.

28
00:01:46,286 --> 00:01:49,346
Yeah, it's a nice, quiet
residential neighborhood.

29
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:53,792
But where are we gonna get a victim,
now that Double-jointed Benny's
been picked up by the cops?

30
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,296
Alfred, I gotta admit that
with that scarred face of his...

31
00:01:57,364 --> 00:02:00,856
and his knack for being able
to throw his bones out of joint,

32
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:03,835
the insurance companies did
pay off without a second look.

33
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,670
Now, don't worry.
We'll find somebody to take his place.

34
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:11,006
But where?
This is a big city, Alfred.

35
00:02:11,077 --> 00:02:14,012
Somewhere there must be
some big, stupid guy...

36
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,642
with a face that looks like it's been
in an accident before it happens.

37
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:27,847
What's new in the paper, Grandpa?
Oh, nothing much.

38
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:32,017
The New York Museum is sending
some archaeologist to Transylvania.

39
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:35,459
Hmm. Well, I hope they
don't dig up anyone we know.

40
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,464
Say, listen to this.

41
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:42,298
"Police Seek Accident Ring."
Oh, what's that about?

42
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:45,202
Well, they're after
a bunch of crooks...

43
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:49,231
who stage phony accidents
to gyp the insurance companies.

44
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:52,403
Phony accidents.
Yes. Isn't that terrible?

45
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,312
Everything is so synthetic these days.

46
00:03:57,484 --> 00:04:00,248
[Wind Whistling]

47
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:07,957
Well, I checked the oil
and the transmission.

48
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:10,622
Now all I have to check
is the differential.

49
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:14,098
Are you gonna
jack up the rear end?
Exactly what I'm gonna do.

50
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:32,581
[Grunting]

51
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:52,297
[Laughing]

52
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:06,518
I'll go get the wrench, Pop.

53
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:11,523
The corner of Mockingbird Lane
and Maple Drive oughta be
around here somewhere.

54
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:16,255
But,J.R., what's the sense of
sizing it up for an accident
when we don't even have a victim?

55
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:19,423
First, we gotta get the lay
of the land, then the victim.

56
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:23,094
Look,J.R. There's some
character working under
that wild-lookin' hot rod.

57
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:25,933
Maybe he could tell us
where Maple Drive is.

58
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:32,409
Uh, say, buddy?

59
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:43,849
Uh, yes. Can I help you?

60
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:46,187
Uh, excuse me.

61
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:51,555
Did you ever see such a face?

62
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:55,563
That's a face?

63
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:58,297
It must be.
He's talking out of it.

64
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:01,135
That's the first time I ever saw
a ready-made victim.

65
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:05,166
Uh, tell me something, sir.

66
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:08,510
How would you like to get in
on a great moneymaking career?

67
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:10,913
Oh, I'm sorry, gentlemen,
but, you see,

68
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:14,181
I've already taken a course
in hotel management.

69
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:17,018
[Laughing]
No, it's nothing like that.

70
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,924
I'm J.R. Finlater, and this is
my associate, Alfred Swanson.

71
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:23,656
And have we got a deal for you.

72
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,694
Herman, you're
going to be a what?

73
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:31,703
You heard me, Lily.

74
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:35,502
I'm gonna be an actor and a star
in a million-dollar epic.

75
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:39,840
Herman, two men from Hollywood
happened to come along...

76
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:43,542
and discover you while you
were working on your differential?

77
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:47,108
Well, they said Lana Turner
was discovered exactly the same way,

78
00:06:47,187 --> 00:06:49,621
only she was sitting
on a stool in a drugstore.

79
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:52,453
One of them's a writer,
and one of them's a producer.

80
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:54,959
That's just where I've been now.
They asked me to their office,

81
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:57,462
and I signed a contract,
and they start shooting me tomorrow.

82
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,296
- Shooting you?
- Lily, that's a show business
expression, like "Roll 'em,"

83
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:04,700
"Lights, '" "Action, '" "Anchors away, '"
that kind of stuff.

84
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:07,865
Well, darling,
this is such a surprise.

85
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:13,106
I know you've got
the looks and the personality,
but you've never had any training.

86
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:17,513
Well, Lily, they explained that it's
a documentary, like Naked City.

87
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:20,075
What they're after
is stark realism.

88
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:23,748
And they said I was as stark
as anything they've ever seen.

89
00:07:23,823 --> 00:07:27,315
Herman, oh, this is...
this is wonderful.

90
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:29,486
You, a movie star!

91
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:32,929
Yes. And, Lily, I'm doing it
all for my family.

92
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:36,594
We're gonna move to Hollywood,
to a nice, expensive house
in Beverly Hills.

93
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,536
And you'll have diamonds,
and Eddie will go to a private school...

94
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:41,767
where they'll spoil him rotten.

95
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:45,174
And, Grandpa, you can fly
back and forth to the Old Country.

96
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:47,645
I do that all the time, anyway.

97
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:50,808
No, but I mean in an airplane,
and first-class.

98
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:53,546
That might not be bad
for a change,

99
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,384
to see how the other half flies.

100
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:58,947
Oh, my son-in-law,
the movie star.

101
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:02,722
Herman, where's that contract?
You better have me look it over.

102
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:05,230
They're keeping it for me
down there on file.

103
00:08:05,298 --> 00:08:08,290
And there's no need to worry.
I looked it over very quickly
before I signed it.

104
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:12,862
And it's got everything in it,
including double indemnity.

105
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:16,636
Double indemnity?
What's that doing in a contract?

106
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:19,473
Well, they explained
that's the title of the picture.

107
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:23,141
It's a remake, and I'm doing
the old Fred MacMurray part.

108
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,184
Oh, dear.

109
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:30,780
Herman, if you have to kiss
your leading lady, I'll just die.

110
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:33,018
Oh, don't put yourself out, dear.

111
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:37,620
But if it bothers you, I'll have them
use doubles for all that mushy stuff.

112
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:42,664
Uh, when does this great epic
start, uh, shooting?

113
00:08:42,735 --> 00:08:47,035
First thing tomorrow morning
on the corner of Mockingbird Lane
and Maple Drive.

114
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:49,097
Oh!
How thrilling.

115
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:51,143
We'll all be down to watch you.

116
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:54,908
Oh, no, you don't.
Uh, not tomorrow morning.

117
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:58,280
You see, they're shooting the big scene.
They're shooting the end of the picture.

118
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:00,717
They shoot the end
of the picture first?

119
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:02,721
Oh, they always do.

120
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:05,553
And I know it's the end
because as I was leaving the office,

121
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:09,061
I heard the producer say to the writer,
"Tomorrow will really be
the finish for him."

122
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:13,855
[Laughing]

123
00:09:17,804 --> 00:09:21,103
Would you run through the scene
just once more, Mr.J.R.?

124
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:24,871
Why, certainly. Now, this is
the climax of the picture.

125
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:28,903
Now, you, as the hero, are
on your way to meet the girl,

126
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:31,917
when, suddenly, you step
off the curb and, whammo!

127
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:35,352
You are struck down
by a speeding car.

128
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:38,982
Couldn't that be a little dangerous?
Yeah, well, it don't
actually hit you.

129
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:43,586
It kind of swerves and
misses you at the last minute.
Gotcha.

130
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:53,705
Excuse me.
Yeah?

131
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:55,866
Excuse me,
but where's the camera?

132
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:58,376
Oh, uh, the camera.
Well, uh, I'll tell you, Munster.

133
00:09:58,444 --> 00:10:03,882
For the sake of realism,
we've got the camera hidden
in that mail truck over there.

134
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,783
Very clever.

135
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:09,447
[Chuckling]
Get ready, Alfred!

136
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:15,353
Just one more question.

137
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:18,864
Why is your writer driving the car
that's almost gonna hit me?

138
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:21,594
My writer? Uh, well, because...

139
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:24,364
not only is Alfred another
Tennessee Williams,

140
00:10:24,437 --> 00:10:28,373
but he also happens to be
the greatest stunt driver
in Hollywood.

141
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:30,375
Well, that's nice.

142
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:34,980
Okay, Alfred!

143
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:43,985
[Tires Squealing]

144
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:47,220
J.R.?
Yeah, what is it now?

145
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:50,854
Well, you forgot to yell, "Roll 'em,"
and all that kind of stuff.

146
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,559
We can't forget that, can we?

147
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:57,000
I forgot to say "Roll 'em."

148
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,608
Let's go again, Alfred!

149
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:09,409
Roll 'em!

150
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:26,197
[Sighs]

151
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:28,563
You know something,J.R.?

152
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:30,795
What, Munster?

153
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,863
If he doesn't write any better
than he drives, we're in big trouble.

154
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:40,704
May I have my tea now,
Aunt Lily?

155
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,375
In a minute, Marilyn, as soon
as the whistling teakettle boils.

156
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,648
[Factory Whistle]

157
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:50,882
There we are.

158
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:57,262
Oh, thank you.

159
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,491
Oh, by the way, Herman phoned.

160
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:02,557
He said they're gonna shoot the movie
in a vacant alley this afternoon.

161
00:12:02,635 --> 00:12:05,331
They ran into some kind
of trouble on the street.

162
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:08,306
It'll be neat, having a father
who's a real movie star.

163
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:11,309
It's a very colorful
profession, Eddie.

164
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:13,811
When I was younger
in the Old Country,

165
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,713
I used to hang around the stage door
and put the bite on all the actors.

166
00:12:16,783 --> 00:12:19,047
You borrowed money from them?

167
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:21,882
No, I put the bite on 'em.

168
00:12:21,954 --> 00:12:24,787
I bet Herman'll be tired and hungry
when he gets home.

169
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:29,453
I think I'll put a little something
out on the table for him to nibble on.

170
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:34,562
[Sighs]
He just loves his little snacks.

171
00:12:36,903 --> 00:12:38,871
Now, Herman, in this scene,

172
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:41,372
you're leaning against the building
right over here.

173
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:44,535
You're reading this newspaper,
and you're waiting for your sweetheart.

174
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,239
I see. Uh... Oh.

175
00:12:48,314 --> 00:12:51,215
Right on this chalk mark.
Right.

176
00:12:51,284 --> 00:12:53,479
That's it.
Ah-ah, not quite so far.

177
00:12:53,553 --> 00:12:56,522
A little bit to the left, Herman.
A little bit more.

178
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:59,149
That's the idea.
[Laughing]

179
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:01,853
That's good.

180
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:05,227
That's fine, Hermie.
Just like that.

181
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:07,232
Perfect.

182
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,632
Yeah, that's great.
Oh.

183
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:14,598
Excuse me, Mr.J.R.,
but where's the camera this time?

184
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:19,373
Oh, uh, the camera?
Oh, uh, you see that
ice cream truck over there?

185
00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:21,606
Hmm?
Here. Over here.

186
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:24,844
- Oh, yes.
- It's hidden inside.

187
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:28,353
Good thinking. But,J.R.,
it occurred to me that the camera...

188
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:31,185
Look, Herman, why're you
making a big thing out of it?

189
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:35,660
All you have to do is stand
right here on the chalk mark and
don't do nothin' till I yell, "Action!"

190
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:37,923
- Well, what about "Roll 'em"?
- "Action"!

191
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:51,641
I never realized how hard moving pictures
were on producers and writers. Hmm.

192
00:13:51,711 --> 00:13:53,804
Herman, the first day of shooting,

193
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,839
and they're shutting down
the picture already?
I hope they haven't called it off.

194
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:00,408
You said you were
gonna be a movie star,

195
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:02,784
and I've been out all afternoon
pricing mink shrouds.

196
00:14:02,855 --> 00:14:06,450
Yeah, and I've been practicing
to be a precocious little brat,

197
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:08,619
so I'll be ready when
I move to Hollywood.

198
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:11,788
Now, listen, everybody.
Just calm down.

199
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:15,823
They said it was just a temporary
postponement till the producer
gets out of the hospital.

200
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:17,836
He's got a concussion.

201
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:21,863
They said it was one of those
temporary little delays that happen
all the time in Hollywood.

202
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:24,705
Well, I'm glad everything's
gonna be all right.

203
00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:28,941
Oh, Herman, I just can't wait
to see your face on a wide screen,

204
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:31,984
40 feet wide and 20 feet tall.

205
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:34,645
The audiences' eyes
will just pop out.

206
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,655
Oh, I think it's gonna be
an excellent picture.

207
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:41,887
J.R. Told me they're working
on a new ending for tomorrow
that's gonna be a killer.

208
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:47,659
How does it look,J.R.?
Great, Alfred.

209
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:50,827
Now, all we have to do is to get
Munster to go through that door,

210
00:14:50,903 --> 00:14:54,202
and then it's one, two, three,
instant double indemnity.

211
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:59,401
[Alfred Whistles]

212
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:03,744
I just hope he don't land on somebody
and get us a counterclaim.

213
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:06,649
Stop worrying, will you?
We'll be at that claims office,

214
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:10,086
collecting on a policy
before he even hits the ground.

215
00:15:12,058 --> 00:15:15,960
Uh... Uh, close the door.
I can't stand heights.

216
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:22,199
I just told Spot about moving to
Hollywood, and he's real excited.

217
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:24,202
Oh, good!

218
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,296
Hey, Spot, how would you
like to meet Lassie?

219
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:29,967
[Growling]

220
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:33,773
How would you like to meet
Ed, the talking horse?
[Growling]

221
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:37,441
Hey, uh, Spot, would you like
to meet Carroll Baker?

222
00:15:37,516 --> 00:15:39,677
[Growling]

223
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:42,050
Oh, Grandpa, stop that.

224
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:44,715
Spot was never that way
till you let him eat...

225
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,248
that copy of The Carpetbaggers.
Good morning, all.

226
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:53,357
[All]
Ooh.!

227
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:57,266
Herman, you're magnificent!
You look so glamorous.

228
00:15:57,336 --> 00:15:59,463
Pop, you're a gas!

229
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:02,530
Please, fans, no autographs.

230
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:04,735
The Method Actor?

231
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,904
One must dig deep to come up
with the right character.

232
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,814
You're telling me.
That's how I found my first 10 wives.

233
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:15,816
Well, I must be going.

234
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:18,880
Good-bye, dear.
We're shooting interiors today.

235
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,860
I'll try to give you a blast
on the horn between takes.
[Chuckles]

236
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:25,897
This is the most exciting thing
that ever happened...

237
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:27,899
you in pictures.

238
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:30,026
Lily, dear, tut, tut, tut, tut.

239
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:33,594
When one has talent,
one must take these things in stride.

240
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:36,808
Bye, all.

241
00:16:44,617 --> 00:16:46,551
[Sighs]

242
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:49,850
Now, Munster, this is the most crucial
scene of the whole picture,

243
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:51,856
although it's a simple one.

244
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:55,257
Simple?
Right. Now, when we open up,
you're seated at the desk.

245
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:57,819
I'm seated.
Right. When I give you the cue,

246
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:00,263
you get up,
run across the room,

247
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:04,167
fling open that door marked
"private" and step inside.

248
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:08,172
I think I get it.
I get up, go across the room,

249
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,073
fling open that door
and step inside.

250
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:14,670
Right.
Just a minute now,
and I'll check the set.

251
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:22,886
All set.
All set?

252
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:25,116
Uh, no.
No?

253
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:27,557
No?
No.

254
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:29,753
What's the motivation?

255
00:17:31,197 --> 00:17:34,291
Alfred, give him the motivation.
Uh, uh, me? Uh, uh...

256
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:37,200
Oh. Uh, well...

257
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:40,761
Well, you see, you're working
here at the office, see,

258
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,206
and it's, uh...
it's late at night.

259
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:47,211
And then suddenly from
the other room you hear a scream.
It's your sweetheart.

260
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,112
You jump up,
and you run to the door,

261
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:52,207
and you say, "I'm coming, darling!"

262
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:54,252
And you dash inside.

263
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,551
All right. Shall we...
Shall we make it?

264
00:17:57,623 --> 00:18:00,786
Uh, no.
No?

265
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,761
No. As they say in Hollywood,

266
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:06,491
it... just doesn't grab me.

267
00:18:09,802 --> 00:18:13,670
It's right here, Lily... another
article about that accident ring.

268
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:15,673
Good heavens, Grandpa!

269
00:18:15,741 --> 00:18:18,574
It says, "They pose
as movie producers...

270
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:21,477
"to lure their victims
into accidents.

271
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:23,481
Then they collect the insurance."

272
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:27,451
And that big dummy Herman signed
a contract with double indemnity.

273
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,353
Now they're gonna wreck him
and collect on the accident.

274
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:32,448
Oh, my poor Herman!

275
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:36,222
They'll hurt my sweet baby.
What'll we do?

276
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:40,254
I can't let anything happen to him.
Who's gonna support me in my old age?

277
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:43,665
Oh, this is terrible.
[Growling]

278
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:47,695
Don't panic, Spot.
Turn down your burner.
Give us a chance to think.

279
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:51,675
We've gotta keep cool.
The thing to do is call the police.

280
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:54,304
Oh, come on, Grandpa. Let's.

281
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,314
Well, what's the matter?

282
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:59,545
I forgot where the phone is.
Oh, Grandpa!

283
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:07,322
Now, look, Munster.
I rewrote the whole scene for you.

284
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:10,260
Will you listen to it?
Shoot.

285
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:13,093
This is the office of the boss
of the syndicate.

286
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:15,099
Right.

287
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:17,897
Now, it's late at night.
Yeah?

288
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,905
And you're going through the desk,
looking for the papers...

289
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:24,431
that'll save the United States
from being blown to bits.

290
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,479
Huh.
Now, suddenly,

291
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:29,673
from the next room,
you hear a scream.

292
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:33,115
Uh, but it's not
my sweetheart again.

293
00:19:33,185 --> 00:19:35,949
What sweetheart?
It's... It's your mother.
Yeah.

294
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:39,582
Mother?
Yeah, your mother that you
haven't seen in 26 years.

295
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:42,525
I think it might be
a little too cliché.

296
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:45,428
Well, y-y-you
didn't let me finish.

297
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:49,093
You see, because after
the scream, you hear a bark.

298
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:52,160
Bark?
Yeah, a bark... woof, woof!

299
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:54,866
Because tied up in there
with your mother...

300
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,773
is the collie dog that
pulled you out of the well...

301
00:19:57,843 --> 00:20:01,006
when you was a little
bitty boy in Scotland.

302
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,640
Now you're talking motivation.

303
00:20:03,716 --> 00:20:06,651
All right now!
Then let's make a take.
What do you say?

304
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:08,880
Right.
Right.

305
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:12,185
There we go.
All right.

306
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:14,818
Sit down... in the seat.

307
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:17,385
That's the idea. Ready. A...

308
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:22,158
Action!

309
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:24,327
Start going through the drawers.

310
00:20:27,606 --> 00:20:29,699
Now you hear your mother scream.

311
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:32,005
[J.R. Screaming]

312
00:20:32,077 --> 00:20:35,410
And the dog bark!
Woof, woof!

313
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,520
- Now what's the matter?
- We left the camera in the ice cream truck.

314
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,194
No, no!

315
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:56,257
That's right, Officer. And now
they're gonna stage an accident...

316
00:20:56,335 --> 00:20:58,428
and collect on his insurance.

317
00:20:58,504 --> 00:21:00,438
Tell them to hurry, Grandpa.

318
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:03,998
They may be doing away with
Herman at this very moment.

319
00:21:04,076 --> 00:21:07,239
He says, unless someone stole
our bicycle, he can't help us.

320
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:11,579
Oh!
He's giving me another department.

321
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,710
Now, look, Munster.
Everything is all set.

322
00:21:14,787 --> 00:21:16,721
Now, pay attention. Here.

323
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:19,781
The camera is behind
this picture. All right?

324
00:21:19,858 --> 00:21:22,452
Your mother and the dog
are in the other room.

325
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:27,295
Now, let's make a take, huh,
for the final and last time?
You ready?

326
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:29,357
Uh...

327
00:21:35,341 --> 00:21:37,901
Ready.
All right. Action!

328
00:21:42,414 --> 00:21:45,406
Now you hear your mother
scream. Aaah!

329
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:47,475
Woof, woof.

330
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:51,980
Coming, Mother!

331
00:21:53,993 --> 00:21:55,984
Here! Here!

332
00:21:56,061 --> 00:21:58,052
Here.!

333
00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:03,524
You're in the closet!

334
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:06,696
Look, it's not this door.
It's this door!

335
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:09,366
A baby can do it, it's so simple!

336
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:12,274
All you do is you go to this door,
open the door...

337
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:14,938
and step inside!

338
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:26,019
Say, uh,

339
00:22:26,091 --> 00:22:29,322
uh, there's no mother in there,

340
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:32,159
or a dog or anything.

341
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:35,064
Uh, there's not
even a room in there.

342
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:38,433
They must've moved it.
I think you fellows
are trying to hurt me.

343
00:22:38,504 --> 00:22:42,838
You know, if you keep this up,
I might get very angry.

344
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:46,469
I might even report you
to the Better Business Bureau.

345
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:48,536
Mm, so there.

346
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:56,713
So you see, Herman,

347
00:22:56,789 --> 00:23:00,850
they were trying to injure you
to collect on the policy you signed.

348
00:23:00,926 --> 00:23:02,951
You know, Lily,

349
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:05,462
there oughta be a law
against things like this.

350
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:08,932
Law? Of course there's a law.
And as law-abiding citizens,

351
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:13,301
we are gonna go to the police station
and file a complaint against these crooks.

352
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:16,864
Herman, you had us so worried.

353
00:23:16,942 --> 00:23:20,969
One of these days,
you'll put us all in an early grave.

354
00:23:21,046 --> 00:23:22,980
Isn't that just like Lily?

355
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:25,243
Always looking at
the bright side of things.

356
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:29,879
And let's be thankful
we've seen the last of these men.

357
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:36,688
Yeah,J.R., I think the big goon
finally got wise to us.

358
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:39,697
Our next move
is to get out of town.
Yeah?

359
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:42,859
But first we're gonna make a little call
on our friend Herman Munster...

360
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:45,165
and put him
on permanent suspension...

361
00:23:45,237 --> 00:23:48,331
in that big movie studio
in the sky.

362
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:56,605
Gee, what a creepy place.
Looks like rigor mortis set in.

363
00:23:56,682 --> 00:24:01,415
Yeah, and it's about to set in
on Mr. Herman Munster.

364
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:03,512
Open the door.
Why me?

365
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:05,682
Open the door!

366
00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:09,556
[Door Creaking]

367
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:21,234
He must be upstairs.
Call him. We'll take care of him.

368
00:24:21,306 --> 00:24:24,605
Mr. Munster. Herman, baby.

369
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:27,873
Come on down.
We got something for ya.

[Growling]
[Yelling]

371
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,816
[Gasps]
Did you hear that?
I think something frightened Spot.

372
00:24:40,592 --> 00:24:43,459
Boy, Spot must've been
really shook up.

373
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:46,521
He burned all the paint
off the door.
