1
00:00:05,886 --> 00:00:08,354
Now, Wilbur, I'll show you
something special.

2
00:00:08,422 --> 00:00:10,356
[Chuckles]

3
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:20,061
[Metal Creaking]

4
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:36,315
There you go, Wilbur.

5
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:38,874
Gee, thanks, Mr. Munster.

6
00:00:38,952 --> 00:00:41,944
Well, Eddie, I, uh,
can't sit around here
tying knots all day.

7
00:00:42,022 --> 00:00:44,684
The car has a flat,
and I promised Grandpa
I'd hold it up...

8
00:00:44,758 --> 00:00:46,692
while he changes the tire.

9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,695
Good-bye, Wilbur.
Good-bye, sir.

10
00:00:49,763 --> 00:00:54,928
Boy, Eddie, you got
the neatest father
in the whole neighborhood.

11
00:01:00,207 --> 00:01:04,337
Jerry, look.
If we can sign up this guy,
Herman Munster,

12
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:08,575
we'll have the greatest gimmick
in wrestling since the Swedish Angel.

13
00:01:08,648 --> 00:01:10,912
Yeah. Why,

14
00:01:10,984 --> 00:01:15,045
he ties knots in steel bars.

15
00:01:17,657 --> 00:01:21,684
A-A-And lifts automobiles
off the ground.

16
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:26,529
Mm-hmm.
No, his kid goes to school
with my Wilbur.

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,001
No, I haven't met him yet,
but believe me,

18
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,565
when he climbs into the ring,
he'll have the people
falling in the aisles.

19
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:48,277
Oh. This Chinese tea always acts up
when we put it in the Russian samovar.

20
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:52,751
That certainly was
a very nice dinner
you served tonight, Lily.

21
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:55,310
Oh, thank you, dear.

22
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:57,356
Oh, the soup was delicious.

23
00:02:57,424 --> 00:03:00,325
But the croutons
kept crawling out of the bowl.

24
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:03,829
Don't worry about that, Grandpa.
They always come back.

25
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:08,664
Lily, uh, uh,
did you read this article?

26
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:12,671
It says here that 35% of the parents
who want to send their children
to college...

27
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:14,764
don't have the money
when the time comes.

28
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:16,775
Oh, that shouldn't
worry us now, Herman.

29
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:19,368
Eddie won't be ready for college
for a long time yet.

30
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:21,812
No, but it says
we should start planning now.

31
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:24,476
Set a little bit aside every year.

32
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:30,183
Back in the Old Country,
we always buried a little something
in the backyard for a rainy day.

33
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:32,350
You know,
Eddie should go to college.

34
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:35,326
After all, his father
was a college man.

35
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:38,330
How long were you at
the Heidelburg University, dear?

36
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:40,332
How long?

37
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,028
I was in their medical school
for six years...

38
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:46,004
in several different jars.

39
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:50,406
Yes, Lily, your husband
was a man of parts.

40
00:03:50,477 --> 00:03:52,536
You know, we've got to
send Eddie to college,

41
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:54,705
even if it means
I have to borrow the money.

42
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:57,750
[Grandpa]
Telephone.
What?

43
00:03:57,817 --> 00:04:02,151
The telephone in the hall?
It's about to ring.
Why wait till the last minute?

44
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:05,055
Oh. Thank you, Grandpa.

45

00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:27,169
Hello?

50
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:30,080
Mr. Ramsey?
Wilbur's father.

51
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,018
Mr. Munster,
I have a proposition
to make you.

52
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:36,521
Really? A proposition?

53
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,618
I hope that's not
another salesman on the phone,
trying to sell cemetery plots.

54
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:46,928
We have enough trouble
making the payments on this place
without thinking of resort property.

55
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:53,439
Well, I could, uh, use
the $200 or $300 extra a week,
but wrestling?

56
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:55,440
[Chuckles]
My goodness.

57
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:58,033
What would my family
and friends think?

58
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:02,411
If it's your friends and family
you're worried about,
nobody has to know.

59
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:07,044
We'll put a hood over your head
and bill you as The Masked Marvel.

60
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,054
It'll be a great gimmick.

61
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:14,059
The Masked Marvel?
Uh, you mean, nobody
could see my face?

62
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:18,188
Well, I sure could use the money.

63
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:20,960
Uh, I just might go for it.

64
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:24,197
Uh, listen, Mr. Ramsey.
Just give me a few days
to get in shape,

65
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,465
and I'll get in touch with you.

66
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:29,667
Mum's the word, now.
Bye.

67
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,182
He ties knots in steel bars
and needs to get in shape?

[Laughing]
Our problems are solved.

69
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,126
When you grow up,
you're gonna go to college
after all.

70
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:54,258
Oh, isn't that wonderful.
Now maybe you'll grow up to be
half the man your father is.

71
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:58,896
Oh, boy!
You're gonna be your daddy's
big, smart, successful son.

There goes Uncle Herman
with that pounding again.

I wish he'd tell us
what he's doing
down there in the lab.

79
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:33,272
He's been spending
most of his time down there
now for three days.

80
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:37,537
He won't even let me in.
He says he's just in training
for his new job.

81
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,010
I wonder what he meant
when he said it's night work.

82
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,538
There's only one decent kind
of night work I know of,

83
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:47,052
and I haven't done any
since I left the Old Country.

It's not Igor, Herman.
It's me.

97
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:52,776
I just had to fly down here
to see what you're up to.

98
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:56,379
Grandpa, don't you know
that curiosity killed the bat?

99
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:59,448
But satisfaction
brought him back.

100
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:05,894
Oh, wrestling.

101
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:09,401
Now, this is the night work
you've been coming down here
training for.

102
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:13,405
Grandpa, I didn't want
anyone to know.

103
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:17,603
Some promoter's offered me
$300 a week if I'll appear
as The Masked Marvel.

00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:21,907
You, a wrestler?

106
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:24,313
You won't even draw flies.

107
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:28,184
Oh, on the contrary,
I'm sure I will.

108
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:31,815
But why you?
Of all people, lowering
the Munster dignity.

109
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:36,555
Because I want my son
to go to college.

110
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:41,195
I misjudged you, Herman.
But don't worry.

00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:44,600
I won't tell anyone
your secret. Shh.

Thank you.

Okay, wrestle!

Grandpa, do we have to
watch wrestling?

Well, I just thought wrestling
might be nice for a change.

Yeah, leave it on.
Wrestling's my favorite show.

as each looks for an opening.

Uh-oh, Tarzan McGirk clamps on
his famous headlock.

Yes, there's action
here tonight.

Hey, that Tarzan guy's neat.
He always plays the good guy.

he's so much bigger.

Come on, Tarzan.
Don't let him do that.

dominated the match.

00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:43,708
McGirk goes down again!

155
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:45,751
He's such a brute.
I can't watch.

156
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:48,013
What's he doing?

157
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:51,181
The back vault!
Wow! Ladies and gentlemen,

158
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:53,191
now The Masked Marvel
is really mad.

159
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:56,023
Oh, oh. Doesn't look
as though he has a chance.

160
00:11:56,095 --> 00:12:00,122
[Crowd Jeering]

161
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:02,167
The Masked Marvel
is really something.

162
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:31,157
This is the match of the century.
I'm certainly glad
that Masked Marvel...

163
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,460
got the worst of it.
I am too.

164
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:36,058
They shouldn't let
a big bully like that
in the ring.

165
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:39,070
McGirk won.
I can't understand it.

166
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:41,698
I do, Grandpa.

167
00:12:41,774 --> 00:12:44,208
I think the bad guy
was supposed to win.

168
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:49,112
But that Masked Marvel's so dumb,
he forgot he was the bad guy
and let that good guy win.

169
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:55,083
Oh, well, I'm not feeling so well.
I think I'll take a ride in the car.

170
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:57,987
Yeah, and on the way home,
I'll pick up Herman from work.

171
00:12:58,057 --> 00:13:02,790
Grandpa, couldn't you just give us
a little hint about what kind
of work he's in?

172
00:13:02,862 --> 00:13:06,696
L-I'm sorry, Lily. I can't.
But I can tell you this though.

173
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:10,793
That boy is sure
starting at the bottom.

174
00:13:20,346 --> 00:13:23,975
I can't understand it, Herman.
I saw the match on television.

175
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:29,249
I haven't seen such a dive
since I was forced down
by a vulture over Transylvania.

176
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:32,723
Grandpa, I just couldn't
help myself.

177
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:37,388
Every time I got Tarzan McGirk
down on the mat,
he talked to me.

178
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:39,397
Talked to you?
Yeah.

179
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:42,457
Well, I didn't have the heart
to beat him.

180
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:45,504
Do you know that
he's supporting four children?

181
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:47,698
And that his wife's sister
is living with them?

182
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:51,436
And that he has to send
his sick grandmother in Ireland
money for medical expenses?

183
00:13:51,511 --> 00:13:55,242
What kind of
medical expenses?
Oh, it's pathetic.

184
00:13:55,314 --> 00:13:57,714
She's too poor to afford a doctor,

185
00:13:57,783 --> 00:14:01,116
so every week she buys
nine dollars worth of moldy bread...

186
00:14:01,187 --> 00:14:03,451
and makes her own penicillin.

187
00:14:04,924 --> 00:14:09,054
Oh, boy! And for this
you threw the fight!

188
00:14:09,128 --> 00:14:11,358
I didn't throw the fight.

189
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,763
L-I just couldn't be mean to McGirk
after he told me all his troubles.

190
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:18,531
He's really a very nice man.
His troubles?

191
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:23,098
What about your troubles?
Eddie's education is at stake.

192
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:26,942
You've gotta climb
into that ring, son,
not as Herman Munster...

193
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:29,914
but as every proud father
fighting for his little boy.

194
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:34,248
This is not just
a wrestling match.
This is a shining crusade.

195
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,515
A contest
on the battlefield of life...

196
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,616
that will leave you
a stronger and nobler person.

197
00:14:40,693 --> 00:14:42,627
Really?

198
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:46,859
Of course.
The next bum comes along,
get in there and kick him in the teeth!

199
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:52,897
[Wind Whistling]

200
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:54,997
Boy, you should have
been here last night, Pop.

201
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:57,065
We watched wrestling
on television.

202
00:14:57,143 --> 00:15:02,240
Yes, Herman, they had
some big awful bully
called The Masked Marvel.

203
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:04,545
Yeah, he was clobbering
some guy smaller than him,

204
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:08,212
but then The Masked Marvel
turned chicken and rolled over
on his back.

205
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,687
I've never seen anything
like it, Uncle Herman.

206
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:14,852
Yeah, Pop, you should have been here
to see that big dope coward.

207
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:18,055
Yeah, yeah,
I should have been here.

208
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:22,690
Well, how could he be here?
He was away working
on his new job.

209
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:26,932
That's right.
I can't be in two places
at once... anymore.

210
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:30,635
Herman, I've been looking up
colleges for Eddie,
for when he grows up,

211
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,644
and I wanna go over them
with you.

212
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:37,411
Please, Lily. Let's just see
how the new job works out
before we decide on a school.

213
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:40,316
Herman's right.
One thing at a time.

214
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:44,789
You know the old saying:
No sense in putting
the hearse before the horse.

215
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:52,727
[Crowd Cheering]

216
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:56,962
I tell ya... if I lose this match,
my son has to drop out
of med school.

217
00:15:57,036 --> 00:16:01,769
Uh, good heavens, man!
Why didn't you tell me?

I said break it up!

221

my sister's banjo,

222
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:26,223
she'll be kicked out
of the Boston Symphony.

Hey, boss, when you gonna
dump this Munster guy?

230
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:17,446
He's lost eight matches in a row.
Even the crowd's getting tired
of booing him.

231
00:17:17,516 --> 00:17:22,749
Look, Jerry,
I've got one more gimmick
that might appeal to the fans.

232
00:17:22,822 --> 00:17:27,020
Beginning tonight,
I'm offering $50 a minute...

233
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:29,288
to any cluck from the audience...

234
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:32,354
for as long as he can stay
in the ring with The Masked Marvel.

235
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:35,525
Uh, what is it I'm supposed
to do again, Mr. Hansen?

236
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:39,037
Strangler, you saw
the sign outside.

237
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:43,565
Fifty bucks a minute
for any amateur who stays
in the ring with this guy.

238
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:46,475
Well, tonight, you walk up
like any schnook from the audience...

239
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:48,877
and toss him around
for about 25 minutes.

240
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:52,543
Yeah, but, uh,
this guy's pretty big.

241
00:17:52,618 --> 00:17:54,552
What if I can't handle him?

242
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,554
Well, how did you handle
the other guys...

243
00:17:56,622 --> 00:18:01,116
uh, Iron Man Mallory,
Benny Sampson
and Charlie the Choker?

244
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:05,357
You put sleeping pills
in their drinking water.

245
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:09,094
Okay. So tonight
I do the same thing
to The Masked Marvel.

246
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:13,571
I'm gonna dump this whole bottle
in the water cooler
in his dressing room.

247
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:19,236
He'll be so groggy,
your biggest problem will be
keeping him awake during the match.

248
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:22,906
You're sure a smart fella,
Mr. Hansen.

249
00:18:22,982 --> 00:18:26,281
But ain't this just
a little bit dishonest?

250
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:28,946
Fifty dollars a minute.

with 1,250 bucks.

Oh, Eddie, you're not going to
turn on wrestling again tonight.

254

I don't think I can watch
that Masked Marvel
one more time.

255
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:49,538
He's nothing but a bully
and a coward, and he loses
all the time.

256
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:53,135
I know, but the paper
says it's amateur night.

257
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:55,680
I just wanna watch
this one match.

might win this time.

was this interested in wrestling.

of titans here tonight, folks.

to sit on that Masked Marvel,

that's who it is.

302
00:21:11,116 --> 00:21:13,880
So, you brought
a ringer in, huh?

303
00:21:13,953 --> 00:21:17,184
That's Strangler Murphy!
He's no amateur.

304
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:20,248
It's a frame-up!

305

[Announcer On TV, Indistinct]
Uh-oh, what's Grandpa
gonna do?

306
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:35,073
I don't know, but he better do it quick.

307
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:39,008
You wanna play games?
I'll show you how to play games.

308
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:44,641
Abracadabra, acey-docey,
alakazam and Bela Lugosi!

309
00:21:44,717 --> 00:21:47,413
[Electrical Surge]

310
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:52,983
Boss, we gotta stop the fight.
Are you kidding?

311
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:55,652
No, no, no.
There's a fire broke out
in the storage room out back.

312
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:58,094
Al and the boys
are trying to put it out.

313
00:21:58,163 --> 00:22:00,825
Look. This is the best attraction
we ever had.

314
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:04,300
Tell 'em to close the fire door.
That oughta hold it back
till the fight's over.

315
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,134
But, Duke...
Go do it, will you?

316
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:12,802
Bombs away, Herman!

317
00:22:29,128 --> 00:22:31,255
Hey, Munster!

318
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,026
We got a little fire
out in back.
Really?

319
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:37,660
Yeah, yeah. You gotta
make an announcement
to clear the arena.

320
00:22:37,736 --> 00:22:40,534
I'll... I'll try.
Good.

321
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:47,544
Ladies and gentlemen,
you must leave.

322
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:50,980
[Herman Continues, Indistinct]

323
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:55,783
Uh... Uh, you see... uh...

324
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,460
Was that quick enough
for you, Mr. Ramsey?

325
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:14,332
Mr... Mr. Ramsey?

326
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:16,431
Mr. Ramsey?

327
00:23:16,508 --> 00:23:18,442
Mr. Ramsey?

328
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:24,976
"Last night
at the Meadow Brook Stadium,

329
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,712
"a newcomer to the wrestling game,
Herman Munster,

330

"persuaded a capacity crowd
to clear the building
in five seconds flat,

334
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:46,762
Oh, that's wonderful,
Uncle Herman!

335
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:48,864
You must have done
some quick thinking, dear.

336
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:51,273
I don't really remember
too much about it.

337
00:23:51,343 --> 00:23:53,402
I was kind of groggy at the time.

338
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:57,279
I guess in the emergency,
I just said the right thing.

339
00:23:58,283 --> 00:24:00,478
And you really clobbered
that other wrestler, Pop.

340
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:02,850
You're the bravest guy
in the whole world.

341
00:24:02,921 --> 00:24:05,446
Thank you, Eddie.
Uh, but, Eddie,

342
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:07,617
I did it all for you.

343
00:24:07,693 --> 00:24:10,355
And that thousand dollars
is going in our vault...

344

as a beginning
on your college fund.

Gee, thanks, Pop.
You're swell.

346
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:18,864
Toss me up in the air again,
will ya?

347
00:24:18,937 --> 00:24:21,428
All righty.
[Chuckles]

348
00:24:21,507 --> 00:24:24,408
Up we go!
[Laughs]

349
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:35,078
Oh, don't worry, Herman.
Have your hotcakes.

He'll be down
before breakfast is over.
