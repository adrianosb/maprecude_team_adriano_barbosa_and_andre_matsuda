But before we start,

Eddie has some news
for us tonight about school,
haven't you, Eddie?

That's right. This Saturday night
is talent night at school.

- Yeah. It's going to be held
in the school gym.

And if any kid has someone
in his family who has talent,

8
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:35,506
he's supposed to volunteer
them to perform.

9

And did you volunteer a member
of your family to perform?

10
00:00:38,618 --> 00:00:43,021
Oh, sure. I volunteered the one
who has the most talent off all.
Fine.

- Oh, I didn't volunteer you, Grandpa.

to practice his magic act,
so he'll be all ready for tonight.

149
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:34,185
He's so proud thinking he can do magic.
I hope nothing goes wrong.

150
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,696
How can anything go wrong?
If he sticks to the tricks in this book,

151
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:41,199
there's not a chance of him
making a boob of himself.

Well, Herman, you're on next.
This is your chance, Herman.

Grandpa, Grandpa, Grandpa.
Calm down, calm down.

155
00:14:01,187 --> 00:14:03,280
Anyone would think
you were performing.

156
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:06,792
Just stand in the wings and watch.
[Chuckles]

157
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:19,234
Yes. Uh, thank you very much,
Teddy Branston's father.

[Applause]

159

Now I'm sure you all recognized
"Clair de Lune" too.
[Applause]

Now, uh, according to our program here,
we're in for a real treat.

00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:35,685
Uh, we have magic, uh, as performed
by Munster the Magnificent!

Now where did that come from?

165
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:56,637
I get it. It's a gag.
He's a clown magician.

166
00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:00,668
Yeah. What a getup.
Gee, look at the size of that guy.

167
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:04,705
Wow! Looks like there could be
two fathers inside that costume.
Yeah.

168
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:07,048
I'd like to introduce myself.

169
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:12,147
I'm Herman Munster, and my family's
in the iron and steel business.

170
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:14,557
My mother irons
and my father steals.

Oh, oh, you're too kind. Thank you.

Tonight, I have some amazing
magic in store for you,

but first, I would like to introduce
my assistant, Marilyn Munster.

Now you know what's
been holding up the act.

183
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,723
These aren't mine.
They belong to my brother-in-law.

184
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:03,360
But he doesn't need them.
His wife is the one who wears
the pants in his family.

Grandpa! Wasn't there
a rabbit in that hat?

187
00:17:12,912 --> 00:17:17,212
I got it out just in time.
The big goof!

188
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:20,815
And now, miss,

189
00:17:20,886 --> 00:17:26,051
if you would permit me
to place this egg on your head.

190

And now, if you will
watch my assistant closely.

I guess she must have
had bats in her belfry.

194
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:09,694
The last time I saw a ham that big,
it was in a butcher's window.

195
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:12,966
And now for the grand finale.

196
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:22,580
My wife is standing in the wings.

197
00:18:22,648 --> 00:18:26,550
I'm going to ask my wife
to come out here on stage,

198
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:32,353
and I am then going to proceed
to make my wife disappear.
[Laughing]

199
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:36,327
A trick which any husband
should appreciate.

200
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:39,023
Make me disappear?
What is this?

201
00:18:39,098 --> 00:18:42,329
I don't know.
Th-That trick wasn't in the book.

[Audience Murmuring]
Excuse me.

203

Come on, Lily, we're on.
But, Herman,
you can't do that trick.

204
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:57,280
And just why can't I?
'Cause it's not in the book,
and I don't know it.

205
00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:00,944
Who cares whether you know it or not?
I'm doing the magic.

Come on.
No. Herman,
I have news for you.

Uh, well, Grandpa's been
standing back here in the wings...

208
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:11,123
making all your tricks work for you.

209
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:13,392
That's right.
I've done every one of them.

Oh, I get it. I've been out there
doing magic and making a big hit...
[Audience Stomping Feet]

What?

00:23:02,294 --> 00:23:06,856
I'm a widow

you've got to help me!

You've got to
make Lily reappear!
Me? You're the big magician.

All I do is stand in the wings
and watch.

Oh, Grandpa, Grandpa.
I'm sorry about that.

I don't know what happened.
The trick backfired.

Well, how could that have happened?

270
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:38,186
Well, all I did was...
I'll show you.

271
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:44,792
I put Lily in the cabinet...

272

I pull the curtain,

273
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:53,539
I said a few magic words,

274
00:23:53,612 --> 00:23:56,103
and I push the button...

275
00:23:56,181 --> 00:24:00,117
and then I open the curtains
and she was gone.

276
00:24:00,185 --> 00:24:02,483
Grandpa, you've got to help me.

Lily! Lily, you've...
you've come back!

Hi, Mom. I'm glad you're back.
Pop was really crackin' up.

Oh, was he, Eddie?
Oh, thank you, Grandpa,
thank you.

280
00:24:19,471 --> 00:24:22,406
Lily, sweetheart,
I will never do magic again.

281
00:24:22,474 --> 00:24:25,671
I shall be humble
and contrite and...

282
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:29,612
Oh, Lily, I don't know
what I'd do without you.

283
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:31,808
Believe me, Lily, I don't.

284
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:33,943
Do you really mean that, pussycat?

285
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:36,783
Of course I do, sweetheart.

286
00:24:36,855 --> 00:24:41,918
Besides, your-your name's
on all the bath towels.

287
00:24:41,994 --> 00:24:45,452
And if I ever got married again,
I'd have to find someone named Lily.
