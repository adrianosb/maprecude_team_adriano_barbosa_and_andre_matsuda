[Man]
Ah!
Here we are!

00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:14,516
Look at that bird.
Mother, you've outdone
yourself this time.

5
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:18,581
Just put it down
and let me get started on it.

6
00:01:18,658 --> 00:01:22,287
May we be truly thankful
for what we're about to receive.

That tall, dark,
handsome-looking fellow...

11
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:49,578
you're looking at is me.

12
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:51,583
I guess you're wondering
what's going on here.

13
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:54,381
Well, it all started
about 10 days ago,

14
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:58,720
when I was invited to a reunion
of my old army outfit.

15
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,760
[Lily]
You can't do it.

16
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:03,489
No matter how hard you try,
it just won't fit.

17
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:06,031
I don't understand it.

18
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:09,000
It must have shrunk
since I got out of the army.
[Chuckles]

19
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:12,835
Were you a hero in the war, Dad?

20
00:03:12,906 --> 00:03:15,807
Well, I don't like
to brag, Eddie,

21
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:18,401
but when I'd get up out
of that foxhole,

22
00:03:18,478 --> 00:03:22,244
the enemy would take
one look at me
in this uniform and run.

23
00:03:23,683 --> 00:03:27,380
Come to think of it,
a lot of our guys used to
look at me and run too.

24
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:31,185
You can forget about
wearing it to the reunion.
It just doesn't fit.

25
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:33,590
Look. This is the first time
in 20 years...

26
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,890
the guys from my old outfit
are getting together.

27
00:03:35,962 --> 00:03:38,328
They're all gonna be wearing
their uniforms at the banquet.

28
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:42,892
How will it look if I'm
the only guy to show up in civvies?
They'll all stare at me.

29
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:46,132
Herman, I don't want you
to go at all.

30
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:49,573
I know what goes on
at those so-called reunions.

31
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:54,546
Besides, if there's one thing
you don't need, it's a banquet.

32
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:56,605
Just look at you.

33
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:03,055
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong?

34
00:04:03,123 --> 00:04:06,650
You're too fat.
That's what's wrong.
Fat? Me, fat?

35
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:09,320
Yeah.
Marilyn, I ask you...
am I too fat?

36
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:11,762
- Well...
- Never mind!

37
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:13,765
What are you yelling
at Marilyn for?

38
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,768
I mean, don't you know that
fat men are supposed to be jolly?

39
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:22,468
That's not the issue.
Herman, if you go to that reunion,
you'll be away overnight.

40
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,510
Lily...
Herman,

41
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:27,843
we haven't been separated
in over a hundred years.

42
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:29,848
But, Lily, it's just one night.

43
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,975
I know just the way Lily feels.

44
00:04:32,052 --> 00:04:36,284
I felt the same way about Grandma.
[Sighs]

45
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,588
Oh, she was quite a woman,
your grandma.

46
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:48,691
Lily, I wanna go to the reunion.
I wanna, I wanna! I wanna!

47
00:04:57,143 --> 00:04:59,475
All right, Herman.
I'll tell you what.

48
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:02,106
The reunion is still
10 days away.

49
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:06,812
If you can lose enough weight
to get into your uniform
by then, you can go.

50
00:05:06,886 --> 00:05:09,684
You got yourself a deal.
I'll just stop eating.

51
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:13,886
Oh, no. No, no.
You'll have to to go to a doctor
and have a physical examination.

52
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,360
Get him to put you
on a sensible diet.

53
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:19,330
I don't want a sick corpse
on my hands.

54
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,959
Okay. You've got
yourself a deal.

55
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:24,196
[Man]
What are my appointments today?

56
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,500
[Woman]
Well, you have a new patient...
a Mr. Munster.

57
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:29,064
He's here for a checkup.
Something about a diet.

58
00:05:29,142 --> 00:05:31,633
Then you have a pretty full schedule
till noontime.

59
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:33,645
A diet, huh?
Oh, all right.

60
00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:36,477
Oh, would you take these glasses
down to the optometrist
down the hall?

61
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:41,009
The lens keeps popping out
on me, and I'm so nearsighted,
I can't see a thing without 'em.

62
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:43,419
I'll be right back, Doctor.

63
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:08,772
[Knocking]
Yes. Yes.

64
00:06:11,117 --> 00:06:13,813
Excuse me.
There's no one outside,
and I have an appointment.

65
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:16,412
- I'm Herman Munster.
- Oh, yes.

66
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:20,118
My nurse just
stepped down the hall.
Uh, come in.

67
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:23,356
I'm Doctor Dudley.
How do you do?

68
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,729
Well, Mr. Munster,
I see you brought your doggie.

69
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,327
I'm afraid he'll
have to wait outside
unless he's had his shots.

70
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:34,271
I'm afraid you don't understand.
I'm here for an examination.

71
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,308
I have some weight
to lose in a hurry.

72
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:38,310
Oh, yes.
You're the gentleman.
Who wants the diet.

73
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:41,438
Well, my nurse
just took my glasses
to be repaired, and, uh...

74
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:45,780
I could come back later.
No need. No need.
It's just a routine physical.

75
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:47,820
I could do it blindfolded.

76
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:51,015
Now, if you just
sit down over here,
I'll look you over.

77
00:06:57,097 --> 00:06:59,588
Now,
stick out your tongue.

78
00:07:02,535 --> 00:07:04,469
Doc?

79
00:07:04,537 --> 00:07:08,667
Oh, there you are.
You mustn't be afraid of me.

80
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:13,236
Now, have, uh,
you ever had the measles?

81
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:15,281
Chicken pox?

82
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:19,512
Or the mumps?
Or severe dizziness
or headaches?

83
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:21,577
No. Just the Black Plague.

84
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:25,351
Black Plague?
Very funny.

85
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:31,797
Something wrong?

86
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:37,235
No, no. That's what I get
for buying this equipment
from my brother-in-law.

87
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:39,635
Now, have, uh...

88
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:43,039
have you had your appendix
or, uh, tonsils...

89
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:45,873
or gallbladder
or spleen removed?

90
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:51,481
No, not since
they were first put in.

91
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,746
Quite a comedian,
aren't ya?

92
00:07:55,822 --> 00:07:59,383
Sixty-two point eight?
Why, that's incredible!

93
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:01,359
Oh, not really.

94
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,361
I always run a little fever
when I'm nervous.

95
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:07,456
Well, you mustn't be nervous.
And now I'll take your pulse.

96
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:10,162
Now, look, I told you once...
you got to get
the dog out of here!

97
00:08:10,236 --> 00:08:13,967
Scoot! Scoot!
Doc, that's my hand.

98
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:18,110
Y-You mean you were
born with this?

99
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:21,170
No, someone else was.
And I'll always be grateful.

100
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,579
Not everyone will give you
a hand when you need one.

101
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,948
If you're gonna make me laugh,
we'll be here all day.

102
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:28,954
Now, if you'll just step
over here to the scale,
Mr. Munster.

103
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:33,392
Doc, I hate to contradict you,

104
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:35,893
but the scale is over here.

105
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:40,456
Oh, I'm sorry.
The woman that dusts for me
keeps moving my things.

106
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:43,195
Now, if you'll just step up here.

107
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:47,262
[Bongs Four Times]

108
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,538
4:00 already?
Where's the nurse
with those glasses?

109
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:54,944
Well, shall we check
the old tick-tick-ticker?

110
00:08:55,014 --> 00:08:57,278
Keep the best for the last.

111
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,683
Mr. Munster, now,
if you'll just sit down here.

112
00:09:00,753 --> 00:09:03,017
That... That-a-boy.

113
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:07,216
Here we go.

114
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,991
You know, I just discovered
something extraordinary.

115
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:15,762
I can't hear a thing
without my glasses.

116
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:19,194
Doc...

117
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:25,375
How silly of me.
You ought to be a doctor.

118
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:28,380
[Knocking]
There we are.

119
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:30,678
[Knocking Continues]
Comin' in good.

120
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,684
Doc, I think
there's someone at the door.

121
00:09:32,752 --> 00:09:35,585
[Knocking Continues]
You're right. Excuse me.

122
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:45,193
Here are your glasses, Doctor.
Thank you, Nurse.

123
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:49,929
She's pretty but poky.
Well, shall we, uh,

124
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:52,665
push on, Mr. Munster?

125
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:08,486
Is there a doctor in the house?

126
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:14,583
Lily? Grandpa?

127
00:10:14,661 --> 00:10:17,289
Lily? Oh.
Listen to this.
It's from the doctor.

128
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:20,890
What were the results
of your examination?
"Dear Mr. Munster,

129
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:23,299
"I have studied the results
of your examination...

130
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:25,735
"and have reached
the following conclusions:

131
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:29,707
"Your pulse is 15;
your blood pressure is minus three;

132
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:32,643
body temperature, 62.8;
and heartbeat, none."

133
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:34,543
So far, so good.

134
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:38,106
"Furthermore, it is my duty
as a physician to warn you...

135
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:42,587
that unless you go on the enclosed diet
and lose 100 pounds immediately,
you'll be dead in a week."

136
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:46,885
- But if I'm dead,
I can't go to the reunion.
- Well, I don't know.

137
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,986
That never stopped me
from going anywhere.

138
00:10:50,063 --> 00:10:53,191
I'm gonna lose a hundred pounds
and go to the reunion...

139

even if it kills me.

140

Herman, lunch.

141
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:10,004
I don't know how he's done it.
Six days on nothing
but vitamins and water.

142
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,881
I didn't think he'd really be
able to stick to it this long.

143
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:15,785
Herman. Hurry up.
Your lunch is getting cold.

144
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:20,926
Mmm.
Looks delicious.

145
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:36,039
And what have we here?

146
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:42,874
Vitamins and water.
Oh, Lily.

147
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:46,510
Oh. And a B-12 too.

148
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:49,680
Lily, you shouldn't have gone
to so much trouble.

149
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:54,091
Delicious. Would you pass...

talking about, Doctor, but I do
think you ought to examine him.

in the armed forces?

How many years?

is something about pumpkin pie.

to hold me through the day.

just the thing that will hold you.

00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:19,934
Tonight's the reunion
of his old army outfit.

303
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:24,346
Boy, the way he ate last night,
he'll never get into that uniform!

304
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:29,513
It was very nice of Mrs. Farber
not to send for the police
after the way Herman acted.

305
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:32,489
Mrs. Farber was very understanding.
As a matter of fact,

306
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:35,527
she said whenever her husband
goes on a diet, he acts hardly human.

307
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:37,585
[Chuckles]
Becomes a regular fiend.

308
00:23:37,663 --> 00:23:41,155
Not only did Herman eat
their entire dinner...

309
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:44,828
but he even brought home
the cranberry sauce
in a doggie bag.

310
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:57,744
Gee, Dad, you look great!
Thank you, son.

311
00:23:57,816 --> 00:24:01,183
There certainly is something
about a soldier.

312
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:09,718
I never thought I'd be saying
good-bye to you again in uniform.

313
00:24:09,795 --> 00:24:11,729
Lily, it's just one night,
you know.

314
00:24:11,797 --> 00:24:14,095
I'm not going overseas.

315
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:17,868
What's this?

316
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:20,769
Just my ribs, that's all.

317
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,898
Let's see.
Uh...

318
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:30,281
It's a bulletproof vest.

319
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:34,513
[Laughing]
"Bulletproof vest."
That's Grandma's old corset.

320
00:24:34,586 --> 00:24:38,078
Well, I admit
it's not strictly G.I.,

321
00:24:38,157 --> 00:24:41,024
but that cranberry sauce
sure puts weight on ya!
