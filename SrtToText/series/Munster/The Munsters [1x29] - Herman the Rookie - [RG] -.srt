1
00:00:07,354 --> 00:00:09,379
Oh, tidying up, Lily?

2
00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:11,390
I'm trying to, Grandpa.

3
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:14,950
We must tell Eddie not to let Spot
play with his ball in the house.

4
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:16,962
Where are Eddie and Herman?

5
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,591
Herman took Eddie over to the park
to play a little baseball.

6
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:23,693
Oh, it's so nice to see
a father and son so close.

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,206
Yes, Lily. My father and I
were very close.

8
00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:29,970
And he used to give me
such wonderful advice.

9
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:34,002
I remember one day, he said to me,
"Son, as you go through life,

10
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:36,641
always bury your mistakes."

11
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:40,050
Bury your mistakes?
Yes. You see, my father
never believed in divorce.

12
00:00:46,193 --> 00:00:48,718
Now, Eddie,
to throw a curve ball,

13
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:51,958
you get two fingers around
the top of the ball like this.

14
00:00:52,032 --> 00:00:55,524
And then you squeeze down
to get a nice firm grip.

15
00:00:55,602 --> 00:00:57,763
[Explosion]

16
00:00:57,838 --> 00:01:00,363
[Shudders]
Fiddlesticks!

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,000
Um, uh, uh, give me
another ball, Eddie.

18
00:01:03,076 --> 00:01:07,274
Okay, but just hit a few flies.
All right.

19
00:01:07,347 --> 00:01:10,714
But I've shown you this before,
Eddie. Now watch closely.

20
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,986
[Ball Soaring]
Now, you get a nice open stance.

21
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:19,151
Feet planted firmly on the ground.
Nice firm grip on the bat.

22
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:21,251
Take it back nice and easy.

23
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:24,320
[Ball Descending Rapidly]
'Cause in baseball,
there's a wrong way...

24
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:26,423
and a right way.

25
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:34,635
Uh, that's not the right way.

26
00:01:36,943 --> 00:01:39,104
Now watch this.

27
00:01:40,781 --> 00:01:43,079
[Rocketing]

28
00:01:45,152 --> 00:01:47,177
Uh, throw me another one, Eddie.

29
00:01:47,254 --> 00:01:49,188
But that was my last ball.

30
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:51,190
Huh?

31
00:01:51,258 --> 00:01:54,853
Well, short baseball season,
wasn't it?

32
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:03,468
Mr. Durocher, you really feel
the Dodgers will win
in the first division this year?

33
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:06,870
First division? Look, Charlie,
if we can come up
with a power hitter...

34
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,874
I mean, a guy who can hit
the long ball...

35
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:11,536
I think my old club is a cinch
to win the pennant.

36
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:14,842
[Ball Descending Rapidly]
I've been beating the bushes
looking for a guy...

37
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:17,475
Mr. Durocher! Leo!
Are you all right?

38
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:20,810
Yeah, uh... I'm all right,

39
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:23,754
but how close is the nearest
ballpark around here?

40
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:27,055
It's eight blocks away.
But your head.
Shall I call an ambulance?

41
00:02:27,127 --> 00:02:30,961
Never mind the ambulance.
Where's the guy who hit this ball?

42
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,790
That's right, Walt.
This guy hit a ball
at least seven blocks.

43
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:45,235
How do I know?
It conked me right on the head.

44
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:49,469
Sure, it hurt,
but what's a fractured skull
if it's good for baseball?

45
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:53,104
I was tipped off about this guy
from some of the kids
around the neighborhood.

46
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:57,809
His name is a Mr. Herman Munster
and he lives on Mockingbird Lane.

47
00:03:57,884 --> 00:04:02,082
Don't worry about it, Walt.
I'll have his name on the contract
first thing in the morning.

48
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:05,955
Oh, is this Munster character
gonna be swept right off his feet...

49
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:10,429
with the most sincere, lovable,
charming personality...

50
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:14,331
What do you mean,
"Who am I sending?"

51
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:16,528
I'm going myself!

52
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,207
Ah!
[Lily Chuckles]

53
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:26,211
Oh, my!

54
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,373
[Herman]
Doesn't that look yummy.

55
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,418
How was your morning
at the ballpark, Eddie?

56
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:34,646
It was real crowded
when we got there.

57
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:37,519
By the time Pop got up to bat,
it thinned out.

58
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:42,484
Say, Herman.
Your boss, Mr. Gateman, phoned
and mentioned how busy you are.

59
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:45,156
Things really must be jumping
down at the parlor.

60
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:48,997
Oh, no, they're not.
We keep a very tight lid on everything.

61
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:52,037
But we are busy.
As a matter of fact,

62
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:55,040
I've brought home a lot
of paperwork to do
over the weekend.

63
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:58,077
- You really love your work,
don't you, Uncle Herman?
- Yes, Marilyn.

64
00:04:58,144 --> 00:05:01,739
Nothing could drag me away
from my job down at the parlor.

65
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:05,012
That's right, Herman.
And in just 12 years,

66
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:09,454
the company will give you
a big banquet and a gold shovel.

67
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:11,581
Kind of grabs you,
doesn't it?

68
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:34,847
Boy, I gotta love baseball
to go through this.

69
00:05:35,915 --> 00:05:37,940
[Loud Banging]

70
00:05:40,353 --> 00:05:42,287
Good evening, sir.
May I help you?

71
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:45,256
Yes. Is this the Munster residence?
That's right.

72
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:48,351
I'm Leo Durocher, and I'd like
to see a Herman Munster.

73
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:50,726
Oh, yes. Won't you come in?
Yes.

74
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,230
I've never seen a place
like this in my whole life.

75
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:58,566
Not even in Brooklyn.
Thank you.

76
00:05:58,638 --> 00:06:00,902
My Uncle Herman has some work
to do right now,

77
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:03,340
but you can talk
to my Aunt Lily if you like.
Fine.

78
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,344
Aunt Lily?

79
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:10,475
Aunt Lily, I'd like you
to meet Mr. Leo Durocher.
He'd like to talk to Uncle Herman.

80
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,008
- Oh, how do you do, sir?
- How do you do?

81
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:16,681
I'd like to talk to your husband
on business.

82
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:20,522
I'm sure he'd be glad to arrange
everything in advance for you.

83
00:06:20,593 --> 00:06:24,689
It's always nice to know
where you're going before you go.

84
00:06:24,764 --> 00:06:28,256
Well, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm in baseball.

85
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:31,132
Oh, I see.
Well, my husband's busy,

86
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:33,798
but perhaps you could talk
to my father first.

87
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:35,898
I'll call him.

88
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:38,637
Grandpa! Grandpa!

89
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:41,340
[Explosion]

90
00:06:41,414 --> 00:06:43,348
Did you call, Lily?

91
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,544
Grandpa, this is Mr. Dur...

92
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,180
Mr. Durocher?

93
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:52,281
Mr. Durocher?

94
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,751
Oh.

95
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:58,354
[Chuckles]
Leo Durocher!

96
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:01,491
You could have knocked me over
with a tombstone.

97
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:03,832
How do you do?
It's a pleasure.

98
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:07,703
You're one of the greatest sports figures
in the last 100 years.

99
00:07:07,774 --> 00:07:09,833
Thanks, but I'm not that old.

100
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:12,969
I guess it won't hurt
to disturb Herman.

101
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:16,311
Marilyn, would you call him?
Oh, well, certainly, Aunt Lily.

102
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:22,816
Uncle Herman, there's someone
up here to see you!

103
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,165
Ya big dummy!
Look what ya did.

104
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:42,402
That's Leo Durocher.
You scared him.
Me?

105
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:45,933
In that black suit,
he must have thought
you were an umpire.

106
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:50,649
Leo? Leo?

107
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:53,083
Wake up. Wake up!

108
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:56,054
I hope he's all right.
I don't like the way the color's
coming back into his face.

109
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:58,682
He was safe by a mile!
Don't tell me!

110
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:03,886
- Oh.
- Take it easy, Mr. Durocher.
You're among friends.

111
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:06,090
You gotta be kiddin'.

112
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,760
No, no, Mr. Durocher.

113
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:12,771
This is my son-in-law,
Herman Munster,
the one you came to see.

114
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:18,876
Were you at the park this morning
hitting some baseballs?

115
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:22,904
That's right. I was knocking
out a couple for my boy.

116
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:26,145
One of'em hit me on the head
eight blocks away.

117
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:28,949
Oh, you poor man.
That explains why...

118
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:31,490
you acted so strangely
when you came in.

119
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:33,856
Listen, Mr. Durocher,
if you plan to sue,

120
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:38,057
I can dig up 50 witnesses to prove
we never left Transylvania.

121
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:42,591
No, no, no.
I have a business proposition
for Mr. Munster.

122
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:46,435
And I wonder if I could
talk to you alone.

123
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,739
Certainly.
Uh, would you excuse us?

124
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,801
Of course, dear.

125
00:08:55,248 --> 00:08:58,581
In case you need me, Herman,
just give me a howl.

126
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:07,322
[Whispering]
I wonder what the business
proposition is, Aunt Lily.

127
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:11,090
I don't know, but the last time
a man talked to Herman alone,

128
00:09:11,164 --> 00:09:14,190
he wound up buying
a secondhand Edsel.

129
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:20,164
Say, uh, Herman,
have you ever played baseball before?

130
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,174
Uh, baseball?
Yeah.

131
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:24,767
Well, I've, uh... I've fooled around
a little with the game.

132
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:28,541
I, uh, played
a little second base.

133
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:33,081
Well, I can see that's where
you made your mistake.
Hmm?

134
00:09:33,152 --> 00:09:36,610
Well, you know when that runner's
on first coming down into second base...

135
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:38,623
to break up the double play?

136
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:41,489
You've gotta keep your face
outta the way of those spikes.

137
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:44,688
Oh, right.
I'll try to remember that.

138
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:47,494
Uh-huh. I'll say one thing, boy.

139
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:51,128
You're really built.
You're put together
like a ballplayer.

140
00:09:51,204 --> 00:09:53,172
Oh. Well, thank you.

141
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:55,400
That wasn't the plan.

142
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:57,807
I just came out that way.

143
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,814
Herman?
Hmm?

144
00:10:02,882 --> 00:10:06,511
Does Mr. Durocher really think
you could be a big baseball player?

145
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:10,955
That's right, Lily.
I'm going down to the baseball park
this morning and try out.

146
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:13,993
He says I've got it in the bag.
[Laughing]

147
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,554
Oh, boy, my dad
playing for the Dodgers.
Wait till I tell the other kids.

148
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:21,930
You know, that's great, Herman.
There's big money in baseball.

149
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:23,935
Oh, it's not just the money,
Grandpa.

150
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:26,494
What I'm looking forward to
is the fringe benefits.

151
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:30,736
I'll be able to endorse breakfast foods
and shave on television.

152
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,404
And I'll be able to sit in the audience
on the Ed Sullivan Show...

153
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:36,243
and have him mispronounce
my name and everything.

154
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:40,616
But, Uncle Herman,
what about your job at the parlor
and your career?

155
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:45,317
Yes, Herman. Mr. Gateman
has great plans for you down there.

156
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:49,054
And he's so proud of you,
and the way you carry
your share of the load.

157
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:52,757
That's true, dear.
Uh, that's very true.

Herman Munster
is at the crossroads.

160
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:04,133
Should I struggle along
at an old job...

161
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,873
for the promise of security
in the future?

162
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:12,384
Or should I grasp time
by the forelock,

163
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:16,650
and, on that great merry-go-round
of life, try for the brass ring?

to that ballpark this morning,

three strikes, you're out.

This is Mrs. Herman Munster.

Oh, good.

I didn't mean to get your day off
to a bad start.

I'm calling for my husband, Herman.

He won't be able to get
into the parlor today for work.

No, no, he's not sick.

179

He has an appointment downtown
with a Mr. Leo Durocher.

180
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:14,344
No, Mr. Durocher's not sick either.

181
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:17,872
But Herman will be glad
to give him one of your cards.

will be able to come in tomorrow.

Hey, Leo. Where's this great prospect
you were telling me about?

187

He's in the clubhouse getting
his uniform on. He'll be right out.
Hey, what's he like?

188
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:47,136
Well, he's no matinee idol.

it's a weird setup.

you can play second base.

Does it start early, huh?

302
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:05,372
I don't have a contract.
[Shouts]
What?

303
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:07,469
I don't start anywhere.
What?

304
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:09,537
They don't want me.

305
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:13,881
We almost made it.
Pop was signing autographs
for Don Drysdale and everything.

306
00:21:13,953 --> 00:21:17,252
Then Mr. Durocher made a phone call
and told us to go home.

307
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:19,985
Well, what happened,
Uncle Herman?

308
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:23,586
Well, Mr. Durocher called
Mr. O'Malley of the Dodgers
and told him what I did,

309
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:27,063
and then he hung up
with a long look on his face.

310
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:29,362
Yeah, he said the way Pop batted
the ball around...

311
00:21:29,435 --> 00:21:33,030
and knocked over the scoreboard
and everything, he'd ruin the field.

312
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:36,506
Mr. O'Malley said
it would cost him $75,000...

313
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:39,601
to put the Dodger Stadium
back in shape every time I played.

314
00:21:39,678 --> 00:21:42,613
Ooh, what a catastrophe!

315
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:46,913
And they said the insurance companies
wouldn't allow the players
on the same field with me.

316
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:49,853
Herman, I didn't want you to do it,

317
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:54,120
but just the same,
I know how badly you must feel.

318
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:57,458
You know, Lily,
I'm all washed up in sports.

319
00:21:57,529 --> 00:21:59,463
I'm a has-been.

320
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:01,522
Oh, don't worry, Pop.

321
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,034
You can always play baseball
with me in the park.

322
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:06,469
- Thank you, Eddie.
- Yes, Uncle Herman.

323
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:08,972
And I need you around
to help me do my homework.

324
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,976
- Thank you, Marilyn.
- And, Herman,

325
00:22:12,044 --> 00:22:14,774
don't feel badly on my account.

326
00:22:14,847 --> 00:22:17,816
So I won't make a million dollars
sponging off you.

327
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:19,976
I can learn to live with it.

328
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:22,714
Thank you, Grandpa.
That's very touching.

329
00:22:22,788 --> 00:22:26,155
Herman, you must realize...

330
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:29,388
how much we all love you
and need you,

331
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:31,395
each in our own way.

332
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:33,658
And I, most of all.

333
00:22:33,732 --> 00:22:36,030
[Sniffles]
Thank you, Lily.

334
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:43,541
Now look what you've gone
and made me do.

335
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:48,205
I haven't cried like this since
they canceled Kukla, Fran and Ollie.

336
00:22:49,982 --> 00:22:52,280
[Sobbing]

337
00:23:05,864 --> 00:23:08,128
Grandpa, are you down here?

338
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,294
I'm in here watching television.!

339
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,100
[Man Chattering On TV]

340
00:23:15,374 --> 00:23:18,275
Where's Herman and Eddie?
They went to the park.

341
00:23:18,343 --> 00:23:20,504
Oh, not baseball again.

342
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:23,571
No, I think they took
the football with them this time.

343
00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:25,640
Herman's always been great
at sports.

344
00:23:25,718 --> 00:23:29,484
Remember back in Transylvania
when he was a cross-country runner?

345
00:23:29,555 --> 00:23:31,648
Oh, he had quite a following.

346
00:23:31,724 --> 00:23:34,989
Crowds used to run after him
yelling and screaming.

347
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,994
What are you watching?

348
00:23:37,062 --> 00:23:38,893
[Grandpa]
It's a cooking show.

349
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:41,956
They're gonna give a recipe
for an upside-down cake.

350
00:23:46,805 --> 00:23:49,137
Uh, 6, 23,

351
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,836
14, 8, 10,

352
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,368
uh, uh, uh, 11, 12.

353
00:23:55,447 --> 00:23:57,438
Hup!

354
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:13,029
Thanks very much for the lunch.
It was very enjoyable, Charlie.

355
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:15,032
Elroy, as general manager
of the Rams,

356
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,933
I suppose you look forward
to a real top season.

357
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:21,097
Yes, I think we're strong
in every department.

358
00:24:21,173 --> 00:24:23,403
But I'm a little worried
about our punting.
[Ball Descending Rapidly]

359
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,974
I got you.
Elroy, are you all right?

360
00:24:28,046 --> 00:24:30,537
Yeah, I'm all right, but...

361
00:24:30,616 --> 00:24:32,675
tell me, is there
a football field around here?

362
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:35,549
No. The closest one
is eight blocks away.

363
00:24:35,621 --> 00:24:39,921
Eight blocks?
I think I might have the answer
to our kicking problem.

364
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:42,392
Mr. Hirsch.! Take my advice.

365
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:45,225
Forget it... if you don't wanna
wind up going out of your skull.
