Thank you, dear.

I just opened the window.

we've seen you there
lots of times before.

Oh, so now
you're ashamed of me.

have to be ashamed of this poor,
broken-down old man anymore.

Yes, dear?
I'm worried.

We wouldn't want Grandpa
really to leave.

Now, Lily, believe me...
there's nothing to worry
your pretty head about.

41
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:17,562
Oh, what with the mood he's in,
there's no telling what he might do.

42
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:21,164
Last time we had a family spat,
he turned himself into a frog...

and lived under the porch
for weeks.

Yes, and I've never seen him happier.

He could croak every night.

a little bit worried?

Gee, Grandpa,
can I go to the cemetery with ya?

do you, Grandpa?

cashed in his chips.

knew you were leaving,
they wouldn't want you to go.

Yes, and you don't see them
stopping me, do you?

whether I go away or not.

[Snarling]

309
00:22:10,776 --> 00:22:12,971
That Grandpa... what a ham.

[Cheering, Whistling]

312
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:25,880
[Man]
More.! More.! More.! More.!

313
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:31,725
You were just great, Count. I want
to apologize for all those things I said.
[Woman, Grandpa Chattering]

314
00:22:31,797 --> 00:22:36,166
Now, look, Count,
I want to give you a contract,
and you can write your own ticket.

315
00:22:36,235 --> 00:22:38,601
I'll double your salary,
book you all through the East.

316
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:40,605
I got friends back there
who'll take care of you.

317
00:22:40,673 --> 00:22:44,973
In the East!
Oh, I haven't flown there in years.

318
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:48,377
Come on, Lily.
Oh, Herman.

319
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:52,144
[Crying]
We've lost Grandpa for good.
[Sighs]

320
00:22:53,886 --> 00:22:56,980
Thank you,
but I have another booking.

321
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:03,991
This one is with my family.

322
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:07,328
Oh! Welcome back, Grandpa.

323
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:10,835
But, pops, show business
needs performers like you.

324
00:23:10,903 --> 00:23:14,236
I know that,
but I found one thing
out there tonight.

325
00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:17,935
I need my family more
than show business needs me.

326
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,944
Oh!

327
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:30,783
Boy, there's a real
showbiz family for ya.

328
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:33,757
They even go home
with their makeup on.

329
00:23:38,363 --> 00:23:41,730
Grandpa, I hope I didn't
ruin your act for you.

330
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,734
I was just trying to be helpful.

331
00:23:43,802 --> 00:23:47,033
Oh, I was never in any trouble,
but thanks anyway.

332
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:50,075
It shows that your heart
is in the right place.

333
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:53,168
Oh, oh...
Oh, always has been.
[Chuckles]

334
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:57,807
Grandpa, are you sure you could
have gotten out of that trunk
all by yourself?

335
00:23:57,883 --> 00:24:02,047
Of course, Lily.
I was only toying with the audience.

336
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:04,055
Of course he was.
Hmm.

337
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:07,524
Oh, it sure is wonderful
to be back with my family,

338
00:24:07,593 --> 00:24:10,619
especially at this time of the year.

339
00:24:10,696 --> 00:24:14,632
[Marilyn, Herman]
Oh!
My favorite holiday dish...

340
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,794
plum pudding
soaked in brandy sauce.

341
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,567
Here. Here, let me
light it for you.
Come on! Come on!

342
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,167
W-W-Wait a minute.
What's going on here anyway?

343
00:24:25,244 --> 00:24:28,736
What do you think,
I'm a helpless old man?

344
00:24:28,814 --> 00:24:31,044
