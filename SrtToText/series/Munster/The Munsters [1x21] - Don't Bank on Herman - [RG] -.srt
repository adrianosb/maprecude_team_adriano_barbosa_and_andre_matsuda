1
00:00:05,052 --> 00:00:09,182
Lily, don't you think Marilyn
should be up in bed?

2
00:00:09,256 --> 00:00:13,750
I mean, she looks terrible...
with all that color in her cheeks
and everything.

3
00:00:13,827 --> 00:00:16,796
She was sent home from school
about an hour ago.

4
00:00:17,998 --> 00:00:22,833
Oh! She has a fever... 98.6.

5
00:00:22,903 --> 00:00:24,894
But... But isn't that normal, Aunt Lily?

6
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:28,907
Oh, heavens, no.
Uh, we Munsters average
in the low 50s.

7
00:00:30,977 --> 00:00:32,968
Hey, Dad.

8
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:35,981
Grandpa's down in the dungeon
waiting to mix up a cure.

9
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:38,040
Here.

10
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:50,123
Grandpa, now hear this.

11
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:52,529
I read you, Herman.

12
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:54,567
High fever.

13
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:57,000
High fever.

14
00:00:59,106 --> 00:01:02,837
And I feel so low.

15
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:05,673
Feels very low.
Feels very low.

16
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,175
Feels very low.

17
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:11,240
Feels very low.

18
00:01:14,654 --> 00:01:17,487
There.
[Chuckles]
That oughta lift her spirits.

19
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,728
Oh. Tell him to forget it.

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,427
Tell him to forget it.

21
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:31,062
Grandpa, forget it.

22
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,631
Oh.

23
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:41,771
Oh, I guess you're right
about Grandpa's cures.

24
00:01:41,848 --> 00:01:46,251
He should either give up medicine
or take up practice in California.

25
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,186
Oh, you poor dear.

26
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:53,590
We'd better put her upstairs in bed
before Grandpa has her floating
all over the neighborhood.

27
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,924
Can I help you, Lily?
Oh, no, thank you, dear.

28
00:01:55,996 --> 00:01:58,965
Oh, yes.
Uh... Uh, maybe.

29
00:01:59,032 --> 00:02:01,364
Uh, Marilyn was going
to the bank for me.

30
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:04,268
Do you think I could trust you
to make a withdrawal?

31
00:02:04,337 --> 00:02:06,271
Trust me?

32
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:10,275
How could a levelheaded,
conscientious fellow like me
get in trouble at the bank?

33
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,079
Oh, Herman, here's the bankbook.

34
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,345
It's just a simple withdrawal.
Yes, dear.

35
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:30,378
Uh, but I think you'd better
take Grandpa to the bank with you.

36
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:35,224
Hmm. Well, I would prefer
to make a withdrawal
at the blood bank,

37
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:38,059
but I guess you can't
have everything.

38
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:40,190
Now, Herman,
Yes, dear.

39
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:43,031
The withdrawal slip is all made out.
Mm-hmm.

40
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:45,571
We have
a tax installment due...
Right.

41
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,767
So we need all the money
from the tax account.

42
00:03:48,842 --> 00:03:52,278
Right. Uh, draw out
all the money.

43
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:55,178
Yes.
Uh, my hat, please.

44
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:59,610
Thank you.
And, Herman...

45
00:03:59,686 --> 00:04:02,553
Yes, dear?
Bring it straight back here.

46
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:04,613
[Chuckles Softly]

47
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,954
Gotcha. Grandpa.

48
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:24,672
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Grover?
Yes, Williams.

49
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:28,612
I just had another report
on those masked bandits who've been
terrorizing this side of town.

50
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:32,345
They held up our main office
this morning. We may be next.

51
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:34,250
They the ones
with the Halloween masks?

52
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:36,585
Yes, those hideous disguises
are their trademark.

53
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:41,753
I'll warn all my tellers, sir.
Okay, but these men are always heavily armed,
and I don't want anybody hurt.

54
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:46,891
You know my rule here.
If this bank is held up,
you tell our people to turn over the money.

55
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:50,198
That's much better than having
one of our personnel
or our customers shot.

56
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,966
Okay, Mr. Grover.
I'll inform the tellers.

57
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:16,961
Excuse me, miss.
Yes, sir? May I help...

58
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:20,793
[Gasps]
I'd like all the money.

59
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:31,808
Uh, miss, would you
put it in a bag or something?

60
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:34,312
It... It's hard to carry
loose like that.

61
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:47,890
Oh, thank you, miss.
Uh, you give very quick service.

62
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:49,986
It's a pleasure doing business
with you.

63
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:00,796
Bye.

64
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:11,146
You know, Herman,
I didn't realize Lily had
that much money in her tax account.

65
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,252
I know. As the hipsters say,

66
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:17,346
that's quite a bagful of bread.

67
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:22,127
Maybe you oughta count it
while we're waiting for Lily.

68
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:24,186
Count it?

69
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:26,596
Good idea.

70
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,964
Good idea.

71
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:31,026
They might have robbed us.

72
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:41,078
18,100.

73
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:44,306
18,200.

74
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:49,713
$18,300.

75
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,350
Herman, I have some news for you.
Yes, dear?

76
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,564
We only had $680
in our tax account.

77
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,760
Really?
Really.

78
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,102
You know what this means,
now, don't you?

79
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:08,732
Yes, I do, dear.

80
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:11,675
It means our bank gives
a very generous rate of interest.

81
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:15,203
It means, Herman,
that you have goofed it again.

82
00:07:16,549 --> 00:07:19,177
But, Lily, "goofed it"?

83
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:21,311
What do you mean I goofed it?

84
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:24,322
What happened?
Oh!

85
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,086
Don't you "But, Lily" me.

86
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,152
All right. I'll tell you
exactly what happened.

87
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:35,258
This afternoon, a certain party
went to the bank...

88
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:40,295
with a bankbook showing $680
in the account, hmm?

89
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:46,039
Mm-hmm.
And a withdrawal slip
made out for $680.

90
00:07:46,112 --> 00:07:48,103
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.

91
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:51,514
Now, what did
this certain party do?

92
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:54,576
Did he come home with $680?

93
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:56,986
No, he did not.

94
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:59,581
This featherbrained klutz
came home...

95
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:03,755
with $18,300
that didn't belong to him.

96
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,025
That's what he did.

97
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:10,502
Now, what would you
have to say to that?

98
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,266
I would say that was
a remarkable coincidence.

99
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:16,206
Because, you know,
the same thing happened to me.

100
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:18,642
Herman.
Hmm?

101
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:22,442
You are the featherbrained klutz
to whom I was referring.

102
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:28,276
Oh. Oh, l... l... I was?

103
00:08:28,354 --> 00:08:30,948
I mean, you were?
I mean...

104
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:33,686
Oh. Well, golly, Lily.

105
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,092
You don't have to
put all the blame on me.

106
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:39,893
L... I mean, your own father
was along with me, you know.

107
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:42,196
And he's not half as big a...

108
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:45,032
uh, what... what you said as I am.

109
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:47,834
And anyway,
when the lady at the bank
gave us all that money,

110
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:50,034
I couldn't just start
counting it right there,

111
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:52,509
'cause she might have thought
I didn't trust her.

112
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:55,639
Then she might have
gotten angry at me,

113
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:58,947
started yelling and everything.

114
00:09:02,388 --> 00:09:05,186
Well... l-I'm sorry, dear.

115
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:08,625
I guess it wasn't all your fault.

116
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:12,529
I don't know how it happened,
but I do know one thing.

117
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:16,399
You've just got to take that money
back to the bank tomorrow.

118
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:19,927
I mean, it's... it's only
the fair, adult thing to do.

119
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:23,498
Isn't it, sweetheart?
I guess so.

120
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:26,170
Then you're not mad at me anymore?

121
00:09:26,246 --> 00:09:28,976
How could I stay mad
at you, pussycat?

122
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:45,660
What are you doing?

123
00:09:45,732 --> 00:09:48,599
Uh, uh, I've never seen
this much money before.

124
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:51,831
Can't I just play with it
till I have to give it back?

125
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:53,896
Oh, Herman!

126
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:02,404
18,100.

127
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,074
18,200.

128
00:10:06,152 --> 00:10:08,279
$18,300.

129
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:13,689
[Chuckles]
Money, money.
Money, money.

130
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,092
[Sighs]
Money.

131
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:19,689
My good man, I'll take
that black limousine and two of
those red convertibles, please.

132
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:22,234
Thank you.
[Chuckles]

133
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:24,770
Money.

134
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:26,828
[Laughing]

135
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:31,800
Please, girls,
stop kissing me. Stop.

136
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:35,473
Just because I gave you
a few diamond necklaces,
doesn't mean you own me.

137
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,544
Zsa Zsa, no.
You'll have to stand in line
like the rest.

138
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:43,979
I'm rolling in money.

139
00:10:45,658 --> 00:10:47,785
I'm swimming in money.

140
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,055
I'm drowning in money.

141
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:54,657
Drowning.
Drowning.

142
00:10:54,734 --> 00:10:57,760
Drowning.
All right, drown.

143
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:02,499
Help! Help!
I'm drowning.

144
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:05,510
You can't let me drown.
I'm a rich man.

145
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:07,569
Help!

146
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,275
Are you quite through, Mr. Rockefeller?

147
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:15,980
Oh, it's you, Lily.
I was dreaming.

148
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:18,114
[Sighs]
I thought I was a rich man.

149
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:22,685
Well, you're not.
So will you please send Zsa Zsa home
and let's get some sleep.

150
00:11:22,762 --> 00:11:24,730
Zsa Zsa?

151
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:29,894
Lily, I know I won't be able to sleep
till that money's back in the bank.
Oh, of course you will.

152
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:33,336
And you'll take it back in the morning
as soon as the bank is open.

153
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:35,931
Now good night.
I'm just dead.

154
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:46,541
[Huffing]

155

00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:35,892
Fingers, when we blow this door off,

305
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:39,301
you just ain't gonna believe
what's inside.

306
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:41,396
Light it.

307
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:55,111
Grandpa, it got quiet
out there.

308
00:22:56,121 --> 00:22:58,180
You don't suppose
they've given up?

309
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:01,158
[Laughs]
Don't be ridiculous, Herman.

310
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:03,717
They must have stopped
to have a cigarette or something.

311
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:06,890
I'm sure we'll be hearing a noise
any minute now.

312
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:13,995
[Explosion]

313
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:27,711
Hi!
Herman, these are the ones
who did it.

314
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:32,954
Oh, Grandpa,
I feel so good,
I'm gonna give 'em a big hug.

315
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:35,016
[Chuckling]

316
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:45,702
I think we better get out of here
before somebody shows up.

317
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:47,762
They don't look like police to me.

318
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,774
[Mouthing Words]

319
00:23:51,777 --> 00:23:54,245
[Mouthing Words]

320
00:23:54,313 --> 00:23:56,543
Read some more
about the bank robbers, Grandpa.

321
00:23:56,615 --> 00:23:59,641
Well, "Scotty Malone
and Fingers Dusick...

322
00:23:59,718 --> 00:24:03,518
"upon being revived by police
at the scene of the attempted robbery...

323
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:07,525
"blamed their capture
on two unidentified citizens...

324
00:24:07,593 --> 00:24:11,154
who appeared from nowhere
and rendered them unconscious."

325
00:24:12,164 --> 00:24:15,031
Oh, how brave of you, Herman.

326
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,625
"Now, these are thought to be
the same persons...

327
00:24:17,703 --> 00:24:21,662
who summoned the police
on the bank's alarm system."

328
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,734
And it says a reward is waiting
if the two men come forward.
Are you gonna claim it, Herman?

329
00:24:26,812 --> 00:24:29,542
Oh, I don't really think so, Lily.

330
00:24:29,615 --> 00:24:31,674
It would mean interviews
and photographs,

331
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,743
and you know how shy I am
about having my picture taken.
