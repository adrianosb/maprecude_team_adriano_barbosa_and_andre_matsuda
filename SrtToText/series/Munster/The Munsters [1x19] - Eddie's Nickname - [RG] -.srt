Uh, I don't know, Lily.
I just got home myself.

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,428
I had to stay a little late at the parlor
and lay out some things for the boss.

4
00:00:17,497 --> 00:00:20,955
Well, I'm about to fix supper,
and I want to ask him about dessert.

00:00:21,034 --> 00:00:23,332
So, let me know
when Eddie comes in.

00:00:24,504 --> 00:00:28,770
- Hmm?
- I said, will you let me know
when Eddie comes home?

I think Eddie's home from school.

21
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:31,728
But, Herman, if Eddie said all those things
about being through with school,
there must be a reason.

00:02:31,798 --> 00:02:35,632
Didn't you even ask him?
Well, maybe they just
sent him home.

Some of the kids used to put
the girls' pigtails in the inkwells.

Did you ask him why he was
so definite about quitting school?

Well, no.

I just didn't get around to it.

Oh, Herman, you make me so angry.

Now, I want you
to go upstairs right now...

But wouldn't it be better
if Eddie came down here,

38
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:26,377
so I could sort of
lean on the mantel
while we talk man-to-man?

why you said all those things
about quitting school.

Well, then, how come
you didn't say anything
when I came home?

All you did was sit there
and read your old newspaper.

Eddie, your father's a very busy man,

that when I come home,

That is not the point.

The point is I came up here
to find out why you've suddenly
turned against school.

69
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:28,969
It's just that I can't go back there
ever again on account of
what happened today.

you can tell old Dad.

the kids made up a nickname for me.

- They called you a nickname?

could anyone think of
to call you?

Wherever I went, some kid popped up
and called me... Oh.

- Called you what?
- I can't say it.

even to my own father.

Eddie, as your father,
I demand to be told.

- It's... It's Shorty.

Yeah.

do you know what
a very wise man once said?

00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:25,193
What?
He said,

85
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:29,668
"Sticks and stones
can break my bones,
but names can never hurt me."

That's because nobody
ever called him Shorty.

Why can't I be big and tall like my hero?

I know you've had
a talk with Eddie,

102
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:35,024
but I don't think
we should allow our child
to be tormented in school any longer.

103
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:38,628
I feel that we should complain to
the teacher, the principal...

104
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:40,969
and, if necessary,
to the Board of Education.

Why go through
all this red tape...

106
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,310
when I can solve this problem
with a plain, old-fashioned spelling bee?

107
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,247
What's a "plain, old-fashioned"
spelling bee?

108
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:52,648

109
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:57,349

who call Eddie "Shorty"
to a free party,

110
00:07:57,423 --> 00:08:02,053
and then, when they get here,
I cast a spell over them
and turn them into kangaroos.

111
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:04,926
Gee, that sounds great, Grandpa!
Will you do it?

112
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:07,967
No. Grandpa will do
no such thing.

113
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:13,301
That's right, Grandpa. I'm sure
if there's one thing Eddie doesn't need
it's your broken-down magic.

114
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:14,965
Ha!
Gee, Dad,

how am I gonna face
the other kids in school tomorrow?

116
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,578
They're still gonna call me Shorty.

117
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:23,309
Eddie, I'm sure it's strictly
a psychological problem.

118
00:08:23,383 --> 00:08:28,844
And I'm sure that you can overcome it
with the proper psychological attitude.

119
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:32,824
In other words,
plant both feet
firmly on the ground...

I'll try, Pop.

122
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,864

It's okay to have your feet
firmly planted on the ground, Eddie,

123
00:08:42,936 --> 00:08:46,633
but if you keep your chin up that high,
you're a sucker for a left hook.

Oh, sorry, Grandpa.
Shh. Not so loud.

That's pretty good.

Now, keep your hands up high
and your weight evenly balanced.

129
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:05,147
Now should I try to hit you?

130
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:08,388
Oh, not yet. I have to
work out a plan of strategy for you.

131
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:11,862
Now, we'll pretend
that I'm one of your classmates...

in a school yard waiting to fight...

133

because I called you Shorty.

134
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:21,630
And just as we're ready to go,
you point behind me and say,
"Hold it. A teacher is coming."

135
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:25,337

- You're telling me.
- But isn't that fighting dirty?

141
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,093
Only if you use it
against girls.

Not "my father."
"A teacher is coming."

right now.

boxing gloves?

they came from.
Yeah. Me too.

151
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,601
Grandpa, get 'em off.

152
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:27,762
I am really disappointed in you.

153
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,506
Imagine. A grandfather
training his own grandson
in brutality.

154
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:37,106
But we didn't even get to brutality.
I was just starting...
Grandpa,

155
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:41,415
I said no violence,
and I mean no violence.

156
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:48,417
Hmm.

157
00:10:51,698 --> 00:10:53,723
You know, Eddie,
I love him,

158
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,031
but there are times
I'd like to bite him
right in the throat.

159
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:01,266
Good night, Grandpa.
You're going to bed?

160
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:06,540
I have to get plenty of rest so I'll have
enough energy to cry all day tomorrow
when the kids call me Shorty.

161
00:11:06,612 --> 00:11:08,773
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Come back.

162
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:12,249
[Chuckles]
You won't have to cry
all day tomorrow.

163
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:16,277
As a matter of fact,
you'll never have to cry again
because somebody calls you Shorty.

164
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:18,290
Why not?
Why not?
[Laughs]

165
00:11:18,358 --> 00:11:24,126
Because your adoring grandpa
is gonna give you a magic potion that
will make you grow six inches overnight.

166
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:26,358
Six inches?
Maybe seven.

167
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:28,297
Did you ever use it before?

168
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:33,431
Did I ever try it before?
I once gave it to a pirate
friend of mine who was only five feet tall.

169
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:37,306
- Did it work?
- "Did it work"? Didn't you ever
hear of Long John Silver?

170
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:41,245
It's what is known in the trade
as a magic milk shake.

171
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:49,013
Six inches? Overnight?
Yeah. Six inches.

172
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:52,455
And when you wake up
tomorrow morning,
you look in the mirror,

173
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:55,460
you'll see the tallest boy
in the class.

174
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:57,519
Bottoms up.

175
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:06,404
Good, good.
Now, nighty-night
and sleep tight.

176
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:32,195
[Herman]
Lily, today is a school day.
The child belongs in school.

177
00:12:32,265 --> 00:12:34,256
[Lily]
With a beard?

178
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, Uncle Herman,
you can't expect Eddie
to go to school...

179
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:42,041
when he looks so different
from all the other kids.

180
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:44,633
Eddie...
Herman, Herman.
Speak gently.

181
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,178
He's in a state of shock.

182
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:54,116
Eddie,

183
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,747
uh, come upstairs.

184
00:12:56,823 --> 00:12:58,620
I'll give you a quick shave.

185
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:02,084
It won't help.

186
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:07,429
That's funny.
I thought I heard a noise.

187
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,060
It was me.
I said it won't help.

188
00:13:10,136 --> 00:13:12,502
I heard it again.

189
00:13:12,572 --> 00:13:15,370
I think it's coming from
that chair.

190
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:17,432
Hmm.

191
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:22,305
I can't understand it.
Nobody's sitting here.

192
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:26,875
Oh, come on, Herman.
Knock it off. Will you stop
with the silent treatment?

193
00:13:26,953 --> 00:13:28,887
Why won't a shave help?

194
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:31,116
Well, at the rate
Eddie grows whiskers,

195
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,715
he'll have five-o'clock shadow
by 9:00 a.m.

196
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:37,661
And whose fault is that?
He spoke to me!
He spoke to me! He did!

197
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,255
[Laughs]
My daughter's husband
spoke to me. See?

198
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,494
I want you two
to stop fighting.

199
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:45,366
Now... Now you make up
and bury the shovel.

200
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:47,429
I said I was sorry, didn't I?

201
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:52,103
Oh, Grandpa,
sometimes saying "I'm sorry"
just isn't enough.

202
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:54,510
Amen.

203
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,514
Some magic milk shake.

204
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:59,608
Well, how was I to know
I had inferior ingredients?

205
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:02,085
Now he's blaming it
on the ingredients.

206
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:04,521
That's right.
It must have been the he-frog.

207
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:09,254
The what?
The he-frog,
as distinguished from the she-frog.

208
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:12,764
You see, the recipe called for
the powdered shinbone of a he-frog.

209
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:15,767
Only they just don't make 'em
the way they used to.

210
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:18,463
I should have saved that one
from the 15th century.

211
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:22,440
Boy, those he-frogs
from the 15th century,
they were terrific.

212
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:24,533
I remember once
I said to Queen Isabella...

213
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,135
- Eddie, don't scratch it.
- But it itches.

214
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:29,875
I think there's a hunk of bacon
in there from breakfast.

215
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:32,884
I don't care.
Don't scratch it.

216
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:36,285
Mommy will run
the vacuum cleaner through it later.

217
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:39,552
Herman, Eddie should
see a doctor immediately.

218
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,923
Uh, I agree.

219
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:45,293
Why don't you take him down
to see our family doctor...
Dr. Dudley.

220
00:14:45,364 --> 00:14:48,094
No. No.
I think you should take him.

221
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:52,729
After all, you are the boy's father,
and it's a very serious problem.

222
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:54,739
I still wish you'd take him.

223
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:56,172
Why?

224
00:14:57,243 --> 00:15:02,510
Because if I walk down the street
with a boy wearing a beard,
everybody's gonna stare at me. That's why.

225
00:15:02,582 --> 00:15:04,777
Oh, nonsense.

226
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,751
The least you could do
would be to phone the parlor,

227
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,687
ask for the morning off
to take your son to the doctor.

228
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:12,690
[Chuckles]
That's true, Herman.

229
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:16,023
And I have a clever idea
how to disguise Eddie...

230
00:15:16,095 --> 00:15:18,928
so you won't be embarrassed
when you walk down the street.

231
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:22,195
Oh, Grandpa, don't try
any more of your magic on him.

232
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:25,237
No, Grandpa.
Don't you try turning him
into anything.

233
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:29,104
I have no intention
of hopping across town
with a bearded kangaroo.

234
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:31,643
Don't you worry, Herman.

235
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:33,702
Eddie, come with me.

236
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:37,873
Eddie, you know who
you look like?

237
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,941
Who?
Mitch Miller.

238
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,647
[Wails]
I'm sorry, Eddie. I'm sorry.

239
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:45,213
I was only kidding.
Come on. I'm sorry.

240
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:58,160
Oh. All right, Miss Fairchild,
next patient.

241
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:01,571
Are you emotionally prepared?

242
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:03,700
E-Emotionally prepared for what?

243
00:16:03,776 --> 00:16:05,403
Mr. Herman Munster.

244
00:16:05,478 --> 00:16:07,469
Oh, no.

245
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:12,313
I'll never forget the last house call
I made there.

246
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:15,411
I was writing out an order
for an autopsy...

247
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:19,822
when Mr. Munster
double-crossed me
and sat up in bed.

248
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:22,656
Well, today we have
Mr. Herman Munster and son.

249
00:16:22,728 --> 00:16:24,889
And son?

250
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:28,092
Mr. Munster had the guts
to become a father?

251
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,158
Apparently.

252
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:33,296
Do they, uh, look alike?

253
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:36,466
No. The little boy
is much shorter.

254
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:40,308
That's not what I meant.
Do they look alike in...

255
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:43,371
well, for lack of a better word,
the face?

256
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:46,441
Why don't you peek
in the waiting room
and see for yourself?

257
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,510
All righty. I will.

258
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:07,128
Oh, no.

259
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:09,766
Mr. Munster's face is bad enough.

260
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:14,336
Imagine what his son's
must look like if he has to
cover it with a paper bag.

261
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:17,539
Shall I show them in now?

262
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:21,245
Yes, but you better have
Miss Hansen stand by
with an anesthetic.

263
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,448
For the patient?
No. For me.

264
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:46,336
Oh, uh...

265
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:48,812
Uh, good day, Dr. Dudley.

266
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:50,906
Good day, Mr. Munster.

267
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:53,315
And what, uh...
[Chuckles]

268
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:56,184
I mean, uh,
who have we here?

269
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:58,246
Uh, this is my son, Dr. Dudley.

270
00:17:58,324 --> 00:18:02,658
[Chuckles]
And, uh, what's your name,
little man?

271
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:04,992
[Muffled]
Edward Wolfgang Munster.

272
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:07,931
[Chuckles]
Pardon me, I didn't quite get it.

273
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,696
Uh, Edward Wolfgang Munster.

274
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,399
Oh. Uh, will you, uh,
please both be seated?

275
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:16,464
Oh, thank you.

276
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:28,313
[Sighs]
Okay, Eddie.

277
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:31,049
We're gonna let the doctor
see your face.

278
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:44,894
How old is little
Eddie Wolfgang again,
Mr. Munster?

279
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,064
He's 10.
Ten.

280
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,131
Excuse me just a minute.

281
00:19:01,954 --> 00:19:05,014
All righty.
Shall we have a go at it again?

282
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:12,892
Oh, my goodness.

283
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:16,958
Has he had it since birth?

284
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,703
Uh, the head?
Oh. Oh, yes. That's the original.

285
00:19:21,774 --> 00:19:23,799
The beard.

286
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:26,811
Oh. Uh, only since this morning.

287
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:31,179
His grandfather gave him
a frog-leg cocktail yesterday...

288
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,241
to make him grow,

289
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:35,549
but it just grew a beard.

290
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:39,380
Excuse me just a minute.

291
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:04,081
You want a snap diagnosis?

292
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:06,583
Will a snap cure go with it?
Yes.

293
00:20:06,652 --> 00:20:10,247
- Shoot.
- Edward Wolfgang's beard...

294
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:15,056
is the result of a certain
metabolic imbalance,

295
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:18,119
induced by what appear to be...

296
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:22,600
metaphysical or esoteric stimuli...

297
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:26,864
unknown to present-day medicine.

298
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,101
I see.
And the cure?

299
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:32,473
Lay in a big supply...

300
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:34,536
of paper bags.

301
00:20:39,118 --> 00:20:42,815
Eddie, don't get your beard
in your soup.

302
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:46,987
- Uncle Herman.
- What?

303
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:50,426
- Didn't Dr. Dudley
say anything constructive?
- No.

304
00:20:51,697 --> 00:20:54,461
When I rejected
the paper bag theory,

305
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:58,833
he suggested
that Eddie get used to
a new nickname... Fuzzy.

306
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:01,963
That's even worse than Shorty.

307
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,236
We all know
who we have to thank for that.

308
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:08,337
For your information, Herman,
I'm gonna make it up to him.

309
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:10,974
- How?
- I'm gonna make him my partner.

310
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,781
- A partner in what?
- Well, you remember that potion
that Eddie drank?

311
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:17,583
How could we forget it?
I'm gonna mass-produce it...

312
00:21:17,656 --> 00:21:21,717
and sell it at three dollars a bottle
as a sure cure for baldness.

313
00:21:23,162 --> 00:21:26,029
Eddie, Eddie, sit up straight.

314
00:21:26,098 --> 00:21:28,965
I'll make a fortune,
and I'll split with him 60-40.

315
00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:30,934
What's the matter with 50-50?

316
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:34,700
You want me to split 50-50
with a 10-year-old kid?

317
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:38,641
- Grandpa, I don't want you
to do anything. Just...
- Eddie, be careful.

318
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:44,976
Look!

319
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:49,881
- What happened?
- Well, the soup's disintegrated
Eddie's beard.

320
00:21:49,955 --> 00:21:53,152
She's right.
Dunk it again.

321
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:56,490
No. No.
Don't move.

322
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:11,633
Look.! The... The beard's gone.

323
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,701
[Sighs]
Thank goodness.

324
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:17,909
I wouldn't want to
go through life with a son
who looked like General Grant.

325
00:22:17,983 --> 00:22:20,884
There goes my surefire cure
for baldness.

326
00:22:20,953 --> 00:22:24,081
- Is it really gone?
- Look in the mirror and see.

327
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,293
Yippee!
[Laughs]

328
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:34,697
Well, I don't know
how this reflects on my cooking,
but... my child comes first.

329
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:37,600
[Herman]
Uh... Uh, Lily, Eddie.

330
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,865
Please, sit down.

331
00:22:40,939 --> 00:22:43,772
- Eddie.
- Yes, sir.

332
00:22:43,842 --> 00:22:46,037
Now that your problem is solved,

333
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:48,102
have you learned a lesson?

334
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,671
- I think so.
- What?

335
00:22:50,749 --> 00:22:53,775
I'll never tell Mom I don't like
her homemade soup again.

336
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,782
- That's not what I had in mind.
- It isn't?

337
00:22:57,856 --> 00:23:02,225
The lesson I want you to learn
is it doesn't matter what you look like.

338
00:23:02,294 --> 00:23:05,263
You can be tall or short...

339
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:08,493
or fat or thin or ugly...

340
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:11,536
or handsome,
like your father,

341
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:14,834
or you can be black
or yellow or white...

342
00:23:14,907 --> 00:23:16,898
it doesn't matter.

343
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:20,206
What does matter
is the size of your heart...

344
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:22,270
and the strength
of your character.

345
00:23:23,782 --> 00:23:26,876
Eddie, do you understand
what your father means?

346
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:29,750
- Mmm.
- Well, now, Eddie,

347
00:23:29,822 --> 00:23:33,087
now that you've solved
one of the little problems
of growing up,

348
00:23:33,158 --> 00:23:35,149
let's get on with our meal.

349
00:23:47,306 --> 00:23:50,605
Herman, you know something?

350
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:52,667
What, Grandpa?
You're all right.

351
00:23:54,012 --> 00:23:57,106
You aren't perfect,
but you're all right.

352
00:23:58,117 --> 00:24:00,108
Thank you.

353
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:11,829
Hello, Lily, dear.
Hello, Herman, dear.

354
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:15,526
Herman, you've gotta
talk to Eddie.
Yes, he's up in his room crying.

355
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:17,398
What happened today?

356
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,600
Well, he was playing baseball
with some other boys
in the neighborhood,

357
00:24:22,674 --> 00:24:26,440
and he struck out
with two out and the bases loaded.

358
00:24:26,512 --> 00:24:29,106
Poor kid.
He must feel awful.

359
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:31,172
Um, I'll go upstairs and talk to him.

360
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:35,778
Herman, Lily,
I've got an idea
that can solve this whole problem.

361
00:24:35,854 --> 00:24:38,414
What? What?
If I could get ahold of a bat...

362
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,288
a baseball bat once used
by Stan "The Man" Musial...

363
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,423
I could take it down into the lab,
crush it into a fine powder,
so he would be able to digest it.

364
00:24:46,498 --> 00:24:48,489
I remember once saying to...
