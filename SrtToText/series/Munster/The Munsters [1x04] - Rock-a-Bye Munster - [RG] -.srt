00:00:02,316 --> 00:00:05,547
[Man]
Gentlemen, shall we
begin the operation?

2
00:00:05,619 --> 00:00:08,019
Scalpel.
Pulse rate, falling.

3
00:00:08,088 --> 00:00:10,522
Forceps.
Breathing, labored.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,254
Sutures.
This is a very dangerous operation.

5
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:18,662
Oh, I know.
Just let me concentrate.

6
00:00:18,732 --> 00:00:22,498
[Man #2]
You've got to save her, Dr. Basey.
Her father owns the hospital.

7
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:24,469
[Static, Buzzing]

8
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:28,838
There goes that set again. Right
in the middle of my favorite comedy.

9
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:30,843
Try another channel, Grandpa.

10
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:33,209
[Wailing]

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,681
[Squeaks]
Will you be quiet, Igor?

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,151
He hates television ever since
Bat Masterson went off the air.

13
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:47,717
[Squeaking]
All right, Igor.
Good night. Good night.

14
00:00:49,796 --> 00:00:53,789
You shouldn't have repaired this thing
with those war surplus radar parts.

15
00:00:57,204 --> 00:00:59,138
Why are you so hotheaded, Herman?

16
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:02,039
I can't help it.
That's the way I'm made.

17
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:05,135
Maybe you'll get a new
TV set for your birthday.

18
00:01:05,212 --> 00:01:08,113
[TVWhistling]
You and your radar parts.

19
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:10,979
It's tuning in on our own house again.

20
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:15,852
[Chuckling]
Hey, look. There's Eddie trying
to catch dinner for the cat.

21
00:01:15,922 --> 00:01:19,915
- We'll get him this time.
- [Growls]

22
00:01:19,993 --> 00:01:23,326
- [Squawks] Missed me!
- [Growls]

23
00:01:23,397 --> 00:01:26,889
Look, there's Marilyn
and Lily in the kitchen.

24
00:01:28,702 --> 00:01:31,193
I wonder if they're talking about us.

25
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:34,001
See if you can tune in the sound.
I love to eavesdrop.

26
00:01:35,108 --> 00:01:38,305
It'll be wonderful for Eddie
to have a little playmate, Aunt Lily.

27
00:01:38,378 --> 00:01:40,471
But what about breaking
the news to Uncle Herman?

28
00:01:40,547 --> 00:01:42,481
Oh, that's not important.

29
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:45,677
Telling Herman is a little detail
I can take care of anytime.

30
00:01:45,752 --> 00:01:48,380
A new playmate for Eddie.

31
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:50,389
Did you hear that, Herman?

32
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:52,391
She's having a baby?

33
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:54,427
And telling me is just a detail?

34
00:01:54,494 --> 00:01:57,327
[Chuckles]
Isn't that typical of women?

35
00:01:57,397 --> 00:01:59,831
So often the husband
is the last to know.

36
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:04,492
What do you think, Grandpa?
Will it be a boy or a girl?

37
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:06,505
Probably.

38
00:03:11,338 --> 00:03:14,034
Aunt Lily, a minute ago
while we were talking,

39
00:03:14,107 --> 00:03:16,405
did you have the feeling
someone was watching us?

40
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:19,036
No. But I'll check.

41
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:22,977
Eddie, are you hiding in there again?

42
00:03:24,784 --> 00:03:29,084
Nope, not in there.
Maybe Grandpa's
hanging in the cupboard.

43
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:34,551
Grandpa.

44
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:36,755
Nevermore.
[Squawks]

45
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,492
I wish that stupid raven
would stay in his clock.

46
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:44,361
I guess I was mistaken.
Oh, Marilyn.

47
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:48,533
It'll be such fun having
another child around the house,
even if it's only for a little while.

48
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,542
How long will
the little fellow be with us?

49
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,637
Just a week or so.
He's Dr. Dudley's son.
I've been babysitting with them.

50
00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:56,909
Oh, yes. Our family doctor.

51
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:58,917
Herman went to him once,

52
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:02,045
but the poor fellow fainted
during the examination.

53
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:04,056
It upset Herman so much
he never went back.

54
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:06,558
The doctor and his wife
are going to a convention.

55
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:08,924
So I said we'd keep little Elmer
until they come back.

56
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,194
Here's Dr. Dudley's card,
so we can get in touch with him.

57
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:14,529
Hmm.

58
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:17,502
I think I'll break the news
to your Uncle Herman gently.

59
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:19,505
His birthday's coming up this week...

60
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:22,235
and you know how he feels
about strange people in the house.

61
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:25,938
Yes, you better tell him when
he's in a good mood. We wouldn't
want him to go all to pieces.

62
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:30,847
Oh, I know. It's such a nuisance
putting him back together again.

63
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:38,316
Devil's food cake.
They all love it.

64
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:47,356
[Thunderclap]

65
00:04:55,742 --> 00:04:59,371
Oh, isn't it restful to sit out here
after supper, Herman?

66
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:03,212
Yes. We had weather
just like this on our honeymoon.

67
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:05,251
Remember?

68
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:07,252
What a beautiful spot that was.

69
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,379
Devil's Island.

70
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:11,856
Too bad they closed it down.

71
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:14,257
Seems like all the really nice
resorts are gone.

72
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:18,423
It's a shame we've never kept in touch
with that charming Captain Dreyfuss.

73
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:20,432
Hmm.

74
00:05:22,335 --> 00:05:24,269
You're not very talkative
this evening, Lily.

75
00:05:26,072 --> 00:05:28,939
Are you sure there isn't anything
you want to tell me?

76
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:32,536
I mean, anything about
a little, uh, bundle?

77
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:34,739
- [Chuckles]
- Bundle?

78
00:05:35,882 --> 00:05:37,816
Oh, I'm glad you reminded me, Herman.

79
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:40,079
I have a whole bundle
oflaundry downstairs.

80
00:05:40,153 --> 00:05:42,314
I must go out and hang it on the line,

81
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:44,584
take advantage
of this beautiful weather.

82
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:49,261
Lily, you just dropped a piece of pap...

83
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:51,263
Lily.

84
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:02,708
"Dr. Dudley, M.D."?
[Thunderclap]

85
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:10,142
Well, here we are, Herman.
"4919 Woodbury Drive."

86
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:12,150
Dr. Dudley's house.

87
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:14,584
I hate to do this
behind Lily's back, Grandpa.

88
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:16,622
Now, Herman.
You're her husband.

89
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,716
If she's going to be coy about it
and not tell you what's going on,

90
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:22,785
you've gotta find out
everything for yourself.

91
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:26,389
Well, at least we won't be
bothering them at this hour.

92
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:28,798
It's only 4:00 in the morning.
Of course.

93
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:30,699
I've seen those intern movies.

94
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,762
This is just about the time
when most doctors are getting home...

95
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,331
from all those wild parties
they have all the time.

96
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:38,240
Come on.

97
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:41,842
Edward, what are you doing?

98
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:44,440
What am I doing?
I'm dying of indigestion.

99
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:46,451
That's what I'm doing.

100
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,716
Shh, shh. Couldn't you be
a little more quiet about it?

101
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:51,723
Do you want to
wake up little Elmer?

102
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,158
I lost my darn glasses, and you know
I can't see a thing without them.

103
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:57,822
You and your oysters Rockefeller.

104
00:06:57,897 --> 00:07:00,923
For the past two hours, I've been having
the most horrible nightmares.

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,333
I'm going downstairs
and drink some hot milk.

106
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:06,838
Oh, you look awful, dear.
Get back in bed. You're sick.

107
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:09,898
That's you.
I'm over here.

108
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:13,207
I wondered what you were
doing in my pajamas.

109
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:17,672
[Doorbell Rings]
I'll get it, dear.

110
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:22,917
Now remember, Herman.
Don't beat around the bush.

111
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:26,015
Just ask him point-blank about Lily.

112
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:28,322
Okay, if you say so.

113
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:30,658
Yes, yes?

114
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,755
What is it at this hour?

115
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:35,801
Excuse me, Doctor,
but could I ask you something?

116
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:39,703
Well, who are you?
You look like a patient of mine.

117
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:41,866
One that I lost recently.

118
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:44,933
I'm Herman Munster.
And you're our family doctor.

119
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:47,809
Oh, yes. Didn't I examine you once?

120
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:50,441
Yes, but you fainted
in the middle of the examination.

121
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:54,180
[Chuckles]
Did I? I gotta watch that fainting.

122
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:57,951
It could be quite embarrassing if
I fainted in the middle of an operation.

123
00:07:58,024 --> 00:08:01,960
[Chuckling]
Doctor, could you answer a question?

124
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:06,055
How do you like that? When I don't
have my glasses on, I hear double.

125
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:08,157
No, this is Grandpa.

126
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:14,402
Oh. Looks rather like
a tall penguin, doesn't he?

127
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:18,137
What was the question?
Oh, well, it's about my wife and I.

128
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:20,236
Uh, I wanted to know...

129
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:22,247
[Clears Throat]

130
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:24,249
Whether we're expecting.

131
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:26,683
Expecting? Expecting what?

132
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:29,415
You know, a child at our house.

133
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:32,686
Oh, yes. All the arrangements
have been made.

134
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,693
Oh, thank you, Doctor.

135
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:36,888
Thank you.
Oh, say, now I remember you.

136
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:39,158
You had your doggie
with you the last time too.

137
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:42,497
Friendly little fellow, isn't he?
Giving me his paw.

138
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:45,538
Well, good night.

139
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:48,540
You see, Herman?
I told you it was true.

140
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:53,511
The moment you found his card, I knew
he wasn't treating Lily for no hangnail.

141
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:06,284
Well, did you get your hot milk, dear?
I couldn't find the kitchen.

142
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:09,352
Anyway, someone came to the door.

143
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:11,795
Who was it?
That Mr. Munster.

144
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:14,595
His niece is gonna
take care of little Elmer for us.

145
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:17,158
I don't know
what he was driving at.

146
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:20,570
Well, anyway, it's very nice
of them to do it for us.

147
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,132
Marilyn is so sweet.
What is her uncle like?

148
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,338
I couldn't get him in focus
too well without my specs.

149
00:09:27,413 --> 00:09:31,144
All I'm sure of is he was nine feet tall
and had a penguin with him...

150
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:33,879
that turned out to be his grandfather.

151
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:37,651
Oh, Edward.
You'd better get some sleep.

152
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:41,820
I didn't think worrying about Medicare
was upsetting you this much.

153
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:43,954
I'm fine. I'm fine.

154
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,989
All I need is a good night's rest.
Okay.

155
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:50,535
Good night, honey.
Good night.

156
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:57,275
My, this mattress is lumpy.

157
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:02,581
I've got something
important to ask you.

158
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:04,583
Uncle Herman's not around, is he?

159
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:07,484
No, he took Spotty down
to the car wash for his weekly bath.

160
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:09,851
I just don't know what
to get him for his birthday.

161
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:12,391
Do you think he'd like
a new snakeskin tobacco pouch?

162
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,983
I don't think so, dear.
The old one is still wiggling.

163
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:17,929
What are you getting him?

164
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:21,433
Well, he's been talking about
a second car for months now.

165
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:24,595
I have an appointment
with a car dealer downtown.

166
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:26,764
A car would be a wonderful
surprise for Uncle Herman.

167
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:30,570
I'm going to pick it out today
and have it delivered on his birthday.

168
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:34,306
Well, maybe I'll just get him another
season pass to Forest Memorial Park.

169
00:10:56,002 --> 00:10:58,197
[Footsteps]

170
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:11,748
Hello there.
Are you Diamond Jim?

171
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:14,946
Yes, ma'am. How do you do?
I'm Mrs. Munster.

172
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:17,922
I called here about an hour ago.
Are you the one I talked to?

173
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:20,653
No, it must have been
my brother, Diamond Irving.

174
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:24,822
You looking for a bargain
in luxury transportation?

175
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:28,628
Yes. I would like something nice
for my husband's birthday.

176
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:32,297
Excuse me, lady.
But were you ever in the movies?

177
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:35,364
Oh, yes.
Just last Saturday night...

178
00:11:35,441 --> 00:11:39,002
we saw a lovely picture,
The Body Snatchers.

179
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:43,139
No, no. I mean, I thought I might have
seen you on the late, late show.

180
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:46,049
Me?
[Chuckles]

181
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:48,952
Oh, well. Now, how about
this little baby first?

182
00:11:49,022 --> 00:11:51,013
Oh.

183
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:54,192
Hmm, how much is this one?

184
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,524
Isn't it a dream? 7,800.

185
00:11:56,596 --> 00:12:00,794
Executive car, turned in yesterday
by a California minister.

186
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:03,199
I'm afraid my husband
wouldn't like leopard skin.

187
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:06,329
Do you have anything
upholstered in wolf hide?

188
00:12:06,406 --> 00:12:08,931
Wolf hide? Wolf hide.

189
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:12,239
Let me see.
How about this one?

190
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:15,347
Isn't this a beauty?

191
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:18,646
This little hotrod is done
in genuine Tijuana tuck 'n' roll.

192
00:12:18,718 --> 00:12:21,915
My, this is rather dashing, isn't it?
Yep.

193
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:24,013
And we do have
a growing boy in the family.

194
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,024
Good.

195
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:29,493
Oh, look at that.
There is a handsome car.

196
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:33,498
You mean you like that one, lady?

197
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:35,397
Oh, yes.

198
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh, this is the sort of car our family
could get a lot of use out of.

199
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:48,673
Grandpa's been just dying
for something like this.

200
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:51,581
If he saw it,
he would just flip his lid.

201
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:54,586
But lady, this is not a car.
It's a...

202
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:56,588
I'll take it.
You will?

203
00:12:56,656 --> 00:13:00,353
And that darling little roadster too.
You mean you want both of them?

204
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:03,293
If you can make a few
modifications for me.
Yeah.

205
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:05,296
Now I'll tell you
what I want you to do.
What?

206
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:08,060
Take that car there and this one.
Mm-hmm.

207
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:10,068
Call the custom body shop...
Yeah.

208
00:13:10,136 --> 00:13:13,902
And tell them it's a rush job,
and then have them...

209
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:15,907
Oh, Herman.

210
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:20,344
You know,
I just love digging in the garden.
It makes you feel so close to the soil.

211
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:23,007
I know, the garden's looking
much better this year too.

212
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:25,209
Everything's dying out early.

213
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:28,515
Yeah. Herman, by the way,
has Lily mentioned...

214
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:32,080
you know what, the little stranger?
Not a word.

215
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:35,286
It's been four or five days now,
and I've given her all sorts of hints.

216
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:38,762
Well, I guess there's no
understanding women.

217
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:42,699
You know, I never knew when
half of my wives were expecting.

218
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:46,135
You know, Grandpa, I feel like
relaxing after all that work outside.

219
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:49,697
How about a game of chess?
Hey, I got a better idea.

220
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:51,709
Why don't the two of us
go in the living room...

221
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:55,144
and have a three-handed
game of solitaire?
You're on.

222
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:58,083
Thank you.

223
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:00,176
That's right, Diamond Jim.

224
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:02,187
My husband's birthday is on Wednesday,

225
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:04,519
and I want to be sure
you have the car ready by then.

226
00:14:05,825 --> 00:14:09,124
I haven't told my husband
a thing about it.

227
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:11,425
It'll be a complete surprise to him.

228
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:14,193
She must be talking to the doctor
about the new baby.

229
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:18,602
It will make a nice birthday gift.

230
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:22,630
I think it shows a lot more thought than
just getting him a necktie, don't you?

231
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:26,978
Oh, yes. I understand all about
the 30-day guarantee.

232
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:30,812
And if my husband doesn't like it,
we can always trade it in.

233
00:14:30,883 --> 00:14:36,150
Trade it in? Are you sure
that she's talking about a baby?

234
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:39,885
And one more thing.
Don't forget about the seat covers.

235
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:43,956
Believe me.
She's talking about a baby.

236
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:53,202
Morning, Lily.
Good morning, dear.

237
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:04,042
Well, good morning.

238
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:07,676
Now, Lily. I want you
to do absolutely nothing...

239
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:09,721
while I set the table and fix breakfast.

240
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:11,950
That's very sweet of you, Herman, but...
Lily.

241
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:14,754
I will not have you slaving
over a hot cauldron...

242
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:17,318
at a time like this.
Don't be silly, dear.

243
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:20,524
No, Lily. I want you
to sit right down at that table.

244
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,068
Let Herman put you
in the driver's seat.

245
00:15:29,508 --> 00:15:31,442
Herman, you're so forceful.

246
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:35,679
Only four plates this morning,
darling. Marilyn left early.

247
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:40,151
Hello, Grandpa.
Hello, everybody.

248
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:42,153
Bottom of the morning to you.

249
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:45,054
Grandpa, please.
Allow me.

250
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:48,754
Sit right down.

251
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:51,695
This morning,
I'm fixing breakfast.

252
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:55,063
Oh, yes, yes. I understand.

253
00:15:55,134 --> 00:15:57,967
That's very thoughtful of you, Herman.

254
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:17,718
Lovely weeds for a lovely lady.

255
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:21,222
Thank you, dear.

256
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:25,731
Good morning.
Good morning, Eddie.

257
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:28,699
Good morning.
Eddie, Eddie. Allow me.

258
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:34,172
There you go, son.

259
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:37,832
?? [Herman Humming]

260
00:16:40,146 --> 00:16:42,137
Hey, Daddy's getting breakfast.

261
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:45,115
What's up, Grandpa?
Shh.

262
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:48,984
?? [Herman Humming]

263
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,352
Was Daddy playing poker all night
with those men from the office?

264
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:55,587
No, dear.

265
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,996
He must have done something
pretty bad to be acting this mushy.

266
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:09,667
Not at all, Eddie. Your father is just
naturally a sweet and kind man.

267
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:13,702
Aren't you, pussycat?
I try to be.

268
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:17,072
Mother.

269
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:22,617
Sit right down, dear.

270
00:17:24,523 --> 00:17:26,889
I just fixed you
a little snack for lunch.

271
00:17:28,227 --> 00:17:32,596
Oh, strawberries and pickles?

272
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:34,826
Well, that's very
thoughtful of you, Herman.

273
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,733
Not at all, dear. You just sit there
and enjoy your food...

274
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:40,294
while I play a little something
for you on the organ.

275
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:46,044
?? [Organ]

276
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:51,983
Brahms's "Lullaby."

277
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:55,283
You play so well, dear.

278
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:57,879
Herman, there's something
I want to tell you,

279
00:17:57,957 --> 00:17:59,891
and I've been waiting
for the right moment.

280
00:18:01,394 --> 00:18:04,454
It's about time, Lily.
But you don't have to say another word.

281
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,828
I already know.
You do?

282
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:12,030
Yes. And I think the idea
of having a little playmate
for Eddie is just wonderful.

283
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:14,038
How did you find out?

284
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:17,667
Herman, sometimes I think
you're absolutely uncanny.

285
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:21,543
Well, I guess I sort of accidentally
eavesdropped on you and Marilyn.

286
00:18:21,614 --> 00:18:24,583
And then I sort of
ran into Dr. Dudley.

287
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,915
Oh, you old busybody, you.
[Chuckles]

288
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:29,921
Never mind that.

289
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:32,890
What I'm dying to know is when...

290
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,926
when the child is due.

291
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:38,896
I mean, approximately.
Approximately? I can tell you exactly.

292
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:41,933
It's a boy. He'll arrive
at 9:00 tomorrow morning.

293
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:44,265
And his name is Elmer.

294
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:46,998
9:00 is perfect, don't you think?

295
00:18:47,072 --> 00:18:50,405
And then if he's hungry, he can
sit down and have breakfast with us.

296
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:54,277
Herman, what's the matter?

297
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:56,280
You have that funny look on your face.

298
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,484
Oh, nothing.
I was just thinking that...

299
00:18:59,552 --> 00:19:02,544
science has made some awfully
big strides since Eddie was born.

300
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:05,522
But I guess automation is everywhere.

301
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:13,698
Hello.
Here we are, Elmer.

302
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:15,700
Aunt Lily, I want you
to meet little Elmer.

303
00:19:15,768 --> 00:19:17,702
Mrs. Dudley just dropped him off.

304
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:22,469
Well, so this is the little boy
who's come to stay with us for a while.

305
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,475
Oh, isn't that fine?

306
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,979
Eddie, Elmer's here.

307
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:30,846
Hi, Elmer.
Hi.

308
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:35,614
Boy, you've got neat ears.
Aw, they're not so great.

309
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:38,179
Eddie, why don't you take Elmer
in the other room to play?

310
00:19:38,257 --> 00:19:40,919
Okay. Come on, Elmer.
Here are some toys he brought with him.

311
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:43,894
Oh, neato! Come on.

312
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:46,523
Isn't he a sweet little boy?

313
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:50,330
Yes, but he certainly
isn't as handsome as Eddie.

314
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:52,461
I mean, his ears aren't
the least bit pointed.

315
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:54,904
And, oh, what a dreadful haircut.

316
00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:59,570
I do wish Herman hadn't slept so late.
The car I ordered got here an hour ago.

317
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:02,637
I mean, really, on his own birthday.
The least he could do would be to...

318
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:04,649
Shh, here he comes.

319
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:09,277
Morning, Lily.
Morning, dear.

320
00:20:09,355 --> 00:20:11,653
Good morning, Marilyn.
Oh, thank you.

321
00:20:11,724 --> 00:20:13,658
I kept your breakfast cold for you.

322
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:15,660
Oh, no, Lily. I couldn't eat
any breakfast this morning.

323
00:20:15,728 --> 00:20:17,662
I'm much too excited.

324
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,392
You know,
thinking about the child.

325
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:24,698
Oh, him. Well, he got here a few
minutes ago, right on schedule.

326
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,704
He's in the living room.

327
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:28,763
Oh, Herman!

328
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:33,108
Never mind that.

329
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:35,112
Lily, he just arrived?

330
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,114
And you're working here
in the kitchen?

331
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:39,844
Well, why not?
He's in the living room.

332
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,150
Now why don't you go in
and introduce yourself?

333
00:20:43,222 --> 00:20:45,156
Introduce myself?

334
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:47,590
Go on, dearie. Go on.

335
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,891
And then I have a real surprise for you.

336
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:52,624
Okay, Lily.

337
00:20:52,698 --> 00:20:57,294
But, Lily, I don't think I can take
too many more surprises today.

338
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:08,907
Gee, Elmer. You sure got
a lot of neat stuff to play with.

339
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:10,915
How does this work?

340
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:13,850
By remote control.
I'll show you.

341
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,251
Put it down.

342
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:25,630
Son?

343
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,767
Elmer?

344
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,270
Son?

345
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:42,140
It's my boy!

346
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:45,807
It's my boy!

347
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:49,287
And he looks just like me!

348
00:21:49,355 --> 00:21:51,983
Sonny! Come to Daddy!

349
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:55,891
Herman! Herman,
what's all the excitement?

350
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:58,293
It's my son. He's here.

351
00:21:58,364 --> 00:22:00,832
And, Grandpa, look.
He's walking already.

352
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:04,502
Isn't he beautiful?
Isn't he beautiful?

353
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:08,870
[Squeaks]
Listen, Herman.
He's trying to say "Daddy."

Oopsy-daisy.

356

They had the same trouble with me
when I was his age.

357
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:21,851
Eddie. Eddie, come here.

358
00:22:23,555 --> 00:22:26,490
Eddie, meet your new playmate.

359
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:29,288
Playmate? This is just a toy.

360
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:32,421
Here's my new playmate.
Elmer.

361
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:35,592
I want you to meet my pop.
How do you do, Mr. Munster?

362
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:38,193
You mean...
You mean this is...

363
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:41,672
You mean he...
You mean...

364
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,436
With a face like that?

365
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,138
Oh, no.

366
00:22:47,212 --> 00:22:49,840
What a catastrophe!

367
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:59,980
You mean...
You mean it's someone else's child?

368
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,220
And we're just keeping him for a while?

369
00:23:02,294 --> 00:23:06,390
Of course, dear. I don't know how
you could've gotten the wrong idea.

370
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:08,399
Oh, thank goodness.

371
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:11,459
I'd die if we ever had a child
that looked like that.

372
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:14,973
Come on, Uncle Herman. Aunt Lily has a
wonderful birthday present to show you.

373
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,201
Oh.

374
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:19,904
Oh, I'd almost forgotten
about it being my birthday.

375
00:23:19,978 --> 00:23:22,139
Come along, Herman.
It's right outside.

376
00:23:22,214 --> 00:23:24,580
Oh.

377
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,347
Step, step.
Don't open them till I tell you.

378
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,354
No peeking, Uncle Herman.

379
00:23:30,422 --> 00:23:32,754
Take it easy.
This will be a surprise.

380
00:23:32,825 --> 00:23:35,191
Oh, this is going to be a big surprise.

381
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:39,157
All right.

382
00:23:39,231 --> 00:23:41,529
Bring it out, Grandpa.

Open your eyes now, Herman.

00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:57,040
Lily!
Happy birthday.

387
00:23:57,116 --> 00:24:00,779
How do you like it, Herman?
I had it customized just for you.

388
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:02,787
Oh, it's just beautiful.

389
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:07,987
Getting a car like this and finding out
that little Elmer is not our child...

390
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,221
makes this the happiest
birthday I've ever had.

Come on, everybody. Hop in!

through the cemetery.
