[Door Slams Shut]
Herman's home.
[Clanging]
Lily, either hang those things
so they don't fall down...
or have them tuned.
Lily? Lily!
I have some wonderful news for you,
and I can't keep it in any longer.
I'm busting at the seams.
Well, don't do it in here, dear.
I'm getting supper.
I have to tell you
what happened today.
Mr. Gateman down at the parlor
asked me into his private office,
and he gave me
a great compliment.
He said I'm one of the few people there
who never lies down on the job.
Oh, Herman, you've really stuck
to the job down there.
You've seen a lot of people
come and go.
Well, don't keep us in midair.
What did your boss say?
He gave me a promotion.
He's making me manager
of one of our branch offices.
Oh, manager!
Oh, wait till Grandpa's relatives
in the Old Country hear about this!
They'll really sit up on
their hind legs and take notice.
There's only one thing.
For me to take the job, we have
to sell the house and move to Buffalo.
- Sell the house?
- Sell the house?
That's right.
And then all we Munsters
will just shuffle off to Buffalo.
? Oh, I'll go and get my shoesies
and we'll pack up all our bluesies?
? And away we'll go?
? Ooh, ooh, ooh?
? Off we're gonna shuffle
shuffle off to Buffalo??
[Crashing]
Uh, Spot? Spot! Go fetch!
[Growling]
Bring back Daddy.
[Growling]
And,
uh, inasmuch as this new job
touches all our futures,
I thought it very important
to convene the entire family.
Big deal.
We were all sitting here, anyway.
All you had to do
was start talking.
By the way, where's Eddie?
He's spending the weekend with
one of his little friends from school.
Oh, yes.
Well, uh, now,
on the pro side of this thing,
this promotion will mean
a sizable increase in salary, plus...
a lot of other benefits,
which will accrue.
But, on the other hand,
it is also gonna mean that we...
Lily? Grandpa?
Oh, where did everyone go?
Herman, we're all here.
Oh. Oh, yes.
Uh, of course.
As I was saying, now...
Uh, but, on the other hand,
it will also mean selling
this beautiful home,
with all its charm and graciousness
and exquisite furniture.
And I thought that,
in a matter so vital to all of us,
we should put it to a family vote.
Uh, Lily?
Herman,
a wife's place is with her husband.
Whither thou goest, I shall go.
Good.
Lily has decided to "whither"
with me. Marilyn?
Oh, I'd be happy to move to Buffalo.
Maybe I'll meet some boys
who won't think I'm so plain.
Good. Grandpa?
It's all right with me.
I'm as free as a bat.
I can pull up stakes anytime.
Fine. Then it's all settled.
I'll call Mr. Gateman,
tell him I'll take the new job,
and we'll put an ad in the newspaper
and sell this house.
There's one person we haven't
consulted yet... little Eddie.
Oh, well, I'm sure he'll go for it.
Children always adjust very easily
to any new environment.
[Chuckling]
It was neat, Eddie,
the way Coach
made you catcher...
and picked you for the captain
of the baseball team.
There's a lot of guys
better than me.
What I think sold the coach
was the way you snagged up
those foul tips with your teeth.
You know, Eddie,
now that you're on our team,
we'll probably win
the city championship.
I hope so.
I sure like going to this school
and all the guys I met.
You know, I'd rather live here than
any other place in the whole world.
Last year, our best shortstop's family
moved him to another school district,
and we lost the finals.
So all us guys took an oath
never to speak to him again.
You don't have to worry about that.
Once, my mother told me we
were gonna live where we are...
for the rest of our lives,
and maybe even longer.
Oh, boy, somebody's stopping.
Naturally.
[Chuckles]
This is the kind of house that would
stand out in any neighborhood.
This must be it, Mother.
"1313 Mockingbird Lane."
Oh, my! That's the kind of a house
in those Alfred Hitchcock pictures...
that always gets hit by lightning.
[Thunderclap]
Oh, my goodness!
Don't sit there, Daddy.
Let's burn rubber!
[Tires Squealing]
Look at the way they took off.
Well, we wouldn't want to sell it
to any hot-rodders, anyway.
My, what a setup, eh, Momma?
First, we run the s√©ances.
Then we make with the phony ghosts.
Then we rake in the dough.
Yeah, Poppa.
Eh, it's a little clean, but it'll do.
Now listen, kids. Don't steal
nothing till we make the deal, eh?
[Thunderous Knocking]
Yes?
Poppa, what do you think?
I think the gypsies got here first
and spook the place already.
Uh, excuse the intrude.
Uh, good luck, brother.
Grandpa, get inside, quick.
Herman, what's the matter?
You look as black as a sheet.
Those were gypsies.
They cast spells, practice sorcery
and give people the evil eye.
Oh, I'm glad they
didn't buy our house.
Me too.
I can't stand competition.
Oh, Herman, we've had
open house all day.
And the few people who did
show up didn't even come in.
I just can't understand it.
This house offers everything
a family could want.
And we're close-in,
and we have a beautiful yard
with a kidney-shaped swamp.
Oh! Susie, if this place is for sale,
there must be some
wonderful old relics inside.
Perhaps we can
pick them up for a song.
Oh!
Oh. D-Do you think
we should knock?
I think we should go right in.
The sign says "open house."
[Door Creaking]
Susan, what a quaint old house.
[Gasps]
And just look at this antique hat rack.
Oh! The wormholes
are already in it.
Isn't that fine!
We won't have to drill our own.
Ooh! And just look
at that newel post.
[Both Gasping]
I bet they don't realize its value.
We'll tell 'em it's a lot of junk
and then practically steal it.
[Both Laughing]
[Growling]
[Screaming]
[Tires Squealing]
Uh, did you hear something, Lily?
Oh, that's just Spot, dear.
He's had indigestion all morning.
Oh. I guess he got out again and got
ahold of some bad telephone poles.
Grandpa, we want you
to sit on the house for a while.
Marilyn and I have to go
downtown shopping,
and Herman has to go out too.
Yes. If we're gonna move, we're
gonna have to pack a lot of things.
I'm gonna stop by the parlor
and pick up some empty boxes.
I'll have the house sold
before you get back.
Don't worry about a thing, Lily.
I won't let anyone get away.
Oh, how could you, Grandpa?
What's the matter?
If someone goes for the chicken
sandwich, we got a deal.
Grandpa? We'll have none of that.
What we want is someone who loves
the house for its charm alone.
Spoilsport.
Pops? Pops?
Uh, please.
Come on. Wake up!
Let me sleep
another hundred years.
Pops.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, tell me something.
This your ad in the paper?
Yes.
This the price?
That's right.
I'll take it.
You'll take it?
But you haven't seen it yet.
Do you wanna argue
or sell the house?
Yeah, but...
Here's a check
for the down payment.
Just sign this contract
for the temporary bill of sale.
Ooh!
Well, thank you. Thank you.
Yeah, thank you.
Forget it.
Oh, and, uh, Pops,
if I were you,
I'd get back in the house.
You look like you've been out
in the sun too long.
Grandpa, that's wonderful.
You sold the house.
Well, it did take all my charm
and powers of salesmanship,
but I really put on the pressure
and closed that deal.
Now we can move to Buffalo,
and Uncle Herman can take his new job.
Oh, boy, old Hermie's got it made.
[Laughing]
? I'll go up and get my shoesies
and we'll pack up all our bluesies?
? And away we'll go?
[Together]
? Ooh, ooh, ooh?
? Off we're gonna shuffle
shuffle off to Buffalo??
[Laughing]
Hey, what's all the excitement?
Did Grandpa win
the Transylvanian sweepstakes?
No, Eddie, but we have some
wonderful, wonderful news for you.
Yeah? Well, I've got some good news too.
It's about the school baseball team.
Eddie, uh, just a minute.
Your father has a new job.
We just sold the house.
And we're all moving to Buffalo.
- Isn't that wonderful, Eddie?
- I won't go!
I won't! I won't! I won't!
You can't make me!
You can't! You can't!
I'm not gonna leave my friends!
I'm not! I'm not! I'm not!
You can kill me a million,
million times, and I still won't go.!
[Door Creaking, Closing]
You know, Lily, I don't think
he exactly cares for the idea.
Grandpa, I wonder how Herman's
making out with Eddie.
He's upstairs now,
trying to calm him down.
I had no idea he'd be so upset
about moving and leaving his friends.
I know how it is.
In the Old Country,
I was always getting attached
to my friends and neighbors,
especially at night.
Well, one thing about Herman...
he has a way of getting
to the heart of a matter.
And so the little rabbit
said to the prairie dog,
"Listen, prairie dog,
why do you take your family...
and move out of a perfectly good
burrow to someplace far away?"
What's a burrow?
Burrow?
Well, it's sort of like
a home, sort of.
But what the little rabbit was trying
to tell the prairie dog was...
that he shouldn't move
just because he thought the food
was better somewhere else.
I think it's dumb for a rabbit
to tell a prairie dog what to do.
Exactly.
And you know what happened?
What?
The prairie dog did move
with his whole family,
and he found out the food was better
and the new burrow was better,
and he made lots of new friends
and everything was... neato!
And the stupid rabbit stayed
where he was and ate the dumb food...
and stayed with his dumb friends.
Right.
And somebody probably caught
the rabbit and painted him pink
for Easter or something.
Exactly.
That's what the rabbit got...
for not grasping at an opportunity
and moving to a new place.
So, you see what a good idea it
would be for us all to move to Buffalo?
And the prairie dog probably
got eaten by a kangaroo,
'cause he never saw kangaroos before,
and because they didn't have kangaroos
where he used to live.
Right. Uh, uh, no.
No. No, wrong. Wrong, wrong.
Uh, Eddie, kangaroos
don't eat prairie dogs.
Uh, they're allergic to them.
And the stupid rabbit
stayed where he was...
and got fat and had pink kids!
Wait a minute.
The prairie dog is the hero
of this story, not the rabbit.
And the rabbit sent letters to the prairie
dog, but they came back unanswered.
So the rabbit knew it was smarter
to stay in his own burrow...
than moving away and getting
eaten up by a kangaroo.
Wait a minute...
Boy, Dad, thanks for
telling me the neat story.
Now I can sleep tonight without
worrying about moving to Buffalo.
Gee, Dad, I'm glad you came up here
and explained it to me.
Yeah.
Sure, Eddie. So am I.
Bye, Mom.
Bye, Dad.
Bye, son.
Now I can go to school and tell
all the guys that I don't have to move...
and that I can be the captain
of the school baseball team.
Boy, this is the neatest thing
that's happened since
Grandpa dug up Spot for me.
Bye, Spot.
[Growling]
That happy little skip
in that happy little boy...
is worth a fortune
to his dear, old dad.
[Chuckling]
Herman, what happened?
Last night, you went up to explain
to Eddie why we had to move to Buffalo.
Suddenly, this morning,
it's all off.
Well, I tried to explain it to him,
but it just didn't work out.
I guess I should've used
the Three Little Pigs.
You know, I've always been
rotten with prairie dogs.
Well, I'm glad it happened.
It just proves to all of us
how much we love this place.
I agree, Marilyn.
Grandpa, you go call that
gentleman and tell him we
want out of the house deal.
I'm gonna go down to the parlor
and tell Mr. Gateman...
that I just can't take the new job.
Herman, he'll be disappointed,
so let him down gently.
Lily, have no fear.
In my business, we always
let people down gently.
But, Mr. Dennison,
we changed our minds.
What do you mean we can't?
A sales contract?
Bulldozers, wreckers
on their way over now?
[Chuckling]
Uh, Mr. Dennison, just a minute.
You can't talk to me that way.
[Line Disconnects]
I guess he can.
- Can we get our house back, Grandpa?
- I guess not, Eddie.
They're on their way over now
with bulldozers to tear it down.
Grandpa, what'll we do?
Herman's down at the parlor,
and those men will be here any minute.
What'll we do? We'll do
what men have done for centuries.
We'll stand firm and defend our homes.
We'll man the battlements, flood the moat
and pull in the drawbridge.
But, Grandpa, we don't have
any battlements or any moat.
Marilyn, will you please...
Don't be so technical.
I haven't had so much fun since
I started the French Revolution.
[Laughing]
The chains, Eddie!
Right, Grandpa.
[Sinister Laughter]
?? [Humming]
Here's Grandma's best silver.
Grandma's best silver.
Twenty pounds of bobby pins.
That oughta curl their hair.
Uh, here's one of Eddie's skates.
Oh, Eddie's skates.
?? [Humming]
[Laughs]
Wait till they get a taste
of this cast-iron fruit salad.
Here they come!
Oh, I won't fire unless I have to.
I sure hope I have to.
They think they can scare us off.
Listen, you people, I bought this house
to wreck it, and I'm gonna wreck it.
Hold off, sir!
Our home is our castle,
and we shall defend it,
down to the last man,
woman and child.
How do you like them apples, mister?
What is this?
We've run into trouble
like this before.
When we built those freeways,
the little old ladies...
tried to throw themselves down
in front of the bulldozers.
How come those weird getups?
You know these radicals.
They'll do anything to get
their picture in the paper.
All right, fellas. Get movin'.
Okay, stand back, people.
We're comin' through.
Okay, they're asking for it.
C'est la vie. That's the way
I goofed at Waterloo.
All right, folks.
You had your little joke.
Come on now. Break it up.
Yeah, Pops, knock it off.
What's going on here?
Are they kidding with him?
It's just another one
of those Halloween makeups
to try to get us off their backs.
Oh, Herman!
It's been a nightmare.
These men are gonna tear down
our house, and Mr. Dennison
won't listen to reason.
So we've been
protecting ourselves.
Lily, please. We'll have
to think this thing over.
After all, we did
sign that paper.
I knew it! I knew it!
Little Goody Two-shoes
had to show up.
Grandpa, right is right.
If they bought the house,
they have a right to tear it down.
And you can't just go around
aiming a cannon at everybody
without having anarchy.
And anarchy is violence.
And violence is... very naughty.
What are you going to do, Uncle Herman,
just let them take the house from us?
Marilyn, we shouldn't have signed
that piece of paper without reading it.
No, I'm going to ask them
if they'll allow us a few weeks
to find a place to live.
Aw, Pop, let's smash 'em now
and talk later.
Eddie, please!
Uh, good afternoon, gentlemen.
[Laughing]
Uh, I think there's something
we should discuss.
Listen, jack. I bought this house
to tear it down and put in a parking lot.
So why don't you just get out.
But, sir, uh, uh...
Uh, we... Uh...
Gentlemen, gentlemen, I think
we should talk this thing over.
Uh, now, look.
You seem to be reasonable types.
[Chuckling]
Uh, if you look
at the thing my... Oh.
If you look at the thing my way,
you'll just go back to your office...
and tear up that contract.
[Laughing]
[Loud Crash]
You see, Lily?
If you reason with people,
they'll see the light.
They were in such a hurry to get
back and tear up the contract,
they left their machinery behind.
Herman, you saved our home.
Pop, you're a hero.
Oh, shucks, it... it was nothing.
[Laughing]
Herman. Herman, we don't
want the neighbors to think
we keep an untidy place.
Go out and pick up the street.
Yes, dear.
[Grunts]
[Sighs]
[Crashing]
"And the property, therefore, reverts
to the original owner, Herman Munster."
That's wonderful!
That's great!
We have our house back.
Signed R. Dennison.
Hmm. Poor man writes
with a shaky hand.
What did they say
down at the parlor, dear?
Oh, well, Mr. Gateman decided
not to open the branch office in Buffalo.
He says he can't afford it.
Can't afford it?
No. He just went over the books
for the last two months...
and found out we've
been going in the hole.
Oh, hi, Eddie.
Eddie, you home
from school so soon?
[Pans Chime]
Lily, you had them tuned!
Eddie, how was
baseball practice today?
[Muffled Chatter]
Eddie, uh, turn around, son.
Come here. Come here.
[Pops]
Herman, there's
no two ways about it.
We're simply going to have
to buy Eddie a catcher's mitt.
