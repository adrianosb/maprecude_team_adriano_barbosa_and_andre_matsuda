1
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:31,139
How's the market?
Not so good.

2
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:34,070
International Pine Box
closed at a new low.

3
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,944
American Tombstone
toppled from its high point...

4
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:41,577
and now the government is threatening
to slap a lid on International Casket.

5
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:46,056
Well, never mind, Grandpa, remember,
everything that's down has to go up.

6
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:49,958
And by the same token, everything
that's up has to go down...

7
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,690
which is what keeps
Herman in business.

8
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:59,359
Is Pop home yet? Not yet, dear.
But be patient.

9
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,067
He'll be home in two shakes
of a werewolf's tail.

10
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,408
And when he does come home,
we'll let you know.

11
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:10,243
Why is Eddie so anxious for
Uncle Herman to come home?

12
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,783
Well, because
Herman's his father...

13
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:17,219
and he loves him, respects him, and
looks up to him with great admiration.

14
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,881
Yeah, and on top of that...

15
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:22,290
he promised to stop off
downtown and buy me a new kite.

16
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,905
Okay, come on up.

17
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,814
Up: up' up'

18
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,350
(man #1)
That's it, higher.

19
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:47,810
Okay.

20
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,816
Hank, watch out!
The rope's gonna break!

21
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,523
Don't move, we'll call an ambulance.
Ambulance?

22
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,830
Thank you, you're very kind,
sir, but I feel fine.

23
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,930
Impossible, it flattened
your head like a pancake.

24
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,134
I don't know what you're talking about.
I never felt better.

25
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:16,010
Mister, don't be so confident.
Wait till you look in a mirror.

26
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,177
Just look at him.

27
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,344
We'd better get his name
before he kicks the bucket.

28
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,444
I don't know
what's keeping him up.

29
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,922
What's your name, mister?
My name?

30
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,081
My name is...

31
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,691
My name?

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,267
That's funny, I haven't got
the vaguest idea.

33
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,463
My name is...

34
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,501
Herman is three hours late. What
could have happened to him?

35
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,168
Maybe the store
was all out of kites...

36
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,041
and he's too ashamed
to face me.

37
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,081
No, he's had an accident.

38
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,714
There's no other explanation.
My Hermie has had an accident.

39
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,980
Lily, don't be so pessimistic.

40
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,787
Well, all I know is I wish he'd hurry
up and get home to give me my new kite.

41
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:12,489
Eddie, I wish you'd stop worrying
about your stupid kite...

42
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,362
and start worrying
about your stupid father.

43
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,028
Eddie, your father
wouldn't let you down.

44
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:23,471
Even if he was lying dead someplace,
he'd be thoughtful enough to phone.

45
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,004
<i>8:30 and where's Big Daddy?</i>

46
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:30,413
8:30, it's time
for my favorite TV program.

47
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,311
It's all about that crazy,
mixed-up family...

48
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,548
that's always having those
weird, fantastic adventures.

49
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,886
<i>(male announcer) We delay the
start of Nb; Three Sons...</i>

50
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,653
<i>to bring you
this special bulletin.</i>

51
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:45,787
<i>Local police have taken an amnesia

52
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,560
<i>Here is a picture

00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,901

54
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,097
<i>is urged to contact police

55
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,572
Well, that's not
John Doe, that's Pop.

56
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,664
[sighs]

57
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,372
Uncle Herman has amnesia.
My poor, poor darling.

58
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:07,477
Lily, be calm. Herman is
safe and in good hands.

59
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,818
And you and I will go down to claim
him, right after <i>My Three</i> Sons.

60
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:15,517
No, we won't, we'll go
down and claim him now.

61
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,328
Grandpa, you go
and get your cloak.

62
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,824
Yes, Professor. Yes,
we'll check them both out.

63
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,470
Thank you for
being good citizens.

64
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:32,070
That, Officer Kugel,
was the university.

65
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:36,775
Two of their scientists saw a picture
of John Doe on television...

66
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,713
and each got a theory.

67
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,411
One figures he's a creature
from outer space.

68
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,976
And the other?

69
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,750
The other figures
he's a missing link...

70
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,486
but he can't figure
what he's a link to.

71
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,891
[laughing]

72
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,861
Sarge, do you see what I see?

73
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:59,859
Look at their complexions,
they're green. What are they?

74
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,396
I don't know...

75
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,575
but if they were fish, the Board of
Health wouldn't let you sell them.

76
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,643
(Sergeant) Good evening,
what can I do for you?

77
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,206
Well, you can direct us to
the Lost and Found Department.

78
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,185
What did you lose, Pops,
your marbles? No.

79
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:20,156
We lost my husband and his
son-in-law, Herman Munster.

80
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,749
Alias John Doe.

81
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:23,819
A John Doe?

82
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:28,163
He's ours, and we want him back.
Why?

83
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,535
Officer Kugel, shut up
and bring in John Doe.

84
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,839
Now, you must remember
that amnesia is very delicate.

85
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:41,476
If you just tell the victim who he
is, like a bolt out of the blue...

86
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,845
you're liable to shock him
into a psychological trance.

87
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,817
So just wait for him
to recognize you.

88
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,444
Okay?
Okay,

89
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,585
Sergeant, do you know
how he got amnesia?

90
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,260
He got hit on the head
with a 300-pound safe.

91
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,622
I see.

92
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,065
Oh, hi.

93
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:09,566
John, this is Mrs. Munster,
and her father.

94
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,837
How do you do?
How do you do?

95
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,435
Hi, there.
Hi.

96
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,911
Do they look familiar?

97
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,511
I've never seen these
people before in my life.

98
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,179
[sighs]

99
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,886
Steady, Lily, be brave.

100
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,121
Are you sure?
I'm positive.

101
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:34,194
I'd remember a cute little
cookie like Mrs. Munster.

102
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,960
Okay, Kugel, take him back.

103
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,334
Shall we go?
Sure. Come on.

104
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,707
It's been very nice
meeting you.

105
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,138
Bye.

106
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:55,313
Did you ever hear the one about
the elephant and the peanut?

107
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,619
I'm sorry, folks. I know you'd
like to take him home with you...

108
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,594
but until he knows himself who he is, I
can't release him without a court order.

109
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,097
But he's my husband
and the father of our child.

110
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,866
We want him home
where he belongs.

111
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,034
Well, in view
of his condition...

112
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:17,234
you might try to petition the court
for legal custody of the victim.

113
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,777
Adoption approved.

114
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:32,252
Amy, you're a very lucky child to be
adopted by such wonderful parents.

115
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:35,018
I'm sure you'll be
a very happy family.

116
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,454
All right, bailiff,
next case, please.

117
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,329
Mrs. Lily Munster...

118
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,597
and John Doe.

119
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,372
Say, excuse me, I'm on.

120
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:58,575
Give him back his comic books.
That's all right, you can keep them.

121
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,950
What a nice kid.

122
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:05,922
Hello, there.

123
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,281
Good morning, Your Honor.

124
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,758
Good morn...

125
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,286
[clears throat]

126
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,829
Good morning.

127
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:19,035
This is the child?
Well, yes and no.

128
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,903
He's recovering
from an accident.

129
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,129
Oh.

130
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,277
Must have been a beauty.

131
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:29,938
Well, I've had people
adopt adults before...

132
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,350
but are you sure
you want to adopt him?

133
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,284
Yes, Your Honor, I am.

134
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:40,522
Yes, you see, Your Honor, she
believes that older children...

135
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,426
need love and guidance just
as much as younger ones do.

136
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:50,032
Just a minute, who are you? I'm
Mrs. Munster's trustworthy father.

137
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,893
[clears throat]

138
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,694
Wait a minute.

139
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:01,074
This isn't one of those
Candid Camera stunts, is it?

140
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,244
No, sir...

141
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,574
I don't think so.

142
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,153
Well, now,
Mrs. Munster, tell me...

143
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,780
have you given this
careful consideration?

144
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,826
Yes, Your Honor, I have.

145
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,892
And before you made
your final decision...

146
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:23,092
did you go to the orphanage and see what...
who else was available?

147
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,424
No.

148
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:28,133
No, I took one look
at John...

149
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,434
and I knew I couldn't
live without him.

150
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,509
Thanks, Mom.

151
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:41,046
John, tell me, have you
thought this thing out?

152
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:44,714
I mean, do you want to go home
with these people...

153
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,957
and become
a member of this family?

154
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,784
Can I have my own television set?
Of course, John.

155
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,490
You've got yourself a deal.

156

00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,697
[sighing]

312
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,334
Hey, kid, would you hold
this for me for a while?

313
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,047
Lily, my Lily...

314
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,346
my fragrant flower
of the Sahara.

315
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,382
Those limpid eyes...

316
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,620
those ruby lips
pleading to be--

317
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,923
[shouting]

318
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,796
Will you knock it off?
I'm sorry.

319
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:58,198
Well, you should be. Can't you
see that I'm about to propose?

320
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,203
Honest lnjun?

321
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,197
Mr. Smith wants
to be my new husband.

322
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,939
You see...

323
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,807
he wants me to stop carrying the
torch for my old husband...

324
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,504
Herman Munster.

325
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,378
Who?
Herman Munster.

326
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,750
She said, "Herman Munster."

327
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,326
Say, listen, can I play
with this up in my room?

328
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:30,128
Rudolph, may as well
forget it. It's no use.

329
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:33,726
Aunt Lily!
What's the matter, Marilyn?

330
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,171
It's Eddie. I just went up in the room
to tuck him in, and he wasn't there.

331
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,608
He'd opened the window, climbed out
on the roof to fly his new kite.

332
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:44,136
Darn Eddie. Why don't I get
to do neat stuff like that?

333
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:45,673
My baby!

334
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:46,977
My baby.

335
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,926
[exclaims]

336
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:04,025
Eddie, go inside!
Go inside!

337
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,659
(Marilyn)
He's going to fall!

338
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:09,262
Will you... Be careful, Eddie!
Stand back, just move back, Eddie!

339
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,830
Eddie, move back!

340
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,170
(Lily)
No!

341
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:21,415
Eddie, stand back! Your father
orders you to stand back!

342
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:34,662
Now, Eddie, that was
a very stupid thing to do.

343
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,793
Now, you go straight to bed and we'll
discuss your punishment tomorrow.

344
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,131
Yes, sir.

345
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,165
Eddie.

346
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,871
Now, you run along.

347
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:52,707
Marilyn, you should not be outside,
dear, without your sweater on.

348
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,341
You'll catch cold.

349
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,044
Yes, Uncle Herman.

350
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,451
Grandpa...

351
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,815
I wish you'd get out of that
cockamamie costume and that makeup...

352
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,860
before you embarrass us
in front of all our neighbors.

353
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,258
He's back.

354
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:08,994
Lily.
Yes, Herman.

355
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:13,766
Might I say, dear, that
you look especially lovely?

356
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,236
[chuckling]

357
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,701
Thank you, my darling husband.

358
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:26,911
What's this whip doing here? Has Eddie
been playing with some big boy?

359
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,418
Yes, Herman, one of
the nicest boys I know.

360
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:46,129
No television for a week?
That is correct.

361
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:49,068
Oh, Pop.
Now, Eddie, don't complain.

362
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:52,705
It's a small price to pay
for regaining your father.

363
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,404
Yeah, but I was having fun
with him as my brother.

364
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,538
Uncle Herman?
Yes, dear.

365
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:01,015
How would you describe the way
you got your memory back?

366
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,449
I'd say...

367
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:03,843
[clears throat]

368
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:08,483
I'd say that family, love, and
devotion are thicker than amnesia.

369
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:14,825
Herman, you phrased that beautifully.
Thank you.

370
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,324
I did, didn't I?

371
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:21,133
Where's Grandpa?
He's down in the dungeon.

372
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:25,231
He's been up all night trying
to invent another pill...

373
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,976
that will bring him
back to normal.

374
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,440
But he's still
having trouble.

375
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,448
Good morning.

376
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:42,315
Well, all right, I'll just
have a little breakfast now...

377
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,452
and then I'll go down
to the lab and try again.

378
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,325
That might be
a very good idea.

379
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,198
[snickering]

380
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,594
Say, Grandpa.
Yes?

381
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,636
What's new
with Marie Antoinette?

382
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,340
That's very funny.

383
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,113
Very funny.
