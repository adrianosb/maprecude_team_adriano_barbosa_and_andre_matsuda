is sitting at my table?

158
00:12:44,844 --> 00:12:47,244
I'm waiting
for breakfast.

159
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:50,874
Would you tell this person
that everybody who was
going to get breakfast...

160
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,818
already had breakfast.

161
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:57,515
Lily, I'm hungry!

162
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,686
Eh, as husband, father...

163
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:04,696
and head of the household,
I demand breakfast!

164
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:13,767
What's this?

165
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,240
Prune pits.
Three of them.

166
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:18,436
One for the father,
one for the husband...

167
00:13:18,511 --> 00:13:21,378
and one for
the head of the house.

168
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:23,381
Eh--

169
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:29,318
Grandpa,
what am I going to do?

170
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:32,323
I can't spend the rest
of my married life
sleeping on the couch...

171
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:34,325
and eating prune pits.

172
00:13:34,393 --> 00:13:38,557
Herman, if you give in now,
she'll have the upper hand forever.
[ Cackles ]

173
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:41,998
But, if you hold out,
she'll come around.

174
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:44,161
That's the way
to handle women! Mmm.

175
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:52,137
[ Crunching ]
What are you doing?

176
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:54,941
Well,just in case
she doesn't come around,

177
00:13:55,014 --> 00:13:58,177
I'm gonna get used
to eating prune pits.

178
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,461
Grandpa,

179
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:20,063
this is the fourth night
in a row I've slept down here!

180
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:22,073
When is Lily
gonna give in?

181
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:25,577
Herman, I hate to say it,
but I think we're licked.
[ Chuckles ]

182
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:29,638
I'm afraid you just don't have
the personality and warmth
you used to have.

183
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:31,649
In other words, my boy,

184
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:33,810
in that great furnace
known as romance,

185
00:14:33,886 --> 00:14:36,878
your pilot light
has gone out.

186
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:41,120
Grandpa, you certainly have
a way with words.
Thank you.

187
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:43,754
But how am I gonna
turn up the burner?

188
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:45,763
Wait. I think
I have the answer.

189
00:14:45,831 --> 00:14:47,799
Here.

190
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:49,801
Read this.

191
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:51,803
""Is your marriage shaky?

192
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:53,805
""Headed for the rocks?

193
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:57,036
""See Dr. Harvey Baxter, M.C.,
Marriage Counselor.

194
00:14:57,109 --> 00:14:59,236
Broken hearts made whole.''

195
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:03,806
Ah, Grandpa.
Me go to a marriage counselor?
[ Chuckles ]

196
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:08,149
Marilyn, me go
to a marriage counselor?

197
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:12,783
Yes. Well, you and Uncle Herman
are getting farther apart every day.

198
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:15,383
And neither of you
are going to give in.

199
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:19,488
I think it's the only solution.
[ Scoffs ]
I wouldn't know who to go to.

200
00:15:19,565 --> 00:15:22,466
Well, Aunt Lily, I read an ad
in the paper this morning,

201
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:25,868
and so I called and I made
an appointment for you
for tomorrow.

202
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:28,998
The man's name
is Dr. Harvey Baxter.

203
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:35,236
All right, I'll try...
on one condition--

204
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:37,874
that your Uncle Herman
never knows.

205
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:46,221
Now, as I was saying,
my name is Mrs. Mu--
No names, please.

206
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:49,784
I find that people
are less inhibited
if they remain anonymous.

207
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:53,298
Now then,
what is your problem?

208
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:56,028
Well, to begin with, Doctor,
I'm married.

209
00:15:56,102 --> 00:15:58,093
Don't be ashamed of it.

210
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,695
Virtually every person
who's walked through that door...

211
00:16:00,773 --> 00:16:03,606
has made
the same mistake.

212
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:05,667
Now, tell me something
about your background.

213
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:09,078
- For instance, where were you born?
- Transylvania.

214
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:12,580
My father is a count.

215
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:14,586
And your husband?
No count.

216
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:18,719
Uh, bitterness
is not the answer.

217
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,759
I meant, where was he born?

218
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:24,728
Oh, my husband
was made, Doctor, not born.

219
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:28,028
Oh, oh, yes, of course.
That's, that's fine.

220
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,729
Every woman should think
her husband is a self-made man.

221
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:34,238
Oh, he had help.

222
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:37,105
Now, madam, tell me,

223
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:39,110
is there another woman?

224
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:42,545
No, the doctor quit after Herman.

225
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:48,145
Well, e-exactly what is
the cause of your domestic trouble?

226
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,087
Well, it all started
down at his place
of employment.

227
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:53,625
Ah, that is a familiar complaint.

228
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:56,127
The wife neglected for the job.

229
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:58,959
I suppose he just
buries himself in his work.

230
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:01,693
Oh, no, no. Not Herman.

231
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:04,634
Although there have been
a few close calls.

232
00:17:04,704 --> 00:17:07,229
You see, Doctor,
the trouble started...

233
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:11,504
when they had this party
down at the office.

234
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:14,341
He didn't get home
until after 1 2:00.

235
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:19,282
Aha! This is
an old story to me.

236
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:22,082
Ah, the gay playboy husband.

237
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:25,180
But, fortunately,
there is an easy solution.

238
00:17:25,257 --> 00:17:28,749
You must go home
and apologize immediately.

239
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:32,824
Me, apologize?

240
00:17:32,898 --> 00:17:36,698
I'm not the one who came home
in the middle of the night
and sang ""doo-dah, doo-dah''...

241
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:38,999
through the keyhole.

242
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:43,599
If you take the first step,
it will put the burden
squarely on his shoulders,

243
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:48,340
and he will realize
what a loving, forgiving wife you are.

244
00:17:48,414 --> 00:17:52,248
Well, I'll try it.

245
00:17:52,318 --> 00:17:56,049
But, remember,
you must assume
the role of peacemaker...

246
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:58,784
and be the first
to forgive and forget.

247
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:08,666
Uh, Doctor,
I think your secretary's
taking a sunbath.

248
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:11,862
Uh, she jumped out the window
and ran up the fire escape
to the roof.

249
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:19,543
Good heavens, man,
what happened to you?

250
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:23,275
Well, you see, my wife
and I have had a fight.

251
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:25,817
You-- You should have
defended yourself, man.

252
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:30,288
No one should stand still
and take a beating like that.
Nobody hit me.

253
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:33,587
You mean there's been
no physical violence?

254
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:37,390
No, Doctor. My problems
are purely emotional.

255
00:18:37,463 --> 00:18:40,432
Yes. Yes, that's obvious.

256
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:43,366
Sit down.
Oh, thank you.

257
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,737
Now, uh, let's begin
at the beginning.

258
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:52,141
Well, my wife has locked me
out of the bedroom...

259
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:54,145
and won't let me in.

260
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:57,740
Naturally. But has she
done anything unusual?

261
00:18:57,817 --> 00:19:00,445
U-Uh, no, you don't
understand, Doctor.

262
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:03,886
She's not only locked me out
of the bedroom,
she won't feed me.

263
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:06,083
Eh, she won't even
speak to me.

264
00:19:06,158 --> 00:19:08,888
What was the cause
of the quarrel?

265
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:11,896
Oh. Well, a few evenings ago...

266
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:14,296
I stayed out rather late...

267
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:16,425
for business reasons.

268
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:19,699
Uh, when I got home,
my wife was disturbed.

269
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:21,706
She rejected me...

270
00:19:21,774 --> 00:19:24,299
and made me sleep
downstairs on the couch.

271
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:26,810
And, Doctor,

272
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:30,815
for the last four days,
the only thing I've had
my arms around...

273
00:19:30,883 --> 00:19:32,976
is a Woof-Woof.

274
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:40,117
My advice to you is this--
that you go home at once
and apologize.

275
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:43,093
- Apologize?
- Exactly.

276
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:47,792
At any cost you must be the one
to take the first step toward reconciliation.

277
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,596
Do not allow your wife...

278
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:52,603
to assume
the role of peacemaker.

279
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:10,245
Lily, I want to talk to you.

280
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:12,256
And I want to talk
to you too, darling.

281
00:20:12,324 --> 00:20:14,349
There's something
I want to tell you, dear.

282
00:20:14,426 --> 00:20:17,691
Oh, I'll be glad to listen,
but I want to tell you
something first.

283
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:20,231
Uh, Lily, dear,
if you don't mind,

284
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:24,429
could I tell you what I want
to tell you before you tell me
what you want to tell me?

285
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:27,700
Eh-Eh, no, dear.
You let me go first,

286
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:30,401
because what I have to say
will save our marriage.

287
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:32,967
Uh, Lily, if anyone's gonna
save our marriage,

288
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:34,979
I'm gonna save our marriage.

289
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:37,572
Oh, no you're not.
Lily,

290
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,450
all I'm trying to do
is say I'm sorry and apologize.

291
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,956
You apologize?
B-But you can't apologize to me...

292
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:47,151
before I have a chance
to apologize to you.

293
00:20:47,226 --> 00:20:50,127
Lily, all I want to be
is the peacemaker.

294
00:20:50,195 --> 00:20:53,392
You the peacemaker?
Oh, you big dummy!

295
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:56,992
I'm going to be the peacemaker,
so get that through your thick head!

296
00:20:57,069 --> 00:21:00,800
Lily, will you pipe down
while I'm trying to be sweet
and apologize?

297
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:02,807
Ooh. That does it!

298
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,537
I'm not gonna sit around here
a-and be apologized to...

299
00:21:05,611 --> 00:21:07,875
by a poor insensitive oaf!.

300
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:10,541
Lily! Lily!

301
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:12,550

302
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:15,553
Lily!

303
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:17,851
I-I'm sleeping
in our bed tonight.

304
00:21:17,923 --> 00:21:20,687
I am! I am! I am!
I am! I am! I am!

305
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:25,228
[ Whimpers ]
Fiddlesticks!

306
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:32,503
Oh.

307
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:36,007
Thank you, son.

308
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:44,947
Oh, Grandpa, why do you
keep fooling around with that...

309
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:47,281
when we have such
a serious problem
on our hands?

310
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:51,414
[ Chuckles ]
Because, my dear, this
is going to solve the problem.

311
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,926
This is a formula
for instant measles.

312
00:21:54,994 --> 00:21:57,827
Wait a minute.
Who's gonna have the measles?

313
00:21:57,896 --> 00:22:00,228
You are.
But they're synthetic.

314
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:02,267
No fever. No scratching.

315
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:05,269
Just two happy parents reunited.

316
00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:08,397
? Dee-da, da-da, la-da ??

317
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:11,466
Okay, Eddie, there you go.
You mean I have
to drink this stuff?

318
00:22:11,543 --> 00:22:14,171
Drink it?
[ Chuckles ]
What do you mean, drink it?

319
00:22:14,246 --> 00:22:17,409
?? [ Humming ]

320
00:22:19,284 --> 00:22:21,650
- Do you think that'll work?
- Certainly.

321
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,950
When Herman and Lily
think their little boy is sick,

322
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:26,821
they'll be so worried
it'll bring them back together.

323
00:22:26,892 --> 00:22:29,690
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, Grandpa,
you're a psychologist.

324
00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:34,426
No, I'm not. It's a trick
I learned from watching
old Shirley Temple movies.

325
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:45,641
Herman!
Herman, come quickly!

326
00:22:45,711 --> 00:22:47,770
It's Eddie!

327
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:51,907
[ Footsteps Approaching ]
Coming, dear.! Coming.!

328
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:54,214
Lily! Lily! Lily!

329
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:56,948
Lily, what is it!?
Oh, I brought him in here, Herman.

330
00:22:57,022 --> 00:23:00,355
Look!
Now, Lily, dear, don't panic.
Herman's here.

331
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:04,362
We'll think
of something... together.
Oh, but look at his face.

332
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:11,128
[ Crashes ]

333
00:23:11,203 --> 00:23:13,296
Ooh. Oh, Herman.

334
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:17,502
Oh, you're so kind and sweet
and precious and adorable.

335
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:20,875
And-And sometimes
you're a goofball,
but I love you.

336
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:25,576
Oh, Lily,

337
00:23:25,651 --> 00:23:27,585
say that again.

338
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:30,679
U-Uh, um, but this time, dear,
leave out ""goofball.''

339
00:23:44,303 --> 00:23:47,500
It is wonderful--
one minute alone
with Grandpa...

340
00:23:47,573 --> 00:23:50,440
and his measles disappeared.

341
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:53,706
Not one single mark
on that sweet little face.

342
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:55,713
Oh, it's miraculous.

343
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:57,715
No, Lily,
I understand it perfectly.

344
00:23:57,783 --> 00:23:59,842
Eddie's measles
were psychosomatic--

345
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:03,183
the result of worrying
about us quarreling.

346
00:24:03,255 --> 00:24:06,053
[ Chuckles ]
Well, he'll never have to
worry about that again,

347
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,059
will he, pussycat?

348
00:24:08,127 --> 00:24:11,790
Never! No more
office parties for me.

349
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:15,800
From now on, I'm having
all my fun right here at home!

350

? Camptown ladies sing this song ?

353

? Doo-dah, doo-dah ?

? Gwine to run all day?

358

a bobtail nag ?

? Somebody bet on the bay??
