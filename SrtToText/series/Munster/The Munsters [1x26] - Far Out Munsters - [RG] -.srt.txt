You know, Lily,
it's very nice to relax
after supper.
[Chuckles]
Did you have a hard day
at the parlor, dear?
Did I? People were
in and out all day.
Eh, don't complain, Herman.
You should be grateful
you've got a going business.
[Clattering]
What is it
you've got there, Herman?
Popcorn.
L-I thought I'd make some...
and sort of
keep things jumping.
[Eddie] Now you stay there, Spot,
and be a good boy.
[Footsteps Pounding]
[Spot Growling]
Hey, Dad, I got
a new record today.
Is it okay if I play it
on the phonograph?
Why, of course, Eddie.
I think it's very nice
for a young boy to be
interested in music.
[Chuckling]
You know, Eddie,
back in the Old Country,
you couldn't keep me away
from good music.
Hmm! Why, I used to haunt
the opera house night and day.
Turn the horn around, Eddie,
so that we can all hear it.
Huh.
?? [Rock And Roll Blaring]
[Growls]
- [Gulps]
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Yelling, Drowned Out By Music]
But, Pop,
they're The Standells.
Every kid in school
is crazy about 'em.
And they're coming to town
for a concert.
Boy, I'd give anything
to meet 'em face-to-face.
Whew, Eddie...
[Sighs]
We can all be thankful
that that will never happen.
Okay, okay, Pops.
So we're picking up 8,000
for a one-night stand in this town.
We don't want
to get stomped to death.
Yeah, that last hotel was too much
with those 2,000 screaming kids
in the lobby.
Look, why don't you rent us
a mansion with a couple
of swimming pools.
Like you did
in Beverly Hills.
You guys wrecked
the last two places like that...
cost us $15,000 damages.
Well, then get us a place
on the outskirts,
one we can't hurt.
Hey, that's a good idea.
Right on.
Yeah. Well, all right.
All right.
I've got a real estate
agent working on it,
and he's spotted a place.
"1313 Mockingbird Lane."
It's owned by some people
named, uh, "Munster."
I'm going out there now
and try to make a deal.
Yeah, when those Munsters find out
what we're willing to pay,
they'll practically fall over dead.
It's nice you're interested
in our house, Mr. Murdock,
but it simply isn't for rent.
But it would be just right
for these, uh, friends of mine.
And I'm prepared to make
a very attractive offer.
Oh, but my aunt and uncle
are out right now,
and Grandfather's up in the attic.
Oh, uh, working?
Oh, no. He just likes
to hang around up there.
I only want to
rent the place for my clients
for the weekend.
And we're prepared
to pay $500.
Well, I really don't believe
they'd consider renting it.
Are you sure
you heard me right, miss?
I said $1,500 for a weekend.
Oh, well, that's very generous,
but they're very touchy
about having strangers
in the house.
In all the years
that we've lived here,
I can't recall more
than eight or nine people
ever getting past the front door.
Yes. Well, uh, you folks
think it over.
And have your aunt
or uncle call me, huh?
Here's my card.
Oh, thank you.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Even my boys
couldn't hurt this dump.
This Mr. Murdock seemed
very anxious to rent the place.
But $1,500,
just for the weekend?
[Scoffs]
Must be some congressman here
on government business.
Mm-hmm.
I don't think so.
He called back three times.
And he said he'd even
put us all up at a hotel
if we'd rent the place.
But we don't even know
who the man represents.
L-I mean, what would
the neighbors think...
if they saw a bunch of
strange-looking people
living in our home?
Grandpa, we could
use the money.
We still owe that bill
to the vet...
from the last time
you went out prowling
a-and caught distemper.
Grandpa, if you'd taken
your shots when I told you to,
you could have
saved us $400.
Hey, Mom,
if we do rent the place,
could I use some of the money
to buy Spot a new toy?
Oh, Eddie, we gave him
a foreign sports car for Christmas.
He played with it
a couple of times,
and then he threw it
over the back fence.
Uncle Herman,
what should I tell the man
if he calls back again?
Marilyn, dear,
I've thought the thing over
from all angles,
and I have come
to a conclusion.
We will accept
the man's offer.
That is my decision
as head of the house.
[Chuckles]
[Clears Throat]
That's all right with you,
isn't it, pussycat?
Oh, uh, Lily,
I'm gonna leave the key
under the mat, dear,
for our temporary tenants.
We don't want any burglars
getting in here.
Eh, Herman, how are
our tenants going to know...
that the key is
under the mat?
Please, Grandpa,
I've taken care of everything.
I hope those tenants
don't ruin our beautiful yard.
Oh, dear, yes.
It's taken us years
to get it in this condition.
Lily, I've taken care
of that too, dear.
Wait a minute!
I forgot to say
good-bye to Spot.
[Groans]
Good-bye, Spot!
[Spot Growls]
We're leaving now, Spot!
[Growling Continues]
Now, you be a good boy
while we're gone.
[Growls]
He's a good fellow,
isn't he?
[Laughing, Grunting]
[Car Door Shuts, Engine Starts]
What is that?
You got me.
Since when has the morgue
been giving curb service?
Grandpa, Lily, Marilyn,
you go on in and register.
I'll park the car.
There's a sign...
underground garage.
Underground?
Herman, let me go with you.
I might run into
a few old friends.
No, Grandpa.
You go on in with the girls
and keep an eye on them.
There are lots of
fresh traveling salesmen
in hotel lobbies.
May I?
Yeah, here.
[Grunts] What do you got in here?
Just my father's
extra pair of shoes.
Hey, guys,
what do you think
of this coop?
Reminds me of
the converted car barn
we played in San Francisco.
[Igor Squeaking]
Hey...
- What was that?
- Well, it was no swallow from Capistrano.
Hey, look at this thing.
?? [Organ Notes Honk]
That's crazy, man.
You can see the notes
while you play 'em.
Hey, dig this lopsided "geetar."
Wow.
Wow.
?? [Harp Note Sounds]
That's swing.
[All Laughing]
Hey, guys, you know what?
This calls for a party.
That's a good idea.
Let's get on the horn
and call us up some playmates.
Now you're talking!
Eh, say, uh,
what's this thing?
Uh, that's the air conditioner, sir.
Well, turn it on.
The air seems
awfully fresh in here.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Mom, can I go out
and walk around the ledge?
Oh, no. No, Eddie.
You might fall off
and hurt somebody.
Now you go right in, Eddie,
and get ready for bed.
[Sighs]
No dust!
And at these prices too!
[Clears Throat]
Uh, uh, Grandpa,
the bellboy is
holding out his hand.
What for?
You're supposed
to grease his palm.
Oh!
[Chuckling]
I'm sorry.
Where were you, Herman?
Oh, Lily, I had
a terrible time parking.
Yeah. You know,
I think this hotel
is having labor trouble.
Just as I drove in
their underground garage,
the attendant quit.
What kind
of a dump is this?
Mom,
I don't think I can sleep
in that creepy bed.
Could I sleep
in the dresser drawer?
At least it has handles on it.
We'll see, Eddie.
Oh, Herman,
I don't know
about this place.
I wish we were back
in our own cozy little house...
enjoying a nice, quiet evening.
[Sighs]
[Chattering]
The Smith Brothers have arrived!
Sorry to hear about that eye.
[Chattering Continues]
[Man]
Hey, sweetheart...
[Continues, Indistinct]
Hey, Tony, Nick,
the P.T.A. Have arrived!
Come on in.
Oh, Herman, I thought
we were going to spend...
an enjoyable weekend
away from home,
but nothing has worked out.
I agree, dear.
I think it's ridiculous...
to put up
with all these hardships
and inconveniences.
But how can we go home?
We signed that lease.
Oh, I don't care if we did.
We'll just ask them
to leave.
I'm with you all the way, dear.
Eh, but will you
do the talking?
All right.
Oh, Marilyn,
will you get Grandpa
so we can get going?
Come on, Grandpa.
I'll be right
with you.
?? [Rock And Roll]
? Everybody we know?
? I'm gonna set you straight
This dance is great?
Herman, look at all the cars.
What's going on here?
And look at the house.
It's all lit up.
Yes, it sure gives it
an eerie effect.
Listen! I hear music.
Those people
who rented our house
are throwing a party.
Lily, let's go back
to the hotel.
[Engine Starts]
Herman, Herman, no, no.
We'll do no such thing.
That is our house,
and those people are throwing
a wild party.
Now you, as head of the family,
will go right in there
and demand that they leave!
? I'm gonna set you straight
This dance is great?
? Come on and Ringo?
Go ahead and knock.
All right.
[Thunderous Knocking]
Eh, look here, l...
Come on in.
Hey, Zeno,
some cats from L.A. Just...
blew in.
Look, you don't understand.
We...
Go on in and mingle, doll!
Come on in.
We don't know anybody either.
? Everybody Ringo?
? I'm gonna set you straight
This dance is great?
? Come on and Ringo?
Did you dig that crazy getup?
Man, is that way out!
Did you see the hairdo
on the tall one?
It's the greatest thing
since Carl Sandburg.
? Energy to do this dance for you?
? We showed you how to Ringo?
? Come on and let yourself go?
? Everybody Ringo?
? I'm gonna set you straight?
? This dance is great
Come on and Ringo?
? Come on and Ringo
Come on and Ringo?
? Come on and Ringo?
? Yeah, yeah?
? Yeah, yeah?
? Yeah, yeah, yeah?
? Yeah, yeah, yeah?

[Cheering]
Herman, say something.
Pardon me, young man,
but do you think I could...
Uh, just cool it, man.
You'll get your chance.
?? [Music Resumes:
"I Want to Hold Your Hand'"]
? Oh, yeah, I'll tell you something?
? I think you'll understand?
Hey, Dad, those neat guys
are The Standells!
? When I say that something?
? I want to hold your hand?
[Gasps] You mean those are
the people who rented our house?
? I want to hold your hand?
? I want to hold your hand?
? Oh, please, say to me?
? You'll let me be your man?
? And, please, say to me?
? You'll let me hold your hand?
? I want to hold your hand?
? I want to hold your hand?
You know, Herman...
? And when I touch you?
They do have a certain... style.
? I feel happy?
Yes. They are rather razzmatazz.
? Inside?
? It's such a feeling that my love?
You know, they're almost
as good as Kate Smith.
? I can't hide.! I can't hide?
? I can't hide?
? Yeah, you've got that something?
? I think you'll understand?
? When I say that something?
? I want to hold your hand?
? I want to hold your hand?
? I want to hold your hand?
Grandpa, doesn't that
send you out of this world?
? And when I touch you?
? I feel happy inside?
So what?
I've been there before.
? It's such a feeling that my love?
? I can't hide.! I can't hide?
? I can't hide?
? Yeah, you've got that something?
Sweetheart, you're not a bit
like the rest of your group.
Yes, I know.
I'm the plain one
in the family.
? When I say that something?
? I want to hold your hand?
? I want to hold your hand?
[Mouthing Words]
? I want to hold your hand?
? I want to hold your hand??
[Cheering]
[Boat Whistle]
[Cheering Continues]
Cool it!
Cool it, everybody!
Cool it! Cool it!
The hermit's gonna groove us!
[Cheering]
This reminds me
of that wild party at Mayerling...
just before the grand duke
went upstairs
and blew his brains out.
?? [Drumming]
In the vortex of the future...
of that cool tomorrow land,
?? [Drumming Continues]
We'll all wig there,
play a gig there
in that great nonunion band.
Scuba doo...
and scuba dabba.
Life's a gas,
and life's a grabba.
Hip is hip,
and groove is groovy.
Life's a wild Fellini movie.
When that hairy fist of silence...
slugs us, bugs us,
puts us down...
Hmm. We'll all wing it,
we'll all sing it:
"Guy Lombardo's back in town."
[Cheering]
Oh, that guy sure cuts away
the tinsel, don't he?
Oh, Grandpa, isn't this
a fun party?
Yes, I haven't seen
so many good-looking people...
in one place
since we closed down
the mausoleum back home.
Let's hear from
theJolly Green Giant!
Yeah! Come on, Herman!
[Crowd Cheering]
O-Oh, oh, no.
Not me.
[Cheering, Chattering]
Oh, dear, I think
he's going to recite.
[Sighs]
[Clears Throat]
Um...
?? [Drumming]
Ibbity bibbity sibbity sab.
L-Ibbity bibbity canal boat.
Dictionary...
down the ferry.
Mary, Mary, quite contrary.
?? [Drumming Continues]
[Sighs]
Um, Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear.
Fuzzy Wuzzy lost his hair.
S-Scuba doo and scuba die.
That chicken's not
too young to fry.
L-Life is real, life is earnest.
If you're cold, turn up the furnace.
Th... l-I thank you.
[Cheering]
[Boat Whistle]
Man, that cat is deep.
Yeah, what a message.
And now we have
a rare treat in store for you.
A truly great talent,
and a member
of my own family.
I would like to present
to you, group,
that swinging chick
from Transylvania, my wife.!
Eh, let's all hear it for Lily!
Go ahead, Aunt Lily.
Don't be shy.
[Chuckles]
Cats, you ain't heard nothin' yet!
Get a load of this cat...
you'd think he owned the place.
Thank you, pussycat.
?? [Harp]
? He's goin'?
? He's goin' away?
? For to stay?
? A little while?
? But he's comin' back?
? If he goes?
? 10,000 miles?
? Oh, who will tie?
? My shoe?
? And who will comb?
? My hair?
? And who will kiss?
? My ruby lips?
? When he is gone?
? Look away?
? Look away?
? Over Yandro?
? Oh, brother will tie?
? My shoe?
? And sister will comb?
? My hair?
? And you will kiss?
? My ruby lips?
? When you?
? Come home?
? Look away?
? Look away?
? Over Yandro??
[Cheering]
Well, good night, fellas.
Oh, listen.
Good night.
If your act ever dies,
give me a call
at the parlor.
Ah.
So long.
We really dig you people!
And someday
we'll return the favor.
Bye.
Bye.
So long.
[Door Creaking]
[Door Closes]
Look, Pop,
I got their autograph.
"To Eddie Munster,
a real gone gasser.
Sincerely, The Standells."
Huh! Well, isn't that nice, Eddie?
You know, Lily,
I'm gonna sleep
a lot better tonight, dear,
knowing that
the future of America...
is in the hands
of boys like these.
Good morning, everybody.
Good morning, Grandpa.
Good morning.
Oh, what an evening.
You know, I fell asleep
the moment my head
hit the slab.
You're a little late
this morning, Grandpa.
Let me heat up your coffee.
It's all right, Lily.
I'll take care of it.
[Sizzling]
Well, Uncle Herman,
we certainly had a lot
of fun last night, didn't we?
We certainly did, dear.
But you know something, Marilyn?
It's nice just to be
the plain old Munsters again.
[Chuckling]
And go back to normal living.
Oh, you're so right, Herman.
[Clattering]
Good morning, dear.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Morning, Eddie.
