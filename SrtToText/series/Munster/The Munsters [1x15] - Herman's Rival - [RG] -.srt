It's a disaster.
Well, what's wrong, Aunt Lily?

Uncle Herman?
I can't believe it.

10
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:43,514
Down through history
this only happened once before
in our family...

11
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,354
when Grandpa overdrew
his account at the blood bank.

12
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:48,656
Did Uncle Herman
say anything about this?

13
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:50,697
Oh, no. He's too proud.

14
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:53,255
Why, if he found out
that we knew he was broke,

15
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,801
he'd never be able to
look himself in the face again.

Well, maybe Grandpa could
help us out. He's very well off.

He was. He was.
But you know the expression
"You can't take it with you"?

18
00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:05,236
Well, Grandpa did.

19
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:10,282
The only trouble was...

20
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,341
he forgot to bring it back.

21
00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:22,379
Herman, say it isn't so.
Say I heard you wrong.

Grandpa, you heard me right.

23
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:28,520
Ah, I lent $5,000 to Lester.

There. Put in that stuff
in... in the blue beaker first.

30
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:53,846
Yeah. And then that little jar
with the green stuff.

31
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:58,222
Yeah. And... And then that...
that yellow stuff in the beaker.

32
00:02:59,526 --> 00:03:04,429
A-And top it off
with that white stuff...

do you think Lester would
lose that money?

00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:38,387
It was an investment.
H-He said it was a sure thing.

fill a position like that...

Now, I'll be home
before your Uncle Herman.

if Uncle Herman knew
you were working for a man,

00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:13,188
don't you think
he'd hit the ceiling?

No, no.
He doesn't do that anymore.

121

I thought you just left

I did, but things are
awfully quiet down there.

going to tell you about this,

but I think it's best for all concerned
that it be brought out into the open.

Now, I've been watching Lily
for the past few days.

until just before you come in.

Uh... Uh... Uh, where does she go?

Well, that's just it.
She doesn't say.

143

Well, she's probably just
going shopping or something.

something was wrong,

That's just what I'm doing.

00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:24,726
What's your plan?
Right.

154
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:28,961
Tomorrow morning
you leave for work just as usual.

155
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:32,163
And then I will be able
to go down outside...

156
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:01,958
Grandpa. Uh, uh, uh,
she just went by.

157
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:05,227
I know. I saw her.

158
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:17,476
Good morning, Ramon.
Buenos días, señora.

159
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:35,760
Herman, your wife just
went into that tearoom
with a man.

160
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:39,066
I know.
Doesn't that
strike you as strange?

161
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:43,065
Yes, it does.
She's never been a tea drinker.

162
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:47,078
Herman,
let's you and I sit down here
and have a little talk.

163
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:57,816
You know, Lily,
I can't tell you how pleased
my wife and I are...

164
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,983
at the way
you've been reading palms.

165
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:04,428
Oh, thank you.
You've both been so kind to me.
[Metal Clanking]

166
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:15,203
Look at that manhole cover.

167
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:17,469
I never saw that happen before.

168
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:20,979
I hope there's nothing down in there
getting ready to explode.

169
00:13:25,518 --> 00:13:28,146
Lily, things are a little slow today.

170
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:32,351
I thought maybe if the passersby
saw you sitting here in the window
reading my husband's palm,

171
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:34,393
we might stir up a little action.

172
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,918
I'd be glad to.
I'll get you some hot tea.

173
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:43,958
Well, 20 years in the tearoom business
and I've never had my palm read. Huh?

174
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:46,231
Oh.
[Chuckles]
Well, now.

175
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:48,296
Let me see.

176
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,148
Can you see her?

177
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:06,623
Yeah. I can see her.

178
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:08,455
Can you see what they're doing?

179
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:10,860
Yes, I can see what they're doing.

180
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,831
- They're holding hands.
- Why would they be doing that?

181
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,303
Well, l... I don't think
they're exchanging fraternity grips.

182
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:23,003
I always like to check both hands.

183
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:25,771
Can you see
what they're doing now?

184
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:28,473
He's holding both her hands.

185
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:36,786
Grandpa. Uh... Uh, you...
you know something?

186
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:41,054
- What?
- They don't even have any tea on the table.

187
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:44,892
I've seen enough.
Let's get out of here.

188
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:46,955
It's okay with me.

189
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:51,331
[Crash]

190
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:55,033
What was that?
Uh, perhaps something did explode.

191
00:14:57,343 --> 00:14:59,834
What did you have to
go and do that for?

192
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:09,250
Herman, this is no time
to be writing a letter to Dear Abby.

193
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:13,953
That tearoom Casanova
is moving in on your wife.

194
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:17,723
Uh... Uh... Grandpa,
let's keep a cool head.

195
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,770
It's just that I want to
give Lily a chance to come to me
and explain the whole story.

196
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,366
Uncle Herman,
you're here.

197
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:32,434
Yes, I'm here.
Why shouldn't I be?

198
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:35,173
Uh, this is still my house,
isn't it?

199
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:38,308
Yes, but I'm surprised to see you.

200
00:15:38,384 --> 00:15:40,352
Oh, by the way,
Uncle Lester called,

201
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:42,614
and he's very anxious
to get in touch with you.

202
00:15:42,688 --> 00:15:48,649
Oh? Uh, it's probably
about the, uh, m-o-n-e-y.

203
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:52,459
Uh, Marilyn, dear, we have
a more important matter
to discuss right now.

204
00:15:52,531 --> 00:15:54,465
Uh, I'll talk to
Cousin Lester later.

205
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,558
[Door Opens]

206
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:00,562
Oh.
Aunt Lily.

207
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,805
Hello, Marilyn. Oh, I was so afraid
I wouldn't get home before Herman
that I practically ra...

Oh.

Well, hello, dear.

00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:16,083
Can you spare it?

211
00:16:16,155 --> 00:16:18,146
Uh, aren't you home rather early?

212
00:16:18,224 --> 00:16:21,682
Uh, husbands are
apt to do that occasionally.

213

Come home unexpectedly.

214
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:28,830
Can I make a cup of tea for anybody?

215
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:30,892
Uh, Grandpa,
why don't you relax?

216
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,370
I'll go in right now
and fix some supper.

217
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:35,600
Uh, Lily.
Yes, Herman?

218
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:38,769
Uh, Lily, I'm not one to pry,

219
00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:41,108
but I was just wondering
where you've been today.

220
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,977
Who, me?

221
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:46,678
Oh, well,
I just went downtown... shopping.

222
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:50,745
Oh, shopping.
Uh, did you see anything you liked?

223
00:16:50,823 --> 00:16:55,817
Oh, my, yes. At this time of the year
there are all kinds of goodies
to catch a girl's eye.

224
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:59,092
[Clears Throat]
Well, I was just, uh...

225
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:02,293
I was just wondering if you did
anything unusual today.

226
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:07,431
No. No, I didn't do anything today
that I haven't done every day
for the past two weeks.

227
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:09,633
Come on, Marilyn.

228
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:16,177
Well, that does it.
I'm going right down
to that tearoom...

229
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:18,614
and have it out
with that home-wrecker
face-to-face.

230
00:17:18,684 --> 00:17:22,415
Good boy.
Uh, but there's just
one thing, Grandpa.

231
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:24,513
This may lead to bloodshed.

232
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:28,287
Ooh, Herman.
This is no time to be looking
at the bright side.

233
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:30,522
Get down there.

Uh, just a moment.

236
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:26,108
Aunt Lily,
Cousin Lester's on the phone.

237
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:30,546
I wonder what he wants.

238
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,385
I haven't heard from him
since the last time
he went bankrupt.

239
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:40,721
Hello.
Lily, this is your brother, Lester.
Is Herman there?

240
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,598
No. He... He just went out
for a little walk.

241
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:46,297
Well, I guess it's all right
to tell you now, Lily.

242
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:49,341
A while back
Herman loaned me $5,000.

243
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:54,107
And now a big deal
has come through for me,
so I have the money to pay him back.

244
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,978
Herman loaned you $5,000?

245
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:00,018
That's right.
I'm coming right over there
with the money now.

246
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:02,076
Uh...

247
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:07,089
So that's why
our bank account is empty.

248
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:10,493
I'm gonna tell Grandpa.

249
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,897

I'm busy down in the lab.!

250
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:25,273
Well, drop whatever you're doing
and come on up here.

[Explosion]

252
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:35,379
And so, thinking that
Herman was broke, I got this job
reading palms in the tearoom.

00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:39,220
[Chuckles]
So that accounts for that fellow
we saw holding your hand.

00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,282
Right.
[Laughs]

255
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,454
And all the time I was just
reading his palm.

00:19:46,732 --> 00:19:48,723
Oh, the joke is on us.

257
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:54,069
Oh, no.
What's the matter,
Grandpa?

258
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:58,838
Herman is on his way over
to have it out with that fellow
you worked for.

00:19:58,911 --> 00:20:02,847
Oh, that's terrible.

and warn him.

to do what?

about a thing.

Well, he said
not to worry about a thing,
