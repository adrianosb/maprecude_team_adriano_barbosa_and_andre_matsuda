- Hello, mister.

4
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:26,797
Oh! Hi there, young fella.

5
00:00:26,873 --> 00:00:28,841
Is that some sort of game
you're playing?

6
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:32,276
No, it's not a game.
I've got my head stuck in here.

7
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:37,010
Oh, my. Well, uh, in that case,
you should summon assistance.

8
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:40,485
- Huh?
- You know, call for help.

9
00:00:40,554 --> 00:00:43,887
But I don't wanna do that,
'cause people would come
and laugh at me.

10
00:00:43,957 --> 00:00:48,155
And then my parents would find out
and yell at me for being dumb.

11
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:50,458
Oh, yeah, I know.

12
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,794
That can be annoying.

13
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:54,800
Allow me.

14
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:10,650
There you go.
Golly!

15
00:01:10,717 --> 00:01:14,847
That was real neat.
You must be the strongest guy
in the whole world.

16
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:19,881
Well, with the possible exception
of Li'I Abner.

17
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,656
- What's your name?
- Uh, my name's Mr. Munster.

18
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:25,596
But you can call me Uncle Herman.

19
00:01:25,665 --> 00:01:29,465
My name is Galen Livingston Stewart,
but you may call me Gale.

20
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:33,097
Oh, thank you.
Pleased to meet you, Gale.

21
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:36,641
It's been a pleasure
saving your life.

22
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,873
Do you come by here every day?
Yes, I do.

23
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:43,541
- Maybe I'll see you tomorrow.
- Oh, that would be real boss.

24
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:48,120
Uh, that means "keen."

25
00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:51,521
I just can't wait to tell my parents
about you, Uncle Herman. Good-bye.

26
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:53,525
Good-bye.

27
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:05,892
So, uh, Eddie,
I said to Queen Isabella,

28
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:08,230
"Why not give
this Columbus cat the jewels?

29
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:12,101
"I mean, after all,
they're not doing anyone any good
lying around in the top drawer.

30
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:15,972
And besides, he might take a cruise
and find something good."

31
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:19,637
And that, Eddie, is how
Columbus discovered America.

32
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:22,841
Gee, Grandpa, you've had
a lot of neat adventures.

33
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:26,511
Oh, yes, Eddie,
over the centuries,
you can say I got around.

34
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:29,646
A very interesting thing
happened to me on the way home
from work today.

35
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:33,056
Oh, that's fine.
Eddie, Eddie, don't just sit there.

36
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:35,651
Wolf down your food.

37
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:37,993
I was walking along
the street today...

38
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:39,998
Grandpa, would you slice me
another piece of meat?

39
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:42,000
Certainly.

40
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:45,737
Thank you.

41
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:49,569
It just so happens
that today...

42
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:52,806
I saved a boy's life.

43
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,077
Mm, that's fine.
Oh, Grandpa, you're not eating.

44
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,085
Well, doesn't anyone want to
hear about my heroic deed?

45
00:04:00,153 --> 00:04:02,417
All right, Herman.
What did you do?

46
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,684
Yes, Herman, we're listening.

47
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:06,726
I just might not tell you now.

48
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:09,557
Good.
Pass the brussels sprouts, please.

49
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:12,189
Now wait a minute.
I'm gonna tell you what happened,

50
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:14,324
and my whole family's
gonna listen!

51
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:17,063
Including
my rotten ol' father-in-law.

52
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:20,402
Okay, Pop, how did you
save a boy's life?

53
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:23,909
Well, this boy had his head
through an iron fence,

54
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:28,004
and I unbent the bars
and let him out.
Big deal.

55
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:31,710
Well, if I hadn't,
his bones would have rotted
right there on the sidewalk...

56
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:33,719
and hurt the neighborhood...

57
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:36,017
and brought down property values
and everything.

58
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:38,023
So there!

59
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:41,925
Herman Munster,
you are a plain, ordinary man...

60
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:44,122
in a plain, ordinaryjob.

61
00:04:44,197 --> 00:04:49,032
Now why must you insist
on these fantastic stories
just to get attention?

62
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:51,832
But it's true, dear!
It-It's true.
I did save his life.

63
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:54,772
And his name is
Galen Livingston Stewart,
and he's my friend.

64
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:57,036
And I'm gonna
meet him there tomorrow.

65
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,544
Herman, you and your stories.

66
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:04,209
Sometimes you act so childish,
it's hard to believe you're 150 years old.

67
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:11,484
Galen Livingston Stewart,
you and your stories.

68
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:15,255
Sometimes you act so childish,
it's hard to believe
you're nine years old.

69
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:17,319
But it did happen, Mom.

70
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:20,992
He did save my life,
and he told me
to call him Uncle Herman.

71
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:24,264
Just what did this Uncle Herman
look like, son?

72
00:05:24,337 --> 00:05:28,831
Well, he's about nine feet tall,
and his head was flat.

73
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:31,468
He had these things
sticking out of his neck.

74
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:35,310
His hands
were sewed on to his wrists,
and he's all green.

75
00:05:35,382 --> 00:05:38,510
Galen Stewart,
you get upstairs
to bed this instant.

76
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:42,077
But it's true, Mom.
There is an Uncle Herman.

77
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:44,680
All right, upstairs, young man.

78
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:47,454
And I've warned you about telling
these fantastic stories before.

79
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:49,461
Excuse me.

80
00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:55,193
I ask you, John,
where would Galen
get these ideas...

81
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:57,896
about these weird-looking,
frightening creatures?

82
00:05:57,971 --> 00:06:02,101
I don't know, dear.
Maybe he spent too much time
with your relatives.

83
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:06,211
There we are.

84
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,304
Hey, that looks pretty neat.
What is it?

85
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:12,340
What is it?
It's my old movie projector.
I got it out of the attic.

86
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,614
I'm gonna show
some of my home movies.

87
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:18,055
I put a new motor in it.

taking home movies, Grandpa?

All my life.

93
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:41,871
As a matter of fact,
I was taking movies 300 years
before the camera was invented.

94
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:44,508
- Gee, that must have been hard.
- Of course it was.

And I'll tell you something else.

96
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:50,386
There wasn't even a drugstore
to develop the film.

down at the parlor,

they put him in charge
of the complaint department.

Oh. Oh, it's you, Gale.

that can be very uncomfortable.

I'm on my way home right now.

00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:17,624
for stealing the hubcaps
off his chariot.

154
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:20,962
Boy, there was some rumble
down at the old stone bridge.

155
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:23,332
A lot of water
went under that bridge.

156
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:26,634
[Grandpa]
Yeah, and a lot ofknights too.

157
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:29,971
Oh, there are
those two fun fellows,
Burke and Hare.

158
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:33,877
I remember we were going out
on a party, and they were trying
to dig up a couple of friends.

159
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:37,906
There we are.
Typical Sunday traffic
on the Appian Way.

160
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:41,715
[Lily]
L-I think the fellow on the left
is looking for the off-ramp.

161
00:10:41,788 --> 00:10:44,313
He never did find it.

162
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,722
Well, well, well,
the old homestead.

163
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:50,194
Gale, that's where I spent
most of my childhood,

164
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:52,527
in three different jars.

165
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:58,431
[Lily]
Oh, dear, look.!
There's my old music teacher...

166
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:01,564
before he went
with Guy Lombardo.

167
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:03,575
[Eddie]
Hejust disappeared.

168
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:06,305
No, I think he just took five.

169
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:12,546
And the house has trapdoors
and secret panels.

170
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:15,610
And their little kid Eddie
has fangs and pointed ears.

171
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:20,125
And his grandfather's
about 400 years old
and looks like Dracula.

172
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:23,287
I've never heard anything
so ridiculous in my life!

173
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:27,094
And the mother has long black hair,
and she's green like Uncle Herman.

174
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,100
And they've got
a real, real neat pet,

175
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:32,535
who lives under the stairs
and breathes fire and smoke.

176
00:11:32,605 --> 00:11:35,039
And they showed home movies
of the burning of Rome...

177
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:37,770
and all that kind of stuff.
Out!

178
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:40,335
Huh?
I said out!
You get up to your room...

179
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:42,506
and don't you leave it
until you're told.

180
00:11:42,582 --> 00:11:44,516
But what if I get hungry?

181
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:47,178
Well, maybe
your green Uncle Herman...

182
00:11:47,253 --> 00:11:50,689
will come on over
with a nice big, fat, juicy
Dracula burger.

183
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:53,749
Charcoal-broiled by that pet
that lives under the stairs.

184
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:56,818
Out!
Yes, sir.

185
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:59,797
John, what are we
going to do about Galen?

186
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:04,496
His imagination is just fantastic,
those ridiculous lies.

187
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,061
I don't know.
I think it's getting serious.

188
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,233
I think I'll have to take him
to a good psychiatrist...

189
00:12:09,308 --> 00:12:12,675
and see if he can't
get to the bottom
of these weird fantasies.

190
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:14,679
John.
Hmm.

191
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:17,545
Did you make up wild stories
like that when you were his age?

192
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:19,710
Certainly not.

193
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:23,347
Well, I made up stories
about Indians and people
getting scalped...

194
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:27,018
and guys being eaten by cannibals,
but I had a perfectly normal childhood.

195
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:32,255
?? [Humming]

196
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:46,368
What are you doing,
Aunt Lily?

197
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:48,437
I'm filling the wastebaskets,
Marilyn.

198
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:51,677
Oh, dear. I hope I have
enough trash to go around.

199
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:53,742
Well, the trashman
will be here tomorrow.

200
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,754
I'm sure we can
get by till then.

201
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:57,790
Hey, Mom, is Pop home
from work yet?

202
00:12:57,857 --> 00:13:00,553
Not yet, Eddie.
He'll be here soon.

203
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:02,992
Well, I want him
to help me to find Spot.

204
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:05,257
He got out of his yard again.

205
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:07,799
Oh, dear.

206
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:10,495
The last time he got out,
he went over to Grant Avenue...

207
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,165
and ate all the tops
off the telephone poles.

208
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,174
[Door Opens, Closes]

209
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:19,507
Oh, Herman,
there you are, dear.

210
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:21,774
Hey, Pop,
have you seen Spot?

211
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:24,578
[Sighs]
No. And I didn't see
Gale either.

212
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,585
I waited for him a half hour today,
but he didn't show up.

213
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:32,056
I had to play two games
of hopscotch by myself.

214
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:36,425
Well, may-maybe he had to
stay after school or something.

215
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:38,964
No, dear, I'm afraid not.

216
00:13:39,031 --> 00:13:41,864
I haven't seen him
for three whole days.

217
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:44,402
I'm afraid he just doesn't
want to see me anymore.

218
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,404
Oh, Herman.

219
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:50,841
You can't expect to be a big hero
and save a boy's life every day.

220
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:56,507
Normal people like us
just don't have exciting adventures
all the time.

221
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:59,745
Well, my life
is duller than most.

222
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:02,185
The most exciting thing
that happened to me before this...

223
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:05,418
was 20 years ago, when a man
stopped me on the street...

224
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:08,517
and asked me if I was voting
for Alf Landon.

225
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:13,698
Well, d-don't worry
about Galen, Herman.
You'll see him again.

226
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:16,132
He's probably at home now,
playing with some friend...

227
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:19,103
who's more on
his own age level.

228
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:23,541
Sure, Pop. Come on
and help me find Spot.

229
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:27,568
Well...
I think he'll come
if you whistle for him.

230
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:29,672
All right.

231
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:35,350
Spot! Here, Spot!

232
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,755
[Foghorn Blasts]

233
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:47,424
[German Accent]
So, this, uh, playmate of yours,

234
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,561
this Uncle Herman,
is nine foot tall,

235
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:54,606
he's all green in the face.

236
00:14:54,674 --> 00:14:59,134
Und on top of his neck,
his head is bolted on, ja?

237
00:14:59,212 --> 00:15:02,807
Yes. And he lives in
a neat old haunted house
with a dungeon.

238
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:07,376
And they have a real neat pet
who lives under the stairs
and breathes fire.

239
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:11,184
You see, Mr. And Mrs. Stewart,
you have here a very intelligent boy.

240
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:14,317
He remembers all the details.
[Laughs]

241
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:18,227
Now, young man,
if you'll be so nice, you'll go
upstairs to your room and wait.

242
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:20,231
Ja? Good boy.

243
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:22,460
Stay away from the windows.

244
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,965
Uh, what do you think,
Dr. Leinbach?

245
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,564
What do I think?
Well, I think...

246
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:35,577
Well, I think that the boy
has obsessive juvenile fantasies,

247
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:38,879
coupled with
an overstimulated psyche.

248
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:44,480
In other words, he is creating
a fantasy world of his own.

249
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:48,891
See, of course, in reality,
we know that there is
no nine-foot giant.

250
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:52,419
There is no haunted house.
There is no dungeon.

251
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:54,830
- You mean he makes it all up?
- Ja.

252
00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:00,361
You see, the little Kind
looks at nothing and sees something.

253
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:04,876
Looking at nothing
and seeing something...
oh, oh, oh, that's bad.

254
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:10,612
Of course, looking at something
and seeing nothing,
that ain't so good either.

255
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:16,746
Well, what should we do,
Dr. Leinbach?

256
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:20,258
Well, the first thing
you've got to do
is to get him to a doctor.

257
00:16:20,326 --> 00:16:22,260
Well, that's why I called you.

258
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:24,353
Ja. Now let me see
if I can think of somebody.

259
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,955
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What are we doing here?

260
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:29,160
I'm a doctor.
[Laughs]

261
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:33,399
I'm a doctor.
I forget sometimes.

262
00:16:33,472 --> 00:16:36,202
Uh, what do you suggest?

263
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:40,109
Ah, well, I think
we have to rid the boy
of these illusions...

264
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:42,841
by exposing them as false.

265
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:47,147
You see, now I, myself,
will take little Galen personally
by the hand...

266
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:50,211
to this fictitious house
with these fictitious people,

267
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:53,918
and then when he sees
the reality that there is
no such house...

268
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:57,053
and there is no such people,
he's cured, ja?

269
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:59,996
Yeah.
Now, please, the boy
from the room, call down.

270
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:02,830
Call Galen.

271
00:17:02,902 --> 00:17:05,496
Galen, would you come down now?

272
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:08,039
Yeah, come on down, son.

273
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:10,507
You and me,
we're going to take a little walk...

274
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:13,340
and meet your Uncle Herman
face-to-face.

275
00:17:13,412 --> 00:17:15,937
Ja?
[Laughs]

276
00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:19,451
[Roaring]

277
00:17:19,518 --> 00:17:23,079
Now none of that, Spot.
Sit! Stay!

278
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,381
Now, Spot, cut that out.

279
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,564
That Spot.

280
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:38,660
Thanks for helping me
find him, Dad.

281
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:42,868
Oh, that's quite all right, Eddie.
But you must remember
to keep him chained in the backyard.

282
00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:46,139
And we've got to break him
of that habit of sneaking down
to the wrecking yard...

283
00:17:46,212 --> 00:17:48,146
and begging for leftovers.

284
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:50,444
Yeah. Last week he got ahold
of an old Edsel,

285
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:52,848
and he was sick for three days.

286
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:55,443
Hey, Grandpa's taking his nap.
Would you come down in the dungeon...

287
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:57,751
and run some more
of his home movies for me?

288
00:17:57,823 --> 00:18:00,053
Sure. Which ones
would you like to see, Eddie?

289
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:02,720
Oh, how about the track meet
in Transylvania you were in,

290
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:04,729
when you were a young guy?

291
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:07,630
Oh, you mean
that cross-country run?
Yeah.

292
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,032
You know, Eddie,
I was so far ahead of the pack,

293
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:14,163
the crowd had to
run after me with torches
to show me the finish line.

294
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,970
[Chuckles]
Come on.

295
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:21,911
[Wolf Howling]

296
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:25,246
See, Dr. Leinbach,
there is too such a house.

297
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:27,717
Ja, ja, I see a house.

298
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:31,382
But I also know little boys.

299
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:33,982
You see an old,
broken-down house,

300
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:38,325
and you imagine
that it's haunted with green men...
